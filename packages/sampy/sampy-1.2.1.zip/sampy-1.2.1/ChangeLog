******************************
* sampy-1.2.1 (March 2011)   *
******************************

- Updated version supporting the Web Profile:
  a) -w/--web-profile option added to sampy.py script as stand-alone
  application and b) web_profile optional argument added to
  SAMPHubServer class, in order to run the Hub enabling the Web Profile.
- Bug fixed. Host name better resolved on proxied networks.
- `sampy` script added: it is just a simple script importing SAMPy
  module and executing it calling the main routine. `sampy` has been
  thought to be a replacement of sampy.py as stand alone program
  (still running though).
- README and setup.py files updated.
- SAMPy icons added.
- Utility scripts and examples moved in more appropriated directories.
- SAMPy Hub metadata modified.
- Other minor changes and improvements.


************************************
* sampy-1.2.0 (September 2010)     *
************************************

- Fully support to SAMP_HUB environment variable as specified in SAMP
  1.2 protocol.
- Added the possibility of specify a custom lockfile explicitly when
  a new hub instance is created (-f or --lockfile from command line,
  lockfile parameter of SAMPHubServer class).
- SAMPClient and SAMPIntegratedClient updated adding a generic
  bindReceiveMessage method, which allows to bind a single function
  to calls and notifications.
- Added SAMPMsgReplierWrapper decorator class/function, useful to
  wrap bound functions that might return a response (calls or generic
  functions passed to bindReceiveMessage). This decorator accepts
  a client instance as argument and allows to return response 
  parameters as a simple map (without the need of explicitly call 
  the reply operation).
- eclient.py example script added showing the decorators use.
- http_file_server.py utility script added. It is able to serve a
  lockfile (or any other file) through an HTTP address.
