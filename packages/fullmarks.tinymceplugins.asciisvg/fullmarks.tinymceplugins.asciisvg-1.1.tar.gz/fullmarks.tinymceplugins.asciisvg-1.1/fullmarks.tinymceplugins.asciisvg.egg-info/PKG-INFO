Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A TinyMCE plugin for Plone to render a function of a graph as SVG and it
        requires a browser that can render SVG.
        
        It is based on the TinyMCE plugin written by David Lippman as part of
        the IMathAS project: http://www.imathas.com/. A demo of the IMathAS
        version of the plugin is available here:
        http://www.imathas.com/editordemo/demo.html
        
        For FullMarks (and Plone), the plugin has been modified to always render
        SVG and not use any fallbacks that generate images server-side.
        
        Additionally it uses the latest version (ver 2.0) of the ASCIIMATH
        javascript library by Peter Jipsen available here:
        http://mathcs.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html
        
        This plugin was developed as part of the FullMarks project funded by the
        Shuttleworth Foundation, an open educational repository of model
        questions and answers. See http://www.fullmarks.org.za and
        http://github.com/fullmarks for more information.
