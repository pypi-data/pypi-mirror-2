Description: slapos.recipe.java
        =====================
        
        This recipe downloads and installs java in your buildout.
        
        Buildout configuration:
        -----------------------
        
        Add this section to your buildout configuration::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ... your other parts ...
        java
        ...
        
        [java]
        recipe = slapos.recipe.java
        
        By default it will fetch Java 6u25, but you might want to install from another location or another version like this::
        
        [java]
        recipe = slapos.recipe.java
        download-url = ftp://location/to/self-extracting/java.bin
        
        Or you can install openjdk instead.
        
        [java]
        recipe = slapos.recipe.java
        flavour = openjdk
        
        
        Notes:
        ------
        
        This recipe only works with linux at the moment
        
        This recipe requires rpm2cpio and cpio to be installed on your system.
