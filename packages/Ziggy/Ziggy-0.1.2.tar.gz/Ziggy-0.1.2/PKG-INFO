        Ziggy provides a collection of python methods for Hadoop Streaming. Ziggy is
        useful for building complex MapReduce programs, using Hadoop for batch processing
        of many files, Monte Carlo processes, graph algorithms, and common utility tasks (e.g. sort, search).
        Typical usage
        often looks like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            import ziggy.hdmc as hdmc
        	from glob import glob
        	
        	files_to_process = glob("/some/path/*")
        	results = hdmc.submit_checkpoint_inline(script_to_run, output_filename, files_to_process, argument_string)
            
        To install run::
        
        	python setup.py hadoop
        	python setup.py install
        
        Ziggy was authored by Dan McClary, Ph.D. and originates in the
         `Amaral Lab at Northwestern University <http://amaral.northwestern.edu>`_.
