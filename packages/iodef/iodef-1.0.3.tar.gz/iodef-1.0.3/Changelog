This is a Changelog for the iodef python library.

1.0.3 - 08 May 2010 - pc
        - fix Impact being exported twice, once as an MLString and once
          as a content.
        - fix Postal Address, too, as it had the same problem.
        - added timezone info to some sample scripts.

1.0.2 - 06 May 2010 - pc
	- Deprecated exportS as a kind soul pointed out the error
	  in my use of export.
	- Fixed a namespace problem in PhraudReport.
	- Added a couple more options to the sample_build_phish_cheap 
	  script.

1.0.1 - 23 Apr 2010 - pc
	- Fix a bad setup pointer for pypi.

1.0 - 23 Apr 2010 - pc
	- Added exportS methods to all classes to export
	  an XML string to a string object. [The built-in export
	  method required a file object.]
	- Tested marshalling and unmarshalling with a group
	  of example scripts.
	- Structured the module to support the phish extensions.
	- Added validation support. This caused the module structure 
	  to change as decoding the 'AdditionalData' elements causes 
	  some looping when importing modules. The modules all became
	  packages to deal with this, and so the package structure 
	  changed.

0.6 - 19 Mar 2010
	- Add a new method 'toPython' to a few classes. The method
	  will dump the XML as a python set. This is a test.
	- Fixed the default namespace in builder.

0.5 - 29 Jan 2010
	Add components to make a package.
	Fix bugs discovered in validation testing.
		- add default xmlns to generated IODEF-Document
		- fix times to be 'XML time', with the 'T'
		
0.4 - 05 Jan 2010
        Initial Distribution.
