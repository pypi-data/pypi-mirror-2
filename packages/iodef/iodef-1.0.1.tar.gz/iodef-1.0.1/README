This is the README for the IODEF library:

This python library contains the low-level routines to generate 
IETF RFC5070 compatible documents. RFC5070 defines IODEF - the 
Incident Object Description Exchange Format - that specifies an
XML encoding to report, share, and archive network event data.
RFC5070 is available at: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt .

The library contains a number of directories:
iodef	- the base RFC5070-defined XML elements.
phish  	- Routines to support the phishing extensions defined by
	  RFCxxxx and the APWG.
examples - to show how things work and test your thoughts.


Examples using this library, the iodef XML schema, and other
documentation and helpful data is available at
	http://sourceforge.net/ecrispx-x

A bug tracker is located, there, too, if you find the one bug we left 
in.
