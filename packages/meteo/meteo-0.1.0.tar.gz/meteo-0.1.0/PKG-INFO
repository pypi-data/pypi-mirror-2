        Meteo is a library in development to work with meteorological data. It
        currently has procedures for moisture variable conversions between relative
        humidity, mixing ratio and specific humidity::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from meteo import *
        
            # calculate saturation pressure
            print(esat(282.15))
