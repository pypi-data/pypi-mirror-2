        ======================
        
        This applicaiton is a paypal backend for django-SHOP, or any other shop system
        implementing its shop interface.
        It uses django-paypal as a way to actually communicate with paypal.
        
        Usage
        ======
        
        Add django-paypal and this project to your INSTALLED_APPS:::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS = (
          ...
          'paypal.standard.ipn',
          'shop_paypal',
          ...
          )
        
        Add 'shop_paypal.offsite_paypal.OffsitePaypalBackend' to django-SHOP's SHOP_PAYMENT_BACKENDS
        setting.
        
        Make sure you set following in settings.py:
        
        * `PAYPAL_RECEIVER_EMAIL`
        * `PAYPAL_CURRENCY_CODE` (see https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_nvp_currency_codes)
        
        Optional settings:
        
        * `PAYPAL_LC` - paypal language (see: https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?&cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_api_nvp_country_codes)
        
        Todo
        =====
        
        Plenty of stuff is left to do! If you feel like giving a hand, please pick a task
        in the follwing list:
        
        * Implement more functionalities from django-paypal in different backends 
          (one for direct payments, one for professional accounts...)
        * Port the shop API to other shop systems, so they can also easily use this 
          project as a backend. Examples include but are not limited to: plata, satchmo, 
          lfs
