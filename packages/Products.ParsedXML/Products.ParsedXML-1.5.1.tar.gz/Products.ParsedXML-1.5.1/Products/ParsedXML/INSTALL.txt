Requirements

  This release requires Zope 2.6.2 or later. You also need the
  xml.parsers.expat library installed. Recent Python versions should
  come with this installed, but if this is missing, install PyXML (see
  http://pyxml.sourceforge.net) for the Python that is used by your Zope.

Installation

  Unpack the ParsedXML tarball in the Products directory of your Zope
  installation (usually this is lib/python/Products). Rename the unpacked
  directory to "ParsedXML" so that Python can import it.

  Restart Zope.  There should be a ParsedXML product in your Products
  folder, and a ParsedXML option for available objects to add in
  the root folder.
