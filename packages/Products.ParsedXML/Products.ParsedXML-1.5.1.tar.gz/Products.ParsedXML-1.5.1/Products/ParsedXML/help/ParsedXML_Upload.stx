ParsedXML - Upload: Upload XML

    Description

        This view allows you to upload XML source at a particular
        node.  A file can be chosen from your local computer.  When it
        is uploaded, it will be parsed.

        If the parse succeeds, the node that the upload is calle on
        will be replaced with the parsed tree.  If the parse fails,
        you will be presented with an error message.
