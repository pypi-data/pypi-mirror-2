ParsedXML - Raw: Download unformatted XML
  
    Description

        Clicking on the Raw tab will send the XML source for that node
        to your browser, unformatted, with a content-type of
        'text/xml'.

        This is also the index_html method, so navigating to a node
        without a different view will also download the source.
