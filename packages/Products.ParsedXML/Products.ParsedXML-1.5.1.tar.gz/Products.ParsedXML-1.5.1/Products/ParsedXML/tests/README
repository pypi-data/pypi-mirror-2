Parsed XML test README

Using the test suite

 You need to have ZopeTestCase (tested with 0.9) installed in your Zope's
 lib/python/Testing directory. For ZopeTestCase, see here:

 http://zope.org/Members/shh/ZopeTestCase

 After setting your SOFTWARE_HOME and INSTANCE_HOME variables as
 instructed by ZopeTestCase, you can run 'runalltests.py' to run all
 the tests.
 
 There are also a few 'demo' test modules available. You can run them
 individually, keeping in mind that the tests won't pass.

Running tests individually

 You can also run each test individually, for instance::

   python test_dom.py

 Again you have to make sure you set SOFTWARE_HOME and INSTANCE_HOME.

Debugging with the test suite

 If you want to contribute changes to ParsedXML, please run the test
 suite to make sure that your changes don't break anything.

 The tests themselves are in test_domapi.py.

 The test suite checks for compliance with the Python IDL mapping with
 the DOM specification.  As of this writing nearly all of DOM level 2
 is tested, along with a few level 3 interfaces.

 Some Parsed XML specific tests are run as well, if the implementation
 supports those features, such as persistence, parsing, and printing.

 The suite is very useful for testing extensions to Parsed XML that
 provide full DOM capabilities.  We run the tests on both our
 ManageableDOM and DOM layers - if it works for DOM, it should work
 for ManageableDOM, which proxies the entire DOM interface.
