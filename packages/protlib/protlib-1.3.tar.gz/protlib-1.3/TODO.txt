Specifying byte order on a per-ctype basis:
 - different structs having different byte orders
 - different byte orders on different fields within the same struct
 - struct and array byte orders pass to their descendants
 - BYTE_ORDER simply the default when nothing is specified

Examples with memory-mapping:
 - basic C program
 - maybe even C++ and boost?
