CError should extend ValueError, not BaseException.

Support for parsing unicode strings

Set the delay parameter on the default RotatingFileHandler objects when the
version of Python is at least 2.6.2

Bundle ez_setup.py in case setuptools isn't installed.
 - Make sure that this is even necessary with 2.6+

Specifying byte order on a per-ctype basis:
 - different structs having different byte orders
 - different byte orders on different fields within the same struct
 - struct and array byte orders pass to their descendants
 - BYTE_ORDER simply the default when nothing is specified

Variable-length structs:
 - CString, CArray, length would be the value of any other field
 - sizeof, repr, serialize need to all work properly
 - parsing needs to continue to give decent warnings and errors

Examples with memory-mapping:
 - basic C program
 - maybe even C++ and boost?

Deal with thread safety issues involved in warnings.catch_warnings
