protlib makes it easy to implement binary network protocols. It uses
the struct and SocketServer modules from the standard library. It
provides support for default and constant struct fields, nested structs, 
arrays of structs, better handling for strings and arrays, struct 
inheritance, and convenient syntax for instantiating and using your 
custom structs.

protlib requires Python 2.6 or any later version in the 2.x line.
