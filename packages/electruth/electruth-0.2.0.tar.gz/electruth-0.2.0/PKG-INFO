        =========
        
        electruth is a collection of boolean logic tools. It can be used as
        both a command-line tool and a Python library. It understands boolean
        algebra (to some extent) and can be used to simplify boolean
        expressions using the Quine-McClusky method. This can be useful if you
        have a truth table in need of basic shortening. electruth can also be
        used to compare boolean expressions, which can be very useful if you
        need to compare a truth table with a schematic you created based on
        that truth table. electruth can also be used to transform complex
        boolean expressions into simpler ones consisting only of ANDS, ORS and
        NOTS.
        
        
        License
        =======
        
        electruth is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public
        License version 3 (or any later version). The author of electruth is
        Niels Serup, contactable at ns@metanohi.org. This is version 0.2.0 of
        the program, the first version to support Python 3.1+ (if you need
        support for Python 2.6+, you should download v0.1.1).
        
        The libraries used by electruth are GPL-compatible.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Way #1
        ------
        Just run this (requires that you have python-setuptools installed)::
        
          $ sudo easy_install3 electruth
        
        Way #2
        ------
        Get the newest version of electruth at
        http://metanohi.org/projects/electruth/ or at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/electruth
        
        Extract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::
        
          # python3 setup.py install
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Python 3.1+ is a requirement.
        
        ``qvikconfig``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/qvikconfig/
         + License: GPLv3+
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install qvikconfig``
         + Author: Niels Serup
        
        Note that ``qvikconfig`` is included with electruth, so you don't really
        have to install it.
        
        Optional extras
        ---------------
        If present, electruth will also use these Python modules:
        
        ``termcolor``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor/
         + License: GPLv3+
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install termcolor``
         + Author: Konstantin Lepa <konstantin lepa at gmail com>
        
        Note that ``termcolor`` is included with electruth, so you don't
        really have to install it.
         
        ``setproctitle``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/
         + License: New BSD License
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install setproctitle``
         + Author: Daniele Varrazzo <daniele varrazzo at gmail com>
        
        
        Use
        ===
        
        Installing electruth installs a command-line utility named
        ``electruth``. This program has many settings, and it's recommended to
        run ``electruth --help`` to get an overview of them.
        
        The program creates boolean expressions from whatever input you give
        it. If you give it more than one input, it will compare the two inputs
        (unless if you tell it not to do that). Many inputs are supported:
        
        * Basic boolean expressions (e.g. ``A and (B or C)`` or ``A * (B +
          C)`` (the same))
        * Truthtables, using tab-separated (.tsv) or comma-separated (.csv)
          values in a file, the first row specifying the names of the inputs
          and outputs with a ``<`` prefix for inputs and a ``>`` prefix for
          outputs.
        * Netlists (.net), e.g. those generated from ``gnetlist`` from the gEDA
          project (gEDA schematics from ``gschem`` can also be loaded, but
          they will be converted to netlists (saved in temporary files) at
          first).
        
        Some settings can also be set in a config file. Config files use a
        ``property = value`` syntax (e.g. ``auto compare = false``) separated
        by newlines.
