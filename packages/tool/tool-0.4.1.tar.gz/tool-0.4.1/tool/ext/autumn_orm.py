Autumn ORM
==========

.. warning::

    This module does **not** work because Autumn seems to stick to the global
    connection object and not allow us to bind it to the application object.
    For example, when we try creating a model, everything breaks if the
    *global* connection is undefined.

Support for Autumn_, a lightweight Python ORM.

    Autumn exists as a super-lightweight Object-relational mapper (ORM) for
    Python. Itâ€™s an alternative to (not a replacement of) SQLObject,
    SQLAlchemy, Storm, etc. Perhaps the biggest difference is the automatic
    population of fields as attributes.

API reference

"""
from autumn.db.connection import Database
from autumn.db.query import Query
from tool.plugins import BasePlugin


class Autumn(BasePlugin):
    """Adds the ORM feature.

    Required configuration options:

    :param db_type: database type: either ``mysql`` or ``sqlite``.

    Depending on the database type, certain positional (`db_args`) and/or
    keyword arguments (`db_kwargs`) are also required. They are passed directly
    to the database driver, i.e. `sqlite3.connect` or `MySQLdb.connect`.

    Example configuration (YAML)::

        tool.ext.autumn_orm.Autumn:
            db_type: sqlite
            db_args: [test.db]

    In order to use `Autumn` with database connection configured via standard
    Tool configuration method, you can either access the :meth:`connection` or
    use the :meth:`query` method. Here are two equally acceptable approaches::

        from tool import app

        orm = app.get_feature('orm')

        # shortcut
        items = orm.query(Item, price=123)

        # Autumn API (note the orm.connection!)
        Query(conditions={'price: 123}, model=Item, db=orm.connection)

    .. warning::

        You should never use methods such as `Model.get` because they imply
        global connection which is not supported by this extension. Always pass
        the actual connection object where possible.
