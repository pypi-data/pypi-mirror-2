Installation instructions
=========================

pytilities can be installed using the standard PyPI installation procedure. If you don't know how that works, then read on.

You have 2 options: either do a distutils installation, or use EasyInstall (or you might even find it with your os' package manager, which is always the best choice).

distutils

- `Download <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytilities/>`_ the library from PyPI, and extract it.
- Continue with `these instructions <http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial#DistutilsInstallation>`_

EasyInstall
