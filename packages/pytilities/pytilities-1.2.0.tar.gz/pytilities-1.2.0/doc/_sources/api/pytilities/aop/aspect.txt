======================

.. automodule:: pytilities.aop.aspect

   .. autoclass:: Aspect

      .. attribute:: _advice_mappings

         Mappings of (access, attribute_name) to advice to give or None, where
         access is either 'get', 'set', 'delete' or 'call'.  Default value is 
         {}.

         Check `Advisor.is_advisable` for rules on valid attribute_name's

      .. attribute:: _undefined_keys

         Boolean that indicates whether or not advice mappings has a sensible
         result for keys(). Default is False.

         Some mappings do not support keys because their set of keys is infinite
         or hard to determine. (FunctionMap is an example of such Mappings)

         If set to True, the aspect can only be applied to objects with AOPMeta 
         as metaclass.
