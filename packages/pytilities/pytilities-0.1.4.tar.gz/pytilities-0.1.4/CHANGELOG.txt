0.1.4
    * Mangle, mangling and event.dispatcher: fixed a slight name clash
    * Overhauled testing, it is now easier to use
    * Removed inheritance feature of DelegatorFactory, it was too vague
    * Removed __init_delegation_profiles, there are other ways to achieve the same thing
    * Changed the DelegatorFactory interface so that it is hopefully more intuitive to use
    * Added all set operators to delegation.Profile
    * Added more tests and fixed some docstrings
    * RestrictedDispatcher: Made allow and disallow mutually exclusive. It made no sense to specify both

0.1.3
    * Added html reference documentation

0.1.2
    * Added runtests.py, which allows running the unit tests
    * Added the types package (forgot this in last release)
