Description:     pytilities is a utility library for developers.
        
            It has the following features:
        
                - delegation: decorate classes with attributes that are delegated to a
                target object without having to write those attributes on the decorating
                class
        
                - event dispatching: Observer/Listener like event dispatching with wrappers
                for hiding events on dispatchers and combining dispatchers
        
                - function overloading
        
                - various: a NumberType (anything numeric), a mangle function, ...
        
            Tested on python 2.6, it may work on other versions as well.
