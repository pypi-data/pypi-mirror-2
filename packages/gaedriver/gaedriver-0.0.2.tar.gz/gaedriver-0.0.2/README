gaedriver is a tool to support end-to-end test automated for App
Engine apps.


Motivation
===========

Before you can run your end-to-end tests, you need to bring up your
test environment. For App Engine apps, this usually means starting
dev_appserver or deploying an application. The gaedriver package
allows you to do those things with an API.


Current status
==============

pre-alpha - We try to understand what's needed and how we can solve it
in the scope of this project.
