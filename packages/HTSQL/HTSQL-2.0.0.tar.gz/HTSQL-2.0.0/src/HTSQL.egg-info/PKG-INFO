Description: =======================================================
        HTSQL -- A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
        =======================================================
        
        HTSQL ("Hyper Text Structured Query Language") is a high-level query
        language for relational databases.   The target audience for HTSQL is
        the accidental programmer -- one who is not a SQL expert, yet needs a
        usable, comprehensive query tool for data access and reporting.  
        
        HTSQL is also a web service which takes a request via HTTP, translates
        it into a SQL query, executes the query against a relational database,
        and returns the results in a format requested by the user agent (JSON,
        CSV, HTML, etc.).
        
        Use of HTSQL with open source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) is
        royalty free under BSD-style conditions.  Use of HTSQL with proprietary
        database systems (Oracle, Microsoft SQL) requires a commercial license.
        See ``LICENSE`` for details.
        
        For installation instructions, see ``INSTALL``.  For list of new
        features in this release, see ``NEWS``.  HTSQL documentation is in the
        ``doc`` directory.

        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        Download HTSQL source code::
        
            $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/prometheus/htsql
        
        Build and install HTSQL::
        
            $ cd htsql
            $ make build
            # make install
        
        Installing HTSQL creates a ``htsql-ctl`` script.  For general help and
        a list of commands, run::
        
            $ htsql-ctl help
        
        To start a command-line HTSQL shell, run::
        
            $ htsql-ctl shell DBURI
        
        To start an HTTP server running HTSQL, run::
        
            $ htsql-ctl server DBURI [HOST [PORT]]
        
        Here, ``DBURI`` specifies how to connect to the database and must have
        the form::
        
            ENGINE://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DATABASE

        List of Changes
        ===============
        
        
        2.0.0 final (2011-02-01)
        ------------------------
        
        * Merged `/:json` and `/:jsonex` formatters; use `/:jsonex` layout
          to avoid CSRF issues.
        * Documentation updates.
        
        
        2.0.0 rc 1 (2011-01-21)
        -----------------------
        
        * HTRAF demo is promoted to a standalone project; see
          http://bitbucket.org/prometheus/htraf.
        * Added `/:jsonex` format: JSON with extra metadata.
        * Documentation updates.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 5 (2010-12-14)
        -------------------------
        
        * Completed the SQLite backend.
        * Completed the standard library.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 4 (2010-12-05)
        -------------------------
        
        * Refactored peep-hole optimization of the frame tree and SQL
          serialization; refined the generated SQL.
        * Refactored the internal API for adding functions.
        * Added new (experimental) syntax for infix function call.
        * Added an "Examples" section to the documentation.
        * Fixed compatibility with Python 2.5.
        * Many minor bugfixes, documentation updates, etc.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 3 (2010-11-09)
        -------------------------
        
        * Refactored the translator from the term tree to the frame tree;
          added a new translation step to collapse nested frames and reduce
          SQL expressions.
        * Added the HTRAF demo: use HTSQL with client-side javascript
          to define complex dashboards.
        * Added the SSI demo: using HTSQL for web without giving direct access
          to the database.
        * Updated the tutorial, minor bugfixes, regression test updates, etc.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 2 (2010-10-01)
        -------------------------
        
        * Refactored the translator from the expression graph to the term tree.
        * Added `Content-Disposition` header to `:json` and `:csv` renderers.
        * Merged the tutorial to the repository.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 1 (2010-09-21)
        -------------------------
        
        * Initial beta release.
        * PostgreSQL and SQLite backends are (mostly) supported, the former
          more than the latter.
        * The SQL translator needs more work, in particular, the term tree,
          the frame structure and the serializer.
        * Lots of functions are either not implemented or missing a proper
          serializer, especially in the SQLite backend.
        * Other areas which need more work before the final release: rendering,
          introspection, regression tests and documentation.
