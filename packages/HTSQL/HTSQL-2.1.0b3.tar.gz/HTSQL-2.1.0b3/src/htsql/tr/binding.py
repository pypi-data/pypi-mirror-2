    """
    Represents a binding node.

    This is an abstract class; see subclasses for concrete binding nodes.

    A binding tree (technically, a DAG) is an intermediate stage of the HTSQL
    translator.  A binding tree is translated from the syntax tree by the
    *binding* process.  A binding tree is translated to a code tree by the
    *encoding* process.

    The following adapters are associated with the binding process and generate
    new binding nodes::

        Bind: (Syntax, BindingState) -> Binding, ...
        Lookup: (Binding, IdentifierSyntax) -> Binding

    See :class:`htsql.tr.bind.Bind` and :class:`htsql.tr.lookup.Lookup` for
    more details.

    The following adapters are associated with the encoding process and
    convert binding nodes to code and space nodes::

        Encode: (Binding, EncodingState) -> Code
        Relate: (Binding, EncodingState) -> Space

    See :class:`htsql.tr.encode.Encode` and :class:`htsql.tr.encode.Relate`
    for more details.

    The constructor arguments:

    `domain` (:class:`htsql.domain.Domain`)
        The type of the binding node; use :class:`htsql.domain.VoidDomain`
        instance when not applicable.

    `syntax` (:class:`htsql.tr.syntax.Syntax`)
        The syntax node that generated the binding node; should be used
        for presentation or error reporting only, there is no guarantee
        that that the syntax node is semantically, or even syntaxically
        valid.

    Other attributes:

    `mark` (:class:`htsql.mark.Mark`)
        The location of the node in the original query (for error reporting).

    Each link binding has an associated `base` parent node.  The base node

    on the concrete binding type.
    
    Chain bindings together with their bases form a subtree (or a forest)
    in the binding graph.

    Chain bindings are typically (but not always) generated by the lookup
    adapter; that is, `Lookup` applied to a base node generates a link
    binding with the given base.

    Chaing bindings are often expected to correspond to some space nodes;
    therefore they should have a non-trivial implementation of the `Relate`
    adapter.
