    >>> from htsql import HTSQL
    >>> app = HTSQL(db)

where `db` is a connection URI, a string of the form::

    engine://username:password@host:port/database

`engine`
    The type of the database server; ``pgsql`` or ``sqlite``.

`username:password`
    Used for authentication; optional.

`host:port`
    The server address; optional.

`database`
    The name of the database; for SQLite, the path to the database file.

To execute a WSGI request, run
