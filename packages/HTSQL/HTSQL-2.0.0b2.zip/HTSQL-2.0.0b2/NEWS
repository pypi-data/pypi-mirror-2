List of Changes
===============


2.0.0 beta 2 (2010-10-01)
-------------------------

* Refactored the translator from the expression graph to the term tree.
* Added `Content-Disposition` header to `:json` and `:csv` renderers.
* Merged the tutorial to the repository.


2.0.0 beta 1 (2010-09-31)
-------------------------

* Initial beta release.
* PostgreSQL and SQLite backends are (mostly) supported, the former
  more than the latter.
* The SQL translator needs more work, in particular, the term tree,
  the frame structure and the serializer.
* Lots of functions are either not implemented or missing a proper
  serializer, especially in the SQLite backend.
* Other areas which need more work before the final release: rendering,
  introspection, regression tests and documentation.
