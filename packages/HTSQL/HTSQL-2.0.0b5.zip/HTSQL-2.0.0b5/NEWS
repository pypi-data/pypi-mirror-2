2.0.0 beta 3 (2010-11-09)

2.0.0 beta 1 (2010-09-21)
-------------------------

* Initial beta release.
* PostgreSQL and SQLite backends are (mostly) supported, the former
  more than the latter.
* The SQL translator needs more work, in particular, the term tree,
  the frame structure and the serializer.
* Lots of functions are either not implemented or missing a proper
  serializer, especially in the SQLite backend.
* Other areas which need more work before the final release: rendering,
  introspection, regression tests and documentation.
