    """
    Represents an expression node.

    This is an abstract class; its subclasses are divided into two categories:
    space nodes (see :class:`Space`) and code nodes (see :class:`Code`).
    There are also several expression node types that do not belong to either
    of these categories.

    An expression tree (a DAG) is an intermediate stage of the HTSQL
    translator.  An expression tree is translated from a binding tree by
    the *encoding* process.  It is then translated to a frame structure
    by the *compiling* and *assembling* processes.

    The following adapters are associated with the encoding process and
    generate new code and space nodes::

        Encode: (Binding, EncodingState) -> Code
        Relate: (Binding, EncodingState) -> Space

    See :class:`htsql.tr.encode.Encode` and :class:`htsql.tr.encode.Relate`
    for more detail.

    The compiling process works as follows.  Space nodes (and also unit nodes)
    are translated to frame nodes via several intermediate steps::

        Compile: (Space, CompilingState) -> Term
        Assemble: (Term, AssemblingState) -> Frame

    Code nodes are directly translated to phrase nodes::

        Evaluate: (Code, AssemblingState) -> Phrase

    See :class:`htsql.tr.compile.Compile, :class:`htsql.tr.assemble.Assemble`,
    :class:`htsql.tr.assemble.Evaluate` for more detail.

    Expression nodes support equality by value (as opposed to to equality
    by identity, which is the default for class instances).  That is, two
    expression nodes are equal if they are of the same type and all their
    (essential) attributes are equal.  Some attributes (e.g. `binding) may
    be considered not essential and do not participate in comparison.  To
    facilitate expression comparison, :class:`htsql.domain.Domain` objects
    also support equality by value.  By-value semantics is respected when
    expression nodes are used as dictionary keys.

    The constructor arguments:

    `binding` (:class:`htsql.tr.binding.Binding`)
        The binding node that gave rise to the expression; should be used
        only for presentation or error reporting.

    `equality_vector` (an immutable tuple or ``None``)
        Encapsulates all essential attributes of a node.  Two expression
        nodes are considered equal if they are of the same type and their
        equality vectors are equal.  If ``None``, the node is compared by
        identity.

        Note that the `binding` attribute is not essential and should not
        be a part of the equality vector.

    Other attributes:

    `syntax` (:class:`htsql.tr.syntax.Syntax`)
        The syntax node that gave rise to the expression; for debugging
        purposes only.

    `mark` (:class:`htsql.mark.Mark`)
        The location of the node in the original query; for error reporting.

    `hash` (an integer)
        The node hash; if two nodes are considered equal, their hashes
        must be equal too.

class Space(Expression):
    """
    Represents a space node.

    A space is an expression that represents an (ordered multi-) set of rows.
    Among others, we consider the following kinds of spaces:

    *The scalar space* `I`
        A space with only one row.

    *A table space* `T`
        Given a table `T`, the space consists of all rows of the table.

    *A direct product space* `A * T`
        Given a table `T` and another space `A`, the direct product space
        consists of pairs `(a, t)` where `a` runs over rows of `A` and
        `t` runs over rows of `T`.

        Note that a table space is a special case of a direct product space:
        `T` is equivalent to `I * T`.

        Table `T` in `A * T` is called *the prominent table* of the space.

    *A fiber product space* `A . T` or `A .j T`
        Given a space `A` with the prominent table `S`, another table `T`
        and a join condition `j` between tables `S` and `T`, the fiber
        product space consists of pairs `(a, t)` from `A * T` satisfying
        the join condition `j`.

        Table `T` is called the prominent table of `A . T`.

    *A filtered space* `A ? p`
        Given a space `A` and a predicate `p` defined on `A`, the
        filtered space consists of rows of `A` satisfying condition `p`.

    *An ordered space* `A [e,...]`
        Given a space `A` and a list of expressions `e,...`, the
        ordered space consists of rows of `A` reordered by the values
        of expressions.

    Note that all these examples (except for the scalar space) share the same
    form: they take an existing space, called *the base space* and apply some
    operation to produce a new space.  Thus *any space could be expressed
    as an application of a series of elementary operations to the scalar
    space*.

    Each subclass of :class:`Space` represents an operation that is applied
    to a base space.  We could classify the operations (and therefore
    :class:`Space` subclasses) into two groups: those which keep the row
    shape of the base space and those which expand it.  The latter are
    called *axis spaces*.  We also regard the scalar space as an axis space.

    Take an arbitrary space `A` and consider it as a sequence of
    operations applied to the scalar space.  If we then reapply only
    the axis operations from the sequence, we obtain a new space `A'`,
    which we call *the inflation* of `A`.  Note that `A` is a subset
    of the inflated space `A'`.

    Now we can establish how different spaces are related to each other.
    For that we will introduce a notion of *convergency* between two
    arbitrary spaces.  Informally, convergency describes how two spaces
    `A` and `B` can be naturally attached to each other.  When rows
    in `A` and `B` have the same shape, convergency is reduced to equality,
    that is, a row from `A` converges to an equal row from `B` if the latter
    exists.  When rows in `A` and `B` have different shapes, we need
    to determine their longest common prefix.  Then a row from `A`
    converges to all rows from `B` that share the same prefix values.

    Formally, for each pair of spaces `A` and `B`, we define a relation
    `<->` ("converges to") on rows from `A` and `B`, that is, a subset
    of the Cartesian product `A x B`, by the following rules:

    (1) For any space `A`, `<->` is the identity relation on `A`,
        that is, each row converges only to itself.

        For two spaces `A` and `B` where `A` is a subset of `B`,
        each row from `A` converges to an equal row from `B`.  In
        particular, this defines `<->` on any space `A` and its inflated
        space `A'`, as well as on any non-axis space `A` and its base
        space `B`.

    (2) Suppose `A` and `B` are spaces such that `A` is an axis space
        and `B` is the base of `A`.  It means that each element of `A`
        has the form `(b, t)` where `b` is some row from `B`. Then
        row `a` from `A` converges to row `b` from `B` if `a` has the
        form `a = (b, t)` for some `t`.

        By transitivity, we could extend `<->` on `A` and any of its
        *prefix spaces*, that is, the base of `A`, the base of the base
        of `A` and so on.  For instance, let `B` be the base space
        of `A` and let `C` be the base space of `B`.  Then `a` from `A`
        converges to `c` from `C` if there exists row `b` from `B`
        such that `a <-> b` and `b <-> c`.

        In particular, this defines `<->` on an arbitrary space `A`
        and the scalar space `I` since `I` is a prefix for any space.
        By the above definition, any row of `A` converges to the (only)
        row of `I`.

    (3) Finally, we are ready to define `<->` on an arbitrary pair
        of spaces `A` and `B`.  First, suppose that `A` and `B`
        share the same inflated space: `A' = B'`.  Then we could
        define `<->` on `A` and `B` transitively via `A'`: `a` from `A`
        converges to `b` from `B` if there exists `a'` from `A'` such
        that `a <-> a'` and `a' <-> b`.

        In the general case, find the longest prefixes `C` of `A`
        and `D` of `B` such that `C` and `D` have the same
        inflated space: `C' = D'`.  Rules `(1)` and `(2)` establish
        `<->` for the pairs `A` and `C`, `C` and `C' = D'`,
        `C' = D'` and `D`, and `D` and `B`.  We define `<->`
        on `A` and `B` transitively: `a` from `A` converges to
        `b` from `B` if there exist rows `c` from `C`,
        `c'` from `C' = D'`, `d` from `D` such that
        `a <-> c <-> c' <-> d <-> b`.

        Note that it is important that we take among the common inflated
        prefixes the longest one.  Any two spaces have a common inflated
        prefix: the scalar space.  If the scalar space is, indeed, the
        longest common inflated prefix of `A` and `B`, then each
        row of `A` converges to every row of `B`.

    Now we are ready to introduce several very important relations between
    spaces:

    `A` *spans* `B`
        A space `A` spans a space `B` if for every row `a` from `A`:

            `card { b` from `B | a <-> b } <= 1`.

        Informally, it means that the statement::

            SELECT * FROM A

        and the statement::

            SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON (A <-> B)

        produce the same number of rows.

    `A` *dominates* `B`
        A space `A` dominates a space `B` if `A` spans `B` and
        for every row `b` from `B`:

            `card { a` from `A | a <-> b } >= 1`.

        Informally, it implies that the statement::

            SELECT * FROM B INNER JOIN A ON (A <-> B)

        and the statement::

            SELECT * FROM B LEFT OUTER JOIN A ON (A <-> B)

        produce the same number of rows.

    `A` *conforms* `B`
        A space `A` conforms a space `B` if `A` dominates `B`
        and `B` dominates `A`.  Alternatively, we could say
        `A` conforms `B` if the `<->` relation establishes
        a bijection between `A` and `B`.

        Informally, it means that the statement::

            SELECT * FROM A

        and the statement::

            SELECT * FROM B

        produce the same number of rows.

        Note that `A` conforming `B` is not the same as `A` being equal
        to `B`; even if `A` conforms `B`,  rows of `A` and `B` may
        have different shapes, therefore as sets, they are different.

    Now take an arbitrary space `A` and its base space `B`.  We say:

    `A` *contracts* `B`
        A space `A` contracts its base `B` if for any row from `B`
        there is no more than one converging row from `A`.

        Typically, it is non-axis spaces that contract their bases,
        although in some cases, an axis space could do it too.

    `A` *expands* `B`
        A space `A` expands its base `B` if for any row from `B`
        there is at least one converging row from `A`.

        Note that it is possible that a space `A` both contracts and
        expands its base `B`, and also that `A` neither contracts
        nor expands `B`.  The former means that `A` conforms `B`.
        The latter holds, in particular, for the direct product space
        `A * T`.  `A * T` violates the contraction condition when
        `T` contains more than one row and violates the expansion
        condition when `T` has no rows.

    A few words about how rows of a space are ordered.  The default
    (also called *weak*) ordering rules are:

    - a table space `T = I * T` is sorted by the lexicographic order
      of the table primary key;

    - a non-axis space keeps the order of its base;

    - an axis space `A * T` or `A . T` respects the order its base `A`;
      rows with the same base element are sorted by the table order.

    An alternative sort order could be specified explicitly (also called
    *strong* ordering).  Whenever strong ordering is  specified, it
    overrides the weak ordering.  Thus, rows of an ordered space `A [e]`
    are sorted first by expression `e`, and then rows which are not
    differentiated by `e` are sorted using the weak ordering of `A`.
    However, if `A` already has a strong ordering, it must be respected.
    Therefore, the general rule for sorting `A [e]` is:

    - first, sort the space by the strong ordering of `A`;

    - then, by `e`;

    - finally, by the weak ordering of `A`.

    Class attributes:

    `is_axis` (Boolean)
        Indicates whether the space is an axis space, that is, the shape
        of the space rows differs from the shape of its base.

        prominent table.

    `is_contracting` (Boolean)
        Indicates if the space contracts its base space.

    `is_expanding` (Boolean)
        Indicates if the space expands its base space.

    Other attributes:

        and all its prefixes are axis spaces.

    Represents a code expression.

    A code expression is a function on spaces.  Specifically, it is a
    functional (possibly of several variables) that maps a space
    (or a Cartesian product of several spaces) to some scalar domain.
    :class:`Code` is an abstract base class for all code expressions;
    see its subclasses for concrete types of expressions.

    Among all code expressions, we distinguish *unit expressions*:
    elementary functions on spaces.  There are several kinds of units:
    among them are columns and aggregate functions (see :class:`Unit`
    for more detail).  A non-unit code could be expressed as
    a composition of a scalar function and one or several units:

        `f = F(u(a),v(b),...)`,

    where

    - `f` is a code expression;
    - `F` is a scalar function;
    - `a`, `b`, ... are elements of spaces `A`, `B`, ...;
    - `u`, `v`, ... are unit expressions on `A`, `B`, ....

    Note: special forms like `COUNT` or `EXISTS` are also expressed

class Unit(Code):
    """
    Represents a unit expression.

    A unit is an elementary function on a space.  There are several kinds
    of units; see subclasses :class:`ColumnUnit`, :class:`ScalarUnit`,
    :class:`AggregateUnit`, and :class:`CorrelatedUnit` for more detail.

    Units are divided into two categories: *primitive* and *compound*.

    A primitive unit is an intrinsic function of its space; no additional
    calculations are required to generate a primitive unit.  Currently,
    the only example of a primitive unit is :class:`ColumnUnit`.

    A compound unit requires calculating some non-intrinsic function
    on the target space.  There are three types of compound units:
    :class:`ScalarUnit`, :class:`AggregateUnit` and :class:`CorrelatedUnit`.
    They correspond respectively to a scalar function and two kinds of
    an aggregate function.

    Note that it is easy to *lift* a unit code from one space to another.
    Specifically, suppose a unit `u` is defined on a space `A` and `B`
    is another space such that `B` spans `A`.  Then for each row `b`
    from `B` there is no more than one row `a` from `A` such that `a <-> b`.
    Therefore we could define `u` on `B` as follows:

    - `u(b) = u(a)` if there exists `a` from `A` such that `a <-> b`;
    - `u(b) =` ``NULL`` if there is no rows in `A` convergent to `b`.

    When a space `B` spans the space `A` of a unit `u`, we say that
    `u` is *singular* on `B`.  By the previous argument, `u` could be
    lifted to `B`.  Thus any unit is well-defined not only on the
    space where it is originally defined, but also on any space where
    it is singular.

    Attributes:

    `space` (:class:`Space`)
        The space on which the unit is defined.

    `domain` (:class:`htsql.domain.Domain`)
        The unit co-domain.

    Class attributes:

    `is_primitive` (Boolean)
        If set, indicates that the unit is primitive.

    `is_compound` (Boolean)
        If set, indicates that the unit is compound.
