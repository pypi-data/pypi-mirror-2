Description: 
        pycerberus is a framework to check user data thoroughly so that you can protect
        your application from malicious (or just garbled) input data.
        
        * Remove stupid code which converts input values: After values are validated, you 
          can work with real Python types instead of strings - e.g. 42 instead of '42', 
          convert database IDs to model objects transparently.
        * Implement custom validation rules: Writing custom validators is 
          straightforward, everything is well documented and pycerberus only uses very 
          little Python magic.
        * Focus on your value-adding application code: Save time by implementing every 
          input validation rule only once, but 100% right instead of implementing a 
          dozen different half-baked solutions.
        * Ready for global business: i18n support (based on GNU gettext) is built in, 
          adding custom translations is easy.
        * Tune it for your needs: You can implement custom behavior in your validators,
          e.g. fetch translations from a database instead of using gettext or define
          custom translations for built-in validators.
        * Use it wherever you like: pycerberus is used in a SMTP server, trac macros as 
          well as web applications - there are no dependencies on a specific context 
          like web development.
        
        
        Changelog
        ******************************
        
        0.4 (to be released)
        ====================
        - Python 3 support
        - Fix installation/egg generation without babel
        - Added a schema which can parse positional parameters from a string into a 
          dict before processing the data like a normal schema would do
        
        0.3.3 (04.07.2010)
        ==================
        - Fix installation issue: pycerberus is actually not zip-safe
        
        0.3.2 (05.06.2010)
        ==================
        - Fix egg file generation: Include all necessary packages in eggs
        - added babel support to setup.py
        - updated pot file and completed German translation
        - fix exception if translations for preferred locale are not available (fall 
          back to english messages)
        
        0.3.1 (07.04.2010)
        ==================
        - Fixed bug due to duplicated message in DomainNameValidator/EmailAddressValidator
        - Validator can now strip inputs (False by default)
        - StringValidator now also treats '' as empty value (as well as None)
        
        0.3 (27.03.2010)
        ==================
        - Python 2.3 compatibility
        - Schema can raise error if unknown items are processed
        - Basic domain name validator
        - Basic email address validator
        
        0.2 (16.03.2010)
        ==================
        - You now can declare custom messages as a class-level dict
        - Added interface to retrieve error details from InvalidDataErrors
        - Added validation schemas to validate a set of values (typically a web form).
          Schemas can also inherit from other schemas to avoid code duplication.
        - Validators try to make thread-safety violations obvious
        - Nicer API to retrieve error details from an InvalidDataError
        
        0.1 (30.01.2010)
