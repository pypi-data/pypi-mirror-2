        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a very thin utility wrapper around the `paypal-python`_
        package. Installing this into a plone site will provide a utility with the
        interface IPaypalAPIUtility. It will also provide some configuration settings
        useful for getting started. The utility may be used in 'sandbox' mode or in
        'production' based on the settings chosen. The default is to operate in
        'sandbox' mode.
        
        Users are encouraged to read carefully the documentation for the `Paypal
        Website Payments Pro API`_

        Work In Progress
        ================
        
        This package is an early alpha. It is not yet suitable for production and is
        in no way stable. If you have contributions, please be sure to write tests to
        cover them.
