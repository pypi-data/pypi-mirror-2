        - FIX: weights in the profile were ignored.
        - development status update
        - cleaner test

        - added incremental improving of characters.
        - renamed the private function names to make them somewhat sane: _cost2bonus = cost to bonus.

        - Added basic special abilities.
        - generates the changelog from hg log.
        - added setup.py for installing and distribution.

        - moved _base and char into package rpg1d6

        - recursive skill bases works.
        - FIX: Tried to get an attribute of None.
        - wound threshold is a property.
        - shorter line
        - replace attributes with atts everywhere
        - catch errors where a skill takes itself as base or the base takes is subskill as base.
        - correctly calculate the value of specializations (_skillvaluefrom)
        - Calculace skill bonus correctly from att.bonus and M-q for docstrings.
        - value, rawvalue and bonus are now properties, calculated from cost when needed.
        - cleanly implemented reading a char from a minimal datafile.
        - started a clean implementation of 1d6 characters.
        - basic notes done.
        - _base: added the basic information.
