        Changes:
        
        
        d6 tip
        
        - Added signature for changeset f86c34cd0455
        - Added tag 0.2 for changeset 40987bd3fd67
        
        d6 0.2
        
        - reduced the size to 60x30, so it runs on simple terminals.
        - shuffle the fighters before action: Fairness.
        - FIX: it stopped at 1 or not at all
        - leave it running for 10 frames after the end.
        - no more flickering
        - the armored ones don’t win all the time anymore.c
        - interesting battles: exp 6, 3, 1.
        - active battle: swordmasters 17 skill, armored 14 armor, killers 16 weapon.
        - more room for fighting (visually) and exp for winning without wound again.
        - random groups again
        - killer against armored is about equal, too
        - now it’s about equal…
        - armored and swordmasters equal: can’t harm each other except for crits.
        - FIX: Breakage and infinite loop when using floats for experience (sub 1).
        - stronger swordmasters.
        - FIX: attvalue2cost was not used. Also added faster implementation of attvalue2cost
        - added mean powerstats.
        - charbase: more efficient version of bonus2cost().
        - more experience!
        - termctl addition of light colors.
        - slightly faster still by avoiding the passing of a fat object.
        - asciibattle: performance optimizations and a counter :)
        - added a safe (deepcopy) yaml loader cache for faster loading of many similar characters.
        - asciibattle basically works.
        - added simple termctl script, borrowed from evolve-keybourd-layout: http://bitbucket.org/ArneBab/evolve-keyboard-layout/
        - better readable attack function.
        - better readable return statement.
        - minor comments.
        - Characters can now attack each other and get wounds and damage.
        - characters can now compete against each other.
        - improve now only shows stats which actually changed instead of showing all stats which were given marks.
        - char.improve() belongs to char.py: It is something another programmer may want to use.
        - factored the basic character stuff out into charbase.py, so char.py shows more directly what you can do.
        - more package import stuff.
        - next version will be 0.2
        - Added signature for changeset 0a2f373d47c5
        - Added tag 0.1 for changeset c112b93bbace
