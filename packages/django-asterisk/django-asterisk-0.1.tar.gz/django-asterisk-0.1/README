    AST_HOST = 'localhost'
    AST_USER = 'django'
    AST_PASS = 'mysecret'
    AST_PRIO = 1
    AST_TIMEOUT_ORIGINATE = 30 # sec

Requirements

* pyst (http://pyst.sf.net/)

* a working Asterisk server (see docs/asterisk for a sample config)


=====
Usage
=====

Supposing you have an object called 'user' with the 'phone_number' attribute, you can create and queue a call like this::

    from django_asterisk.models import Call
    channel = 'SIP/%s@mysipprovider' % user.phone_number
    call = Call(channel=channel, extension=user.phone_number, context='django-out', caller_id='"Django Asterisk Test" <0123456789>', related_object=user)
    call.save()

You can later make the call from the admin, by selecting it and executing the "Make call" action.
