Pyfft is a module containing Apple's FFT implementation ported for PyCuda and PyOpenCL.
Documentation can be found in test/test_doc.py (or, in rendered form, on
`project's PyPi page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfft>`_).

Module will work even if only one of PyCuda and PyOpenCL is present; that's why they are not
added to dependencies, and it is your responsibility to install the module you need.
