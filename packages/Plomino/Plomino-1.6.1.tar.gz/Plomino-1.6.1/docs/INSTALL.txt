Plomino Installation
--------------------

* Add ``Plomino`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Plomino
       
and re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.

For that, move (or symlink) the ``CMFPlomino`` folder of this project
(``Plomino/Products/CMFPlomino``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.
