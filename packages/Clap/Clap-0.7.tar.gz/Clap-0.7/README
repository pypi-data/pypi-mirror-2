Clap
====
Clap is a library that makes it easy to write powerful, flexible command-line
applications in Python. It is inspired by Denis Defreyne's Cri.

The docs are in the ``docs`` directory. You can build them with Sphinx.

The library does not currently have unit tests, due to the difficulty in
testing libraries that work primarily over streams. However, there are a
few example scripts in the ``extra`` folder.
