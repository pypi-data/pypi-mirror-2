Description: NowSync
        =======
        
        NowSync is a set of tool for synchronizing local modification to remote
        WSGI server, makes life of designer easier.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        There is two part of NowSync, one is the server, it runs your WSGI application
        and its own WSGI application for file synchronizing.  And the other part of
        NowSync is the client, it monitors changes in local folders, if those files
        are changed, it will upload those modifications to remote server.
        
        Which means, the designer doesn't have to run a local application, all they 
        have to do is get a copy of the application in his local computer, and run 
        the NowSync client.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install NowSync, type::
        
           easy_install nowsync
           
        Or, if you perfer pip::
        
           pip install nowsync
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        To run NowSync, you need to write a configuration file, it will be read both
        by the client and server, it is in YAML format, here is an example::
        
            ---
            
            # show we turn on the debug mode of NowSync server?
            debug: True
            
            # NowSync server
            nowsync:
                interface: 0.0.0.0
                port: 5001
                # can be accessed by users only
                user_only: True
                # are we under a proxy?
                under_proxy: True
               
            # guest WSGI app server to run
            app:
                interface: 0.0.0.0
                port: 5000
                user_only: True
                under_proxy: True
                # the path of WSGI application to run
                # wsgi here is the module, and application is the variable name in
                # the module
                app_path: wsgi:application
            
            client:
                # url to NowSync API
                url: http://develop.example.com:5001/api/
                
                # user name
                username: alvin
                password: password_goes_here
            
            # path to directory to sync
            sync_path: .
            
            # files that we want to sync
            sync_files: [
                'myproject/static/**',
                'myproject/templates/**',
            ]
            
            # files that we don't want to sync
            ignore_files: [
                '*.pyc',
                '.hg/*',
                '.git/*',
                '.*',
                'nowsync.yaml',
            ]
            
            # users who can access to NowSync server or guest application
            users:
                alvin: password_goes_here
            
            ...
             
        Put the configuration file nowsync.yaml in the folder of your project.  The
        structure may look like this::
        
           myproject/
               + wsgi.py
               + nowsync.yaml
               + setup.py
               + myproject/
                   + static/
                   + templates/
                   + models/
                   + views/
                   
        How to use
        ----------
                   
        To run nowsync server, here you type::
        
           nowsync_server
           
        And you should see::
        
           running nowsync_server
           INFO:nowsync.server:Start new process
           INFO:werkzeug: * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
            * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
            
        With proper configuration in project folder, all designer has to do is get a
        copy of your project, and run::
        
           cd myproject
           nowsync_client
           
        For now, it synchronizes files in myproject, your designer just modify the
        template, CSS and images,  and all the modifications will reflect in the 
        remote WSGI server.
