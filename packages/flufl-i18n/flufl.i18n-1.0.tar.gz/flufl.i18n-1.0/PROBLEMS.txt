* test w/2to3 conversion fails if test is run with python 2 first
* build_sphinx command needs to accept -c option for conf.py
* globbing toctrees with absolute paths
* double colons needed when blank lines exist in code blocks or you get bogus
  indentations
* Get __version__ from package in conf.py file.
* upload_docs default directory should be sphinx default build directory
* if README.html is your master_doc, upload_docs fails because there's no
  index.html.  why not create/symlink one?
* pypi.python.org/<package> should auto-link to packages.python.org/<package>
