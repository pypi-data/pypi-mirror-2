Description: ======================================================
        flufl.i18n - A high level API for internationalization
        ======================================================
        
        This package provides a high level, convenient API for managing
        internationalization translation contexts in Python application.  There is a
        simple API for single-context applications, such as command line scripts which
        only need to translate into one language during the entire course of their
        execution.  There is a more flexible, but still convenient API for
        multi-context applications, such as servers, which may need to switch language
        contexts for different tasks.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        ``flufl.i18n`` requires Python 2.6.5 or newer, and is compatible with Python 3
        when used with ``2to3``.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        A `simple guide`_ to using the library is available both within this package,
        in the form of doctests.  The manual is also available online in the
        Cheeseshop at:
        
            http://packages.python.org/flufl.i18n

        You can download the latest version of the package either from the Cheeseshop:
        
            http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flufl.i18n
            
        or from the Launchpad page above.  Of course you can also just install it with
        ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` from the command line::
        
            % sudo pip flufl.i18n
            % sudo easy_install flufl.i18n
        
        You can grab the latest development copy of the code using Bazaar, from the
        Launchpad home page above.  See http://bazaar-vcs.org for details on the
        Bazaar distributed revision control system.  If you have Bazaar installed, you
        can branch the code like this::
        
             % bzr branch lp:flufl.i18n

        NEWS for flufl.i18n
        =====================
        
        1.0 (2010-04-24)
        ================
        
         * Use Distribute instead of Setuptools.
         * Port to Python 3 when used with 2to3.
         * More documentation improvements.
        
        
        0.6 (2010-04-21)
        ================
        
         * Documentation and lint clean up.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-04-20)
        ================
        
         * Added a simplified initialization API for one-language-context
           applications. This works much better for non-server applications.
         * Added a SimpleStrategy which recognizes the $LOCPATH environment variable.
         * Show how PEP 292 strings are supported automatically.
         * When strategies are called with zero arguments, they supply the default
           translation context, which is usually a NullTranslation.  This is better
           than hardcoding the NullTranslation in the Application.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-03-04)
        ================
        
         * Add the ability to get the current language code, via _.code
        
        
        0.3 (2009-11-15)
        ================
        
         * Initial release; refactored from Mailman 3.
