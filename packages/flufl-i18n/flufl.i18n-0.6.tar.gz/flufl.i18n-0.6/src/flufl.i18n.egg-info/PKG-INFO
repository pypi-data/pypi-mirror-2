        **********
        
        The `flufl.i18n` library provides a convenient API for managing translation
        contexts in Python application.  It provides facilities not only for
        single-context applications like command line scripts, but also more
        sophisticated management of multiple-context applications such as Internet
        servers.

        NEWS for flufl.i18n
        =====================
        
        0.6 (2010-04-21)
        ================
        
         * Documentation and lint clean up.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-04-20)
        ================
        
         * Added a simplified initialization API for one-language-context
           applications. This works much better for non-server applications.
         * Added a SimpleStrategy which recognizes the $LOCPATH environment variable.
         * Show how PEP 292 strings are supported automatically.
         * When strategies are called with zero arguments, they supply the default
           translation context, which is usually a NullTranslation.  This is better
           than hardcoding the NullTranslation in the Application.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-03-04)
        ================
        
         * Add the ability to get the current language code, via _.code
        
        
        0.3 (2009-11-15)
        ================
        
         * Initial release; refactored from Mailman 3.
