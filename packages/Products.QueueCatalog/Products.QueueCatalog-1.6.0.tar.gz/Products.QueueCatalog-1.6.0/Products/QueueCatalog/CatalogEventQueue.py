    """Event queue for catalog events

    This is a rather odd queue. It organizes events by object, where
    objects are identified by uids, which happen to be string paths.

    One way that this queue is extremely odd is that it really only
    keeps track of the last event for an object. This is because we
    really only *care* about the last event for an object.

    There are three types of events:

    ADDED         -- An object was added to the catalog

    CHANGED       -- An object was changed

    REMOVED       -- An object was removed from the catalog

    CHANGED_ADDED -- Add object was added and subsequently changed.
                     This event is a consequence of the queue implementation.
                     
    Note that, although we only keep track of the most recent
    event. there are rules for how the most recent event can be
    updated:

    - It is illegal to update an ADDED, CHANGED, or CHANGED_ADDED
      event with an ADDED event or

    - to update a REMOVED event with a CHANGED event.

    We have a problem because applications don't really indicate
    whether they are are adding, or just updating.  We deduce add
    events by examining the catalog and event queue states.

    Also note that, when events are applied to the catalog, events may
    have no effect.

    - If an object is in the catalog, ADDED events are equivalent to
      CHANGED events.

    - If an object is not in the catalog, REMOVED and CHANGED events
      have no effect.

    If we undo a transaction, we generate an anti-event. The anti
    event of ADDED id REMOVED, of REMOVED is ADDED, and of CHANGED is
    CHANGED. 

    Note that these rules represent heuristics that attempt to provide
    efficient and sensible behavior for most cases. They are not "correct" in
    that they handle cases that may not seem handleable. For example,
    consider a sequence of transactions:

      T1 adds an object
      T2 removes the object
      T3 adds the object
      T4 processes the queue
      T5 undoes T1

    It's not clear what should be done in this case? We decide to
    generate a remove event, even though a later transaction added the
    object again. Is this correct? It's hard to say. The decision we
    make is not horrible and it allows us to provide a very efficient
    implementation.  See the unit tests for other scenarios. Feel
    free to think of cases for which our decisions are unacceptably
    wrong and write unit tests for these cases.

    There are two kinds of transactions that affect the queue:

    - Application transactions always add or modify events. They never
      remove events.

    - Queue processing transactions always remove events.
