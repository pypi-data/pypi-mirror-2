QueueCatalog Product Changelog

  QueueCatalog 1.5 (2007/12/15)
   
    - Replaced validateValue call with proper validate call. This
      makes QueueCatalog compatible with Zope 2.9 

  QueueCatalog 1.4 (2006/05/09)

    - Added a second catalog queue conflict resolution strategy and made
      the strategy configurable via the 'Configure' ZMI tab. The new policy
      can be tried when ZODB conflict errors emanating from the catalog
      queue buckets become a problem. It attempts to avoid conflicts by
      doing even more guessing about what the behavior should be, rather
      than deeming a conflicting situation as too insane to handle and 
      raising a ConflictError.

    - Removed all uses of zLOG in favor of the Python logging module

    - Updated some help screens

    - Added a dependencies document

    - Updated the tests to run on Zope 2.8+

    - Factored out queue conflict testing after changing it to use a quick 
      and dirty FileStorage, and expanding it a little.

    - Removed the security declaration for a method named refreshCatalog
      which was added in version 1.0 - this is the wrong place to apply
      product-specific settings for a product the QueueCatalog is not
      dependent on.

    - CVS-only, tag 'QueueCatalog-post-1_3-error-logging'

    - When performing deferred indexing, don't attempt (again) to
      assign brains metadata

    - When indexing an object raises an Exception, log it, and remove
      the object from the queue
