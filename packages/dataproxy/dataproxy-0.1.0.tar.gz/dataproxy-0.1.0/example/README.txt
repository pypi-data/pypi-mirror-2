There are three examples here:

``jquery/catalogue/simple.html``

    Load a page which fetches the second sheet of a UK bebefit data spreadsheet
    and inserts it as HTML.

``jquery/catalogue/index.html``

    A simple app built against the UK government's catalogue. Load
    ``index.html``, choose "Search package metadata" and try searching for
    ``gb-regional-benefit-expenditure``. If you click the link to the Excel file,
    the first sheet of the data will be shown.

``dataproxy``

    An example Google App Engine app for setting up your own proxy. NB: If you
    set up your own app engine example you may want to copy the ``app.py`` in the
    ``dataproxy`` directory from the (possibly) more recent version in the
    ``jsonpdataproxy`` directory.
