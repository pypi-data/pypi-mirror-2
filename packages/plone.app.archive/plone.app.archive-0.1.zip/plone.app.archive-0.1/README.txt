Overview
========

This package aims to provide a simple content archiving solution. Content
is archived in a opaque archive outside of the normal content structure.

The content is deleted from it's original location and thus completely removed
from the site catalogs. Restoration returns the object to it's original parent.

This package is in an early alpha state. Archiving and restoring works, but
there are is as yet no end-user UI to use it.
