Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package aims to provide a simple content archiving solution. Content
        is archived in a opaque archive outside of the normal content structure.
        
        The content is deleted from it's original location and thus completely removed
        from the site catalogs. Restoration returns the object to it's original parent.
        
        This package is in an early alpha state. Archiving and restoring works, but
        there are is as yet no end-user UI to use it.
