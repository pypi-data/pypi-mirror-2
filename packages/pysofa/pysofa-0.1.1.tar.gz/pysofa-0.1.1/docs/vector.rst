Vector/Matrix/Angle functions
=============================

.. include:: common.inc

.. note::
    These functions deal with vector and matrices manipulations by |SOFA|.
    Most of them can be implemented by the user in a perhaps more
    straightforward and fastest way by directly using :mod:`math` or
    :mod:`numpy` methods, but they are however implemented and listed here
    for completeness.
