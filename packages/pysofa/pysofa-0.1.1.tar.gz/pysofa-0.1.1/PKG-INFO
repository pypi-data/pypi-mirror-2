Description: *pysofa* is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ module for
        accessing `International Astronomical Union <http://www.iau.org/>`_'s
        `SOFA library <http://www.iausofa.org/>`_ from python. SOFA (Standards
        of Fundamental Astronomy) is a set of algorithms and procedures that
        implement standard models used in fundamental astronomy.
        
        *pysofa* is not a port of SOFA routines but a wrapper around the SOFA_C
        library. Thus, no calculations are made into the pysofa software, they are
        all delegated to the underlying SOFA_C library.
        
        *pysofa* is neither distributed, supported nor endorsed by the International
        Astronomical Union. In addition to *pysofa*'s license, any use of this module
        should comply with `SOFA's license and terms of use
        <http://www.iausofa.org/copyr.pdf>`_. Especially, but not exclusively, any
        published work or commercial products which includes results achieved by using
        *pysofa* shall acknowledge that the SOFA software was used in obtaining those
        results.
