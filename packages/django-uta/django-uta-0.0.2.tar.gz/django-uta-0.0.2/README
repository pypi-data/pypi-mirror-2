The idea is simple.
When you have a template wich is of known type you render it correctly.
Currently Jinja2, Mako and HamlPy are recognized by extensions respectively:
 - .jinja2.html
 - .mako.html
 - .hamlpy
That said, if you have few apps using different templates in one project or want to use specific templates in part of project, it can be achieved easily.

To use this simply install required templates libraries and add 'uta' to INSTALLED_APPS.
