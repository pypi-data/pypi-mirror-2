Eztv

What is eztv?
=============

  Eztv is a small package to parse the eztv.it homepage, the site has releases
  for most popular Television Shows.

  With this package you can:

    - Get all current released shows.
    - Date released on the site.
    - All torrent / magnet links for the downloads.

  Working example(s) is provided in the examples/ directory.

Launchpad
=========

  Eztv is hosted at http://www.launchpad.net, so if you are interested
  at using the cutting edge revisions or possibly interested in getting
  involved and submit patches it is where to turn.

  Also all bugs are handled through it, so if you are to report a bug
  do it through launchpad.

  The project is located at http://launchpad.net/pyeztv.

Documentation
=============

  The documentation can be generated with epydoc, either manually or by
  using the config file provided(.epyconfig) which is what I recommend.

  Generating it is as simple as:
    epydoc --config .epyconfig

  Then it'll be under the docs/ directory.
