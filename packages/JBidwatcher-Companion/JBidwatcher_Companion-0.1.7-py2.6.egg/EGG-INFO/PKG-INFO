Description: A command line program (``ebstat.py``) that creates price vs. time graphs for
        completed auctions on Ebay. It is intended for use in conjunction with the Ebay
        bidding program JBidwatcher. 
        
        An image of a time vs. price graph can be seen on the documentation website:
        
            http://packages.python.org/JBidwatcher-Companion/
        
        **JBidwatcher** is available from: 
        
            http://www.jbidwatcher.com
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This program is written in the **Python** programming language, and needs a
        Python interpreter to run. (Only tested on **Python version 2.6**)
        Additionally the program uses the following Python libraries: 
        
            - **Numpy** for numerical computations (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
            - **Matplotlib** for the graph window (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
        
        **Windows** users should install **Python XY**, a (giant) Python distribution 
        for scientists. This is the most easy way for them to install all dependencies 
        at once.
        
            http://www.pythonxy.com/
            
        **Linux** users need to use their distribution's installation program(s) to
        install the dependencies. *Numpy* and *Matplotlib* are packaged for most 
        Linux distributions.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        JBidwatcher-Companion can be installed with the program **easy_install**,
        which downloads the necessary package from the Python Package Index
        (http://pypi.python.org/pypi), and installs it.   
        
        Get administrative privileges, then open a **shell window** / **DOS box** 
        and type: ::
        
            easy_install jbidwatcher-companion
        
            
        Usage
        -----
        
        To get help on the available options, type: ::
        
            ebstat.py -h
            
        List the tabs in JBidwatcher's database: ::
        
            ebstat.py ls
            
        Create a graph of the (finished) auctions in the tab `Nikon SB`, the moving 
        median is computed over 40 days: ::
        
            ebstat.py gr -t "Nikon SB" -w 40
        
        The usage of the interactive graph window is mostly self explanatory. Some 
        features however can't be discovered through the GUI. The most important
        features are: 
        
        * Clicking on an auction shows information about this auction in the bottom 
          right of the window. 
        * Double clicking an auction runs an external program, which can be 
          configured. By default the auction is shown in Firefox.
        * The buttons at the bottom of the window can be used to pan, zoom, and 
          save an image of the graph.
        * Pressing the 'g' key switches a grid on and off.
