Description: A command line program (`ebstat.py`) that creates price vs. time graphs for
        completed auctions on Ebay. It is intended for use in conjunction with the Ebay
        bidding program JBidwatcher. 
        
        The time vs. price graphs look like this:
        
            http://packages.python.org/JBidwatcher-Companion/Nikon-SB.png
        
        **JBidwatcher** is available from: 
        
            http://www.jbidwatcher.com
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This program is written in the **Python** programming language, and needs a
        Python interpreter to run. (Only tested on **Python version 2.6**)
        Additionally the program uses the following Python libraries: 
        
            - **Numpy** for numerical computations (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
            - **Matplotlib** for the graph window (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
        
        **Windows** users should install **Python XY**, a (giant) Python distribution 
        for scientists. This is the most easy way for them to install all dependencies 
        at once.
        
            http://www.pythonxy.com/
            
        **Linux** users need to use their distribution's installation program(s) to
        install the dependencies. *Numpy* and *Matplotlib* are packaged for most 
        Linux distributions.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        JBidwatcher-Companion can be installed with the program **easy_install**,
        which downloads the necessary package from the Pyhon Package Index
        (http://pypi.python.org/pypi), and installs it.   
        
        Get administrative priviliges, then open a **shell window** / **DOS box** 
        and type: ::
        
            easy_install jbidwatcher-companion
        
            
        Usage
        -----
        
        To get help on the available options, type: ::
        
            ebstat.py -h
            
        List the tabs in JBidwatcher's database: ::
        
            ebstat.py ls
            
        Create a graph of the (finished) auctions in the tab `Nikon SB`, the moving 
        median is computed over 40 days: ::
        
            ebstat.py gr -t "Nikon SB" -w 40
        
        The usage of the interactive graph window is mostly self explanatory, the 
        main features are: 
        
        * Clicking on an auction shows information about this auction in the bottom 
          right of the window. 
        * The buttons at the bottom of the window can be used to pan, zoom, and 
          save an image of the graph.
        * Pressing the 'g' key switches a grid on and off.
