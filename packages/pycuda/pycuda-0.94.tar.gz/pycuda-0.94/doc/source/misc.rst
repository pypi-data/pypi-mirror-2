User-visible Changes
====================

Version 0.94
------------
.. note::

    Version 0.94 is the current development version. You can get it from
    PyCUDA's version control repository.

* Support for CUDA 3.0. (but not CUDA 3.0 beta!)
  Search for "CUDA 3.0" in :ref:`reference-doc` to see what's new.
* Support for CUDA 3.1 beta.
  Search for "CUDA 3.1" in :ref:`reference-doc` to see what's new.
* Support for CUDA 3.2 RC.
  Search for "CUDA 3.2" in :ref:`reference-doc` to see what's new.
* Add sparse matrix-vector multiplication and linear system solving code,
  in :mod:`pycuda.sparse`.
* Add :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.if_positive`, :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.maximum`,
  :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.minimum`.
* Deprecate :func:`pycuda.tools.get_default_device` 
* Add :func:`pycuda.tools.make_default_context`.
* Use :func:`pycuda.tools.make_default_context` in :mod:`pycuda.autoinit`,
  which changes its behavior.
* Remove previously deprecated features:

  * :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.registers`, 
    :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.lmem`, and
    :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.smem` have been deprecated in favor of the
    mechanism above. See :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.num_regs` for more.
  * the three-argument forms (i.e. with streams)
    of :func:`pycuda.driver.memcpy_dtoh` and
    :func:`pycuda.driver.memcpy_htod`. Use 
    :func:`pycuda.driver.memcpy_dtoh_async`
    and :func:`pycuda.driver.memcpy_htod_async` instead.
  * :class:`pycuda.driver.SourceModule`.

* Add :func:`pycuda.tools.context_dependent_memoize`, use it for
  context-dependent caching of PyCUDA's canned kernels.
* Add :func:`pycuda.tools.mark_cuda_test`.
* Add attributes of :exc:`pycuda.driver.CompileError`.
  (requested by Dan Lepage)
* Add preliminary support for complex numbers.
  (initial discussion with Daniel Fan)
* Add 
  :attr:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray.real`,
  :attr:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray.imag`,
  :meth:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray.conj`.
* Add :class:`pycuda.driver.PointerHolderBase`.

Version 0.93
------------

.. warning::

    Version 0.93 makes some changes to the PyCUDA programming interface.
    In all cases where documented features were changed, the old usage
    continues to work, but results in a warning. It is recommended that
    you update your code to remove the warning.

* OpenGL interoperability in :mod:`pycuda.gl`.
* Document :meth:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray.__len__`. Change its definition
  to match :mod:`numpy`.
* Add :meth:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray.bind_to_texref_ext`.
* Let :class:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray` operators deal with generic
  data types, including type promotion.
* Add :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.take`.
* Fix thread handling by making internal context stack thread-local.
* Add :class:`pycuda.reduction.ReductionKernel`.
* Add :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.sum`, :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.dot`, 
  :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.subset_dot`.
* Synchronous and asynchronous memory transfers are now separate
  from each other, the latter having an ``_async`` suffix.
  The now-synchronous forms still take a :class:`pycuda.driver.Stream`
  argument, but this practice is deprecated and prints a warning.
* :class:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray` no longer has an associated 
  :class:`pycuda.driver.Stream`.  Asynchronous GPUArray transfers are 
  now separate from synchronous ones and have an ``_async`` suffix.
* Support for features added in CUDA 2.2.
* :class:`pycuda.driver.SourceModule` has been moved to
  :class:`pycuda.compiler.SourceModule`. It is still available by
  the old name, but will print a warning about the impending
  deprecation.
* :meth:`pycuda.driver.Device.get_attribute` with a 
  :class:`pycuda.driver.device_attribute` `attr` can now be spelled
  `dev.attr`, with no further namespace detours. (Suggested by Ian Cullinan)
  Likewise for :meth:`pycuda.driver.Function.get_attribute`
* :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.registers`, 
  :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.lmem`, and
  :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.smem` have been deprecated in favor of the
  mechanism above. See :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.num_regs` for more.
* Add PyCUDA version query mechanism, see :data:`pycuda.VERSION`.

Version 0.92
------------

.. note::

    If you're upgrading from prior versions, 
    you may delete the directory :file:`$HOME/.pycuda-compiler-cache`
    to recover now-unused disk space.

.. note::

    During this release time frame, I had the honor of giving a talk on PyCUDA
    for a `class <http://sites.google.com/site/cudaiap2009/>`_ that a group around 
    Nicolas Pinto was teaching at MIT.
    If you're interested, the slides for it are 
    `available <http://mathema.tician.de/dl/pub/pycuda-mit.pdf>`_.

* Make :class:`pycuda.tools.DeviceMemoryPool` official functionality,
  after numerous improvements. Add :class:`pycuda.tools.PageLockedMemoryPool`
  for pagelocked memory, too.
* Properly deal with automatic cleanup in the face of several contexts.
* Fix compilation on Python 2.4.
* Fix 3D arrays. (Nicolas Pinto)
* Improve error message when :command:`nvcc` is not found.
* Automatically run Python GC before throwing out-of-memory errors.
* Allow explicit release of memory using 
  :meth:`pycuda.driver.DeviceAllocation.free`,
  :meth:`pycuda.driver.HostAllocation.free`,
  :meth:`pycuda.driver.Array.free`,
  :meth:`pycuda.tools.PooledDeviceAllocation.free`,
  :meth:`pycuda.tools.PooledHostAllocation.free`.
* Make configure switch ``./configure.py --cuda-trace`` to enable API tracing.
* Add a documentation chapter and examples on :ref:`metaprog`.
* Add :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.empty_like` and 
  :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.zeros_like`.
* Add and document :attr:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray.mem_size` in anticipation of
  stride/pitch support in :class:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray`.
* Merge Jozef Vesely's MD5-based RNG.
* Document :func:`pycuda.driver.from_device` 
  and :func:`pycuda.driver.from_device_like`.
* Add :class:`pycuda.elementwise.ElementwiseKernel`.
* Various documentation improvements. (many of them from Nicholas Tung)
* Move PyCUDA's compiler cache to the system temporary directory, rather
  than the users home directory.

Version 0.91
------------

* Add support for compiling on CUDA 1.1. 
  Added version query :func:`pycuda.driver.get_version`.
  Updated documentation to show 2.0-only functionality.
* Support for Windows and MacOS X, in addition to Linux. 
  (Gert Wohlgemuth, Cosmin Stejerean, Znah on the Nvidia forums,
  and David Gadling)
* Support more arithmetic operators on :class:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray`. (Gert Wohlgemuth)
* Add :func:`pycuda.gpuarray.arange`. (Gert Wohlgemuth)
* Add :mod:`pycuda.curandom`. (Gert Wohlgemuth)
* Add :mod:`pycuda.cumath`. (Gert Wohlgemuth)
* Add :mod:`pycuda.autoinit`.
* Add :mod:`pycuda.tools`.
* Add :class:`pycuda.tools.DeviceData` and :class:`pycuda.tools.OccupancyRecord`.
* :class:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray` parallelizes properly on 
  GTX200-generation devices.
* Make :class:`pycuda.driver.Function` resource usage available
  to the program. (See, e.g. :attr:`pycuda.driver.Function.registers`.)
* Cache kernels compiled by :class:`pycuda.compiler.SourceModule`.
  (Tom Annau)
* Allow for faster, prepared kernel invocation. 
  See :meth:`pycuda.driver.Function.prepare`. 
* Added memory pools, at :class:`pycuda.tools.DeviceMemoryPool` as
  experimental, undocumented functionality.
  For some workloads, this can cure the slowness of 
  :func:`pycuda.driver.mem_alloc`.
* Fix the :ref:`memset <memset>` family of functions.
* Improve :ref:`errors`.
* Add `order` parameter to :func:`pycuda.driver.matrix_to_array` and
  :func:`pycuda.driver.make_multichannel_2d_array`.

Acknowledgments
================

* Gert Wohlgemuth ported PyCUDA to MacOS X and contributed large parts of
  :class:`pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray`.
