# Overview #

globy is a Python library wrapping parts of the Globus Toolkit. It is
intentionally written by hand and not with SWIG, to make it easy to develop and
audit the specific functionality required by Globus Online.

glopy is pronounced **jalopy**, *NOT gloppy*. It is short for GLObus PYthon.

# Usage #

See [http://globusonline.github.com/glopy/](http://globusonline.github.com/glopy/) for the generated API documentation.

Currently only supports loading and verifying certificate chains and
credentials, by wrapping globus_gsi_credential. For example:

    import glopy

    c = glopy.Credential()
    c.load_cert_file("/tmp/x509up_u1000")
    print "identity =", c.get_identity()
    print "subject =", c.get_subject()
    print "goodtill =", c.get_goodtill()
    try:
        c.verify_chain()
    except glopy.error as e:
        print "Verify Failed:", str(e)
    else:
        print "Verify OK"

It works even when no private key is present (a certificate chain), and
it understands proxy certificates.

A single credential object can be re-used to load and verify many certificates
and proxies, from files and from strings, within a single thread. However it is
**NOT THREAD SAFE**, so each thread should have it's own object.

# Building #

Globus Toolkit 5.0 or 5.2 (5.1.X) is required.

The build script uses vanilla distutils. To build and install, run this
(probably as root):

    export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus GLOBUS_FLAVOR=gcc64dbg
    python setup.py install

For GT 5.2, set your environment like this:

    GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr
    GLOBUS_FLAVOR=

If using the debian packages for 5.2, install:

    apt-get install libglobus-gss-assist-dev libglobus-gsi-credential-dev

this list may not be complete - try installing this as well if that fails:

    apt-get install globus-gsi-cert-utils-progs globus-proxy-util

For GT 5.0, set `GLOBUS_LOCATION` and `GLOBUS_FLAVOR` to the values used when
you installed globus toolkit.

Note: There are currently lots of warnings from gt header files. It would
be nice to fix these, I may be including a header twice.
