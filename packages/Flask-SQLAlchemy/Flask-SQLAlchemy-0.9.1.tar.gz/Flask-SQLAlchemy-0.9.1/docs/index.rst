Flask-SQLAlchemy
================

.. module:: flaskext.sqlalchemy

Flask-SQLAlchemy adds support for `SQLAlchemy`_ to your `Flask`_
application.  This module is currently still under development and the
documentation is lacking.  If you want to get started, have a look at the
`example sourcecode`_.

.. _SQLAlchemy: http://sqlalchemy.org/
.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _example sourcecode:
   http://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/tree/master/examples/

Installation
------------

Install the extension with one of the following commands::

    $ easy_install Flask-SQLAlchemy

or alternatively if you have pip installed::

    $ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy


How to Use
----------

Flask-SQLAlchemy is fun to use, and incredibly easy for basic applications.
For the complete guide, checkout out the API
documentation on the :class:`SQLAlchemy` class.

Basically all you have to do is to create an :class:`SQLAlchemy` object
and use this to declare models.  Here a complete example::

    from flask import Flask
    from flaskext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from werkzeug import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
    db = SQLAlchemy(app)


    class User(db.Model):
        __tablename__ = 'users'
        username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True)
        pw_hash = db.Column(db.String(80))

        def __init__(self, username, password):
            self.username = username
            self.set_password(password)

        def set_password(self, password):
            self.pw_hash = generate_password_hash(password)

        def check_password(self, password):
            return check_password_hash(self.pw_hash, password)

        def __repr__(self):
            return '<User %r>' % self.username

To create the initial database, just import the `db` object from a
interactive Python shell and run the :meth:`~SQLAlchemy.create_all` method
to create the tables and database:

>>> from yourapplication import db
>>> db.create_all()

Boom, and there is your database.  Now to create some users:

>>> from yourapplication import User
>>> admin = User('admin', 'open sesame')
>>> guest = User('guest', 'i-shall-pass')

But they are not yet in the database, so let's make sure they are:

>>> db.session.add(admin)
>>> db.session.add(guest)
>>> db.session.commit()

And how do you get the data back?  Easy as pie:

>>> users = User.query.all()
[<User u'admin'>, <User u'guest'>]
>>> admin = User.query.filter_by(username='admin').first()
<User u'admin'>

Road to Enlightenment
---------------------

The only things you need to know compared to plain SQLAlchemy are:

1.  :class:`SQLAlchemy` gives you access to the following things:

    -   all the functions and classes from :mod:`sqlalchemy` and
        :mod:`sqlalchemy.orm`
    -   a preconfigured scoped session called `session`
    -   the `metadata`
    -   a :meth:`SQLAlchemy.create_all` and :meth:`SQLAlchemy.drop_all`
        methods to create and drop tables according to the models.
    -   a :class:`Model` baseclass that is a configured declarative base.

2.  The :class:`Model` declarative base class behaves like a regular
    Python class but has a `query` attribute attached that can be used to
    query the model.  (:class:`Model` and :class:`BaseQuery`)

3.  You have to commit the session, but you don't have to remove it at
    the end of the request, Flask-SQLAlchemy does that for you.

4.  In general it behaves as a declarative base system, for everything
    else, just look at the SQLAlchemy documentation.

Configuration Values
--------------------

The following configuration values exist for Flask-SQLAlchemy:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{6.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|

=============================== =========================================
``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI``     The database URI that should be used for
                                the connection.  Examples:

                                - ``sqlite:////tmp/test.db``
                                - ``mysql://username:password@server/db``
``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO``             If set to `True` SQLAlchemy will log all
                                the statements issued to stderr which can
                                be useful for debugging.
``SQLALCHEMY_RECORD_QUERIES``   Can be used to explicitly disable or
                                enable query recording.  Query recording
                                automatically happens in debug or testing
                                mode.  See :func:`get_debug_queries` for
                                more information.
``SQLALCHEMY_NATIVE_UNICODE``   Can be used to explicitly disable native
                                unicode support.  This is required for
                                some database adapters like postgres when
                                used with inproper database defaults that
                                specify encoding-less databases (like
                                postgres on some Ubuntu versions)
``SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE``        The size of the database pool.  Defaults
                                to the engine's default (usually 5)
``SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT``     Specifies the connection timeout for the
                                pool.  Defaults to 10.
``SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE``     Number of seconds after which a
                                connection is automatically recycled.
                                This is required for MySQL, which removes
                                connections after 8 hours idle by
                                default.  Note that Flask-SQLAlchemy
                                automatically sets this to 2 hours if
                                MySQL is used.
