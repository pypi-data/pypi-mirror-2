Welcome to code-centered issue tracking!
==============================================

The ``ciss`` command line tool manages your ``ISSUES.txt`` file.

**Features**:

- simple extensible humand-readable text format 
- use your text editor for editing one or many issues
- use whatever version control you like. 

Checkout the :doc:`tutorial` for some basic usage examples.

ciss installs on virtually all Python interpreters
and operating systems, was written by `Holger Krekel`_ 
and is MIT licensed.

.. note::

    ciss is just starting, it's alpha software - but 
    be assured: it has more tests than code :)
