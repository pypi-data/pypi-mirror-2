        ======
        
        To make sure no bad hacker adds a comment with no authentication, you have to install a small app called django-contrib-comments-auth::
        
        	pip install django-contrib-comments-auth
        	
        Add it to the INSTALLED_APPS::
        
         	INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            'commentsauth',
        	)
        	
        Add one line to your root-urls.py::
        
        	urlpatterns = patterns('',
            # ...
            (r'^comments/', include('commentsauth.urls'),
            (r'^comments/', include('django.contrib.comments.urls'))
        	)
        	
        It must be *before* the django.contrib.comments.urls-directive and have the same prefix. That's it.
