Description: 
            A command line tool which sends AMQP messages whose body is anything
            read on stdin, and a deamon which executes a command for each message,
            which reads the message body on its stdin.
        
            There are some scripts which sign and encrypt the message using GnuPG,
            so you can use this as a mechanism for secure synchronization between
            two sites, neither of which accept incoming connections, via an
            AMQP server you don't want to trust.
            
            The idea is that you use this with a DCVS such as mercurial, passing
            changesets as messages.
