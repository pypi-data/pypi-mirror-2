Description: 
        NEO stands for Neural Ensemble Objects and is a project to provide a common set of base classes to be used
        in neural data analysis, with the aim of getting OpenElectrophy, NeuroTools and maybe other projects
        with similar goals more close together.
        
        It provide a set of basic class to manipulate electro-physiological (in vivo and/or simulated) data 
        and an IO module to read/write as many as possible file format.
