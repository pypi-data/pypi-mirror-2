Release Notes
=============

v0.14.0
-------

Added nofollow option to mark foreign keys that shouldn't be followed by the
serializer. Nofollow can be used to optimize easymodes queries when generating
xml, see :ref:`nofollow`. 

v0.13.7
-------

- Fallbacks for translatable fields now also work when the first fallback is not
  the MSGID_LANGUAGE.

v0.13.6
-------

- You can now override the model form of an admin class decorated with L10n, just
  like normal admin classes.

v0.13.5
-------

- Easymode nolonger patches SubFieldBase. Fields that throw Exceptions when their
  descriptor is accessed can now also be internationalized using I18n. This
  includes ImageField and FileField.

v0.13.4
-------

- :func:`~easymode.utils.standin.standin_for` now returns a standin that can be
  pickled and unpickled.

v0.13.3
-------

- register_all will nolonger try to register abstract models
- search_fields is now supported for ModelAdmin classes that use L10n, however it
  will not let you access related items.
- You can now use fieldsets with the *Can edit untranslated fields* permission.
- Added support for creating new objects to easypublisher.
- Added tools to build preview functionality for drafts.
- Added filter that removes unpublished items from the xml.
- fixed error 'cannot import name introspection' caused by a circular import.

v0.10.5
-------

- Added option to exclude models from register_all
- Backwards incompatible change: easymode nolonger has any bindings for 
  django-cms.
- Easymode will now show you the origin of a value, by displaying symbols next to
  the input field in the admin:
  
  1. If a value is from the gettext catalog or fallback, easymode will display **∴°**
  2. If a value is from the database, but the catalog has a different value, easymode will
     display **∴⁺** . You can hover over this symbol to see the catalog value.
  3. If a value is from the database and there is no conflict with the catalog, easymode will
     display only **∴**
- Fixed bug where a value that evaluated to *None* was set with the :class:`string` **None** instead of
  :class:`types.NoneType` :class:`None`
- fixes bug where get_localized_property would crash if settings did not have 
  FALLBACK_LANGUAGES defined.
- :class:`django.db.models.ManyToManyField` and :class:`django.db.models.ForeignKey`
  are now handled by the default xslt ('xslt/model-to-xml.xsl').

v0.9.3
------

- fixes :class:`easymode.admin.abstract.AbstractOrderedModel`
- register_all will ignore models that are :class:`django.contrib.admin.sites.AlreadyRegistered`,
  but still register other models in the module.

v0.9.2
------

- Fixed bug in recursion_depth context manager and added tests.

v0.9.1
------

- Modified the xslt parser to use the file path instead of a string, so you can 
  use xsl:include now.
- libxsltmod is nolonger a supported xslt engine
- Added util to add register all models in some module in one go.

v0.8.6
------

- Easymode will nolonger complain about rosetta, polib and tinymce when none of 
  the features that require these packages are used.
- Moved polib util to :mod:`easymode.utils.polibext` to avoid name clashes 
- :class:`~easymode.admin.models.fields.DiocoreTextField` now accepts cols and rows as parameters.
- The mechanism to add extra attributes to the xml produced by the serializer is 
  now more generic. If a field has the 'extra_attrs' property, these attributes 
  will be added as attributes to the field xml.
- Updated the serializer to support natural keys: 
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/serialization/#natural-keys 
- Now easymode can automatically serialize many to many fields. The recursion is 
  guarded, and will let you know when you made a cyclic relation in you model 
  tree. (see :ref:`recursion_limit`).
- :class:`~easymode.utils.mutex` now raises :class:`~easymode.utils.SemaphoreException` instead of doing sys.exit(). 
- When to_python returns a weird object on a field instead of a string, it is now converted to unicode 
  before it is used as a msgid.

v0.6.1
------

- :class:`~easymode.admin.models.fields.DiocoreHTMLField` will now also show a tinymce editor when it
  is not internationalized.
- When there is a problem with monkey patching :class:`django.db.models.SubfieldBase` easymode
  will throw an exception. (Monkey patch fixes http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/12568).
- New field aded, :class:`~easymode.admin.models.fields.CSSField`, which allows specification of css classes
  for a rich text field, the css classes will appear in the xml as::
  
    style="class1,class2"

v0.6.0
------

- Django 1.2 is required for easymode as of v0.6.0.
- :func:`~easymode.utils.languagecode.get_real_fieldname` now returns 
  a string instead of :class:`unicode`. This way a :class:`dict` can
  be constructed using it's results as keys, and the dict can be turned
  into keyword arguments of ``filter`` when doing a query in a specific
  language.
- Small improvements in error handling when :ref:`auto_catalog` is ``True``

v0.5.7
------

- Added :class:`easymode.admin.models.fields.SafeTextField`, a textfield which strips
  all cariage returns before saving, which is required when using 
  :ref:`auto_catalog_ref`.
- Updated django requirement to v1.1.2 because python 2.6.5 will otherwise
  make the unit tests fail.

v0.5.6
------

- The example app now has a working fixture.

v0.5.5
------

- Special admin widgets are nolonger discarded by easymode (issue #3)

v0.5.4
------

- Some data files where not installed correctly by setup.py

v0.5.3
------

- Added :ref:`auto_catalog` setting, see :ref:`auto_catalog_ref`.
- Fixed error in :ref:`easy_locale` when two properties in the
  same model have the same value (eg. title and subtitle are the same).
