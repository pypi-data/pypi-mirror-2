In this example, the autohandler calls upon "m" to fetch both its immediate subclass
and the subclass of that subclass.   The "sub-sub-class", which represents
the ultimate file being served, is called to populate the content dictionary first.  
Then the "subclass", which defines the layout, is called
with the newly populated content dictionary as its arguments, which it
references via the %ARGS section.

This allows pages to select their own layout component, and
also makes the creation of new layouts easy as they contain virtually
no python code except straight variable substitutions.   
With layout and content in separate templates, brought together by 
the autohandler, the design is extremely close to the "model-view-controller"
paradigm.
