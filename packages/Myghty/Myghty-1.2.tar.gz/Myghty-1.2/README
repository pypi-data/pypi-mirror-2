Quick run of Myghty, browse docs, try examples:

    python ./tools/run_docs.py

Then point your browser over to:

    http://localhost:8000/

To install, change to your superuser's account, and type:

    python setup.py install

This uses a setuptools, which is a new Python Eggs-based install and requires 
network access to install dependencies.

The above setup will detect previous versions of Myghty installed by the 
old distutils and produce a "conflict warning".  If an old version of 
Myghty is still present, you can delete it manually, or you can run the 
ez_setup script to remove it:

    python setup.py easy_install -D Myghty

If frustrated, network access is not working, dependencies crashing, etc., 
the old version of the setup script is present, which will install just the 
Myghty core libraries:

    python setup.py install --old-and-unmanageable

Note that installing the old way (distutils_setup.py) will create conflicts 
with the new way (setup.py), which would need to be resolved by removing 
the installed files before running the new way.

To build documentation:

    cd doc; python ./genhtml.py

which will build docs as flat html files in doc/html.

Configuration for mod_python, CGI, others are in the "Configuration" chapter 
of the documentation.

Brand new Python Paste setup templates, which automatically build sample 
configurations that are runnable via command line, are present too, and are 
outlined in the "Installation" chapter of the documentation.  Basically, 
install Myghty, which will also download and install Python Paste.

Then install the .egg version of WSGIUtils, via:

    python ez_setup.py http://pylons.groovie.org/files/WSGIUtils-0.6-py2.4.egg

Then cd into a target directory and type:

    /path/to/python/bin/paster create --template=myghty_simple myprojectname
    cd myprojectname
    paster serve server.conf

The site is then available via http://localhost:8000 .

Available templates are "myghty_simple", "myghty_modulecomponents" and 
"myghty_routes", which shows off the new Routes extension resolver.

More examples are available in ./examples.
