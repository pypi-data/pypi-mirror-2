  Thanks to Yoshinori Okuji for the patch!

1.1.1 (12 Mar 2006)
-------------------

- Fixed bug that meant rendering a MailTemplate or
  FSMailTemplate would set the content type of the RESPONSE to
  that of the MailTemplate.

- Fixed a deprecation warning with Zope 2.9 at the expense of
  compatability with Zope 2.7 or less.

1.1.0 (15 Oct 2005) 
-------------------

- Corrected and wrote tests for the examples in readme.txt.

  Thanks to Nicolas Georgakopoulos for testing these!

- Fixed the security declaration for BaseMailTemplate's _send
  method. 

  Thanks to Jens Quade for the patch!

- Fixed a critical bug in MTMultipart's security declarations
  that prevented add_file from being used within python
  scripts.

  Thanks to Nicolas Georgakopoulos for reporting this!

- Fixed a bug where specifying content_type in a .metadata
  accompanying an FSMailTemplate caused errors if you tried to
  customise that FSMailTemplate.

- Check that the mail host specified is really a mail host and
  give feedback on the edit screen if this isn't the case.

  Thanks to Nicolas Georgakopoulos for reporting this!

- Added support to the add_file method so that files can be
  added using a string of data and a string containing the
  filename.

- Added the ability to explicitly set the content type when
  calling add_file.

- Fixed the tests to run in Zope 2.8, CMF 1.5 and 
  Zope 2.6, CMF 1.4. 

- Implemented _readFile in FSMailTemplate. This is primarily to
  work around a bug in CMF 1.4, but also means _readFile is
  much simpler for FSMailTemplates and there won't be suprises later.

1.0.0 (10 Oct 2005)
-------------------

- Added encoding support and documentation explaining how
  unicode and encoded string data must be handled.

- A date header is now set on all emails sent.
 
- An exception is now raised if certain required parameters
  cannot be looked up anywhere.

- Made header lookup with respect to sourcing from parameter,
  properties and the headers parameter/property work as
  expected.

- Added documentation.

- as_message now returns an object that has both a 'send'
  method and an 'add_file' method.

- Security declarations to allow the use of the whole email
  package from restricted code.

- Corrected copyright statements.

- Add support for MaildropHost   

- give friendlier error messages when no MailHost is specified
  or where the specified one can no longer be found.

- Prevent \r showing up in rendered mails

- Make tests run on both unix and windows.

- Added new icons       

0.8.0 (21 Jun 2005)
-------------------

- Initial release
