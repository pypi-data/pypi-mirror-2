Description: Summary
        -------
        
        This cube provides a shopping cart functionality.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        By default, any entity can be added to a basket (this uses the
        `in_basket` relation).
        
        There is a box that displays all items in the basket. By default, this
        box is hidden. To display it, add in a view this code:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
        from cubes.basket.views import BasketBox
        
        BasketBox.visible = True
