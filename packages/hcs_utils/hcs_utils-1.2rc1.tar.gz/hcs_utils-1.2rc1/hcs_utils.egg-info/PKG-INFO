Description: About
        =====
        
        This is my personal collection of snippets that I use in multiple projects.
        Each one feels a bit to small to merit it's own library.
        
        So what does it include?
        
        * memoize decorator (caching)
        * a storage class wrapping a dict.
        * unittest assert functions.
        * Functions for handling large JSON documents.
        * list_dir(path) –> (dirnames, filenames)
        * PID file locking
        * A synchronization decorator
