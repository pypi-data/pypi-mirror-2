HCS Utils
=========

My personal python library, collecting some useful snippets.

Each module feels a bit small to handle as a library of it’s own.

So what does it include?

* memoize decorator (caching)
* a storage class wrapping a dict.
* unittest assert functions.
* Functions for handling large JSON documents.
* list_dir(path) –> (dirnames, filenames)
