Description: ======
        Sanity
        ======
        
        A quick and simple task manager built for teams in an intranet setting.
        It's very simple to use by just about anyone on a team.
        
        **Note**: This is in early stages of development, and may not be particularly
        useful to many people.
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        Assuming you're using a WSGI-compatible web server (for instance, the
        `mod_wsgi <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/>`_ module for Apache or
        `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`_ with other web servers), you can simply put
        the following into a file called *sanity.wsgi* and point your web server to
        it:
        
        ::
        
            from sanity import app
        
        More example scripts are available in the /contrib/ directory.
