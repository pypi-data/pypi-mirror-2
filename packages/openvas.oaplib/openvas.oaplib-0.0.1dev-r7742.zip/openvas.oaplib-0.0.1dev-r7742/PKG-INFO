        `OpenVAS`__ (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a network
        security scanner with associated tools. OpenVAS Version 3 introduces a
        new core component: The OpenVAS-Administrator. It is intended to
        simplify the configuration and administration of an OpenVAS server
        both on a local installation as well as on a remote system.
        
        __ http://www.openvas.org
        
        OpenVAS Administration Protocol (OAP) is the protocol based on XML to
        talk to the OpenVAS-Administrator. `openvas.oaplib` is a pure-Python
        implementation of OAP which allows easy access to the
        OpenVAS-Administrator.
        
        This package also includes a command line tool `oap-cli` which uses
        sub-commands like svn or openssl does. See examples below.
        
        Example::
        
        admin = openvas.oaplib.OAPClient(host=sensor)
        admin.open(username, password)
        admin.create_user(name, password, role, hosts)
        admin.modify_user(name, role="Admin")
        admin.sync_feed()
        # ... later ...
        settings = admin.get_settings()
        pprint.pprint(settings)
        
        `openvas.opmlib` also supports a low-level interface where you can send
        OAP XML directly::
        
        help_text = admin.xml('<help/>')
        
        
        Examples for `oap-cli` usage:
        
        oap-cli --help            # get help
        oap-cli get-users --help  # get help on subcommand get-users
        oap-cli create-user --new-pass xxx john
        oap-cli get-users john

        Requirements and Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `openvas.oaplib` requires
        
        * `Python 2.5`__ or higher with SSL support (which should be the
        default on most platforms) (NB: Python 3.x is *not* supported)
        * `setuptools`__ for installation (see below).
        * `argparse`__ (already included in Python starting with Python 2.7)
        
        __ http://www.python.org/download/
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse
        
        
        :Hints for installing on Windows: Following the links above you will
        find .msi and .exe-installers. Simply install them and continue
        with `installing openvas.oaplib`_.
        
        :Hints for installing on Linux: Most current Linux distributions
        provide packages for the requirements. Look for packages names like
        `python-setuptools` and `python-argparse`. Simply install them and
        continue with `installing openvas.oaplib`_.
        
        :Hint for installing on other platforms: Many vendors provide Python.
        Please check your vendors software repository. Otherwise please
        download Python 2.6 (or any higer version from the 2.x series) from
        http://www.python.org/download/ and follow the installation
        instructions there.
        
        After installing Python, install `setuptools`__. You may want to
        read `More Hints on Installing setuptools`_ first.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
        
        Using setuptools, compiling and installing the remaining
        requirements is a piece of cake::
        
        # if the system has network access
        easy_install argparse
        
        # without network access download argparse
        # from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse and run
        easy_install argparse-*.zip
        
        
        Installing openvas.oaplib
        ---------------------------------
        
        When you are reading this you most probably already downloaded and
        unpacked `openvas.oaplib`. Thus installing is as easy as running::
        
        python ./setup.py install
        
        Otherwise you may install directly using setuptools/easy_install. If
        your system has network access installing `openvas.oaplib` is a
        breeze::
        
        easy_install openvas.oaplib
        
        Without network access download `openvas.oaplib` from
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/openvas.oaplib and run::
        
        easy_install openvas.oaplib-*.tar.gz
        
        
        More Hints on Installing setuptools
        ------------------------------------
        
        `openvas.oaplib` uses setuptools for installation. Thus you need
        either
        
        * network access, so the install script will automatically download
        and install setuptools if they are not already installed
        
        or
        
        * the correct version of setuptools preinstalled using the
        `EasyInstall installation instructions`__. Those instructions also
        have tips for dealing with firewalls as well as how to manually
        download and install setuptools.

        Custom Installation Locations
        ------------------------------
        
        `openvas.oaplib` is just a single script (aka Python program). So you can
        copy it where ever you want (maybe fixing the first line). But it's
        easier to just use::
        
        # install to /usr/local/bin
        python ./setup.py install --prefix /usr/local
        
        # install to your Home directory (~/bin)
        python ./setup.py install --home ~
        
        
        Please mind: This effects also the installation of pfPDf (and
        setuptools) if they are not already installed.
        
        For more information about Custom Installation Locations please refer
        to the `Custom Installation Locations Instructions`__ before
        installing `openvas.oaplib`.
