        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `JSON2`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`JSON-js`: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.json2``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``json2`` from ``js.json2`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.json2 import json2
          >>> json2.need()
