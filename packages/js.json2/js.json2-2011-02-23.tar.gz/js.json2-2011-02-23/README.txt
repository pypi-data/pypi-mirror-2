js.json2
********

Introduction
============

This library packages `JSON2`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`JSON-js`: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.json2``) are published to some URL.
