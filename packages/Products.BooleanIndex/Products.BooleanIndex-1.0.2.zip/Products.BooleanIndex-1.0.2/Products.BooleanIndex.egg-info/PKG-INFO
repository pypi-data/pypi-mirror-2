Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a specialized ZCatalog index type which does not actually store False
        values in its forward index and thus reduces the persistent footprint of the
        index.
        
        Queries for True values are done with a normal intersection against the
        forward index.
        
        If experimental.catalogqueryplan is used queries for False values are done via
        the difference of the passed in result set and the forward index. If no result
        set is passed in, the difference of the forward index and the unindex is used.
