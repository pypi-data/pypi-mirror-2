- when a group is deleted, its relationship to a user in [users_user_groups__users_group_users]
    is not deleted (and other FK relationships need to be maintained)

- need some kind of note on the permission map for super users
- create a permissions map that shows each permission and where it has been
    approved/denied (i.e. non user specific)

- in this and the contactform delete view, we need to make sure that if the item is not deleted that the error message is given

- password policy enforcement
