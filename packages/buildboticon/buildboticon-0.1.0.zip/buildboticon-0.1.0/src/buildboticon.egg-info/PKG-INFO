Description: =====================
        BuildBotIcon (python)
        =====================
        
        BuildBotIcon is a system tray monitor for the BuildBot continuous integration framework. 
        
        It shows a colored icon (the BuildBot nut) in the system tray and changes it depending on the 
        state of your builders. 
        
        It also plays sounds when the state changes.
        
        The tool can also control lava lamps (or other devices) via a Phidgets USB board.
        
        There is also a Java version available, if you prefer that.
