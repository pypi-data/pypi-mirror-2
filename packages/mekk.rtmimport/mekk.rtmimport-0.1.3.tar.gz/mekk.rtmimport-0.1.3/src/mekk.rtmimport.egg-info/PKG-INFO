        ================
        
        ``mekk.rtmimport`` handles importing data to RememberTheMilk. At the
        moment it handles importing data exported from Nozbe_, I keep more
        generic name in case I write other importers in the future.
        
        Prerequisities
        ==============
        
        ``mekk.rtmimport`` uses `RtmAPI`_ wrapper library. I had to patch it
        a bit and 0.3.2 is likely to fail. I hope to have my patches accepted
        but until newer version is released, one must use `my RtmAPI fork`_
        (use get source link to download `.zip` file, unpack it, install
        by `python setup.py install`).

        From Nozbe to RememberTheMilk
        =============================
        
        Exporting the data from Nozbe
        -----------------------------
        
        Prepare `.json` export of Nozbe_ data. For details see `mekk.nozbe`_
        but usually you just want to::
        
            nozbetool export --json=mynozbedata.json
        
        Importing data to RememberTheMilk
        ---------------------------------
        
        First make a test run::
        
            rtmimport --nozbe-json=mynozbedata.json --verbose --dry-run
        
        (it does not store anything, just prints what it is to do) and verify
        whether everything seems correct. 
        
        Then make actual import::
        
            rtmimport --nozbe-json=mynozbedata.json --verbose
        
        (or omit `--verbose` if you don't want to track progress, but I
        recommend you keep it)
        
        Note: import can take some time. In case of my big list over
        not-so-good network it has been running for almost an hour.
        
        How the data is converted
        -------------------------
        
        Nozbe projects are saved as RememberTheMilk lists.
        
        Nozbe contexts are converted to RememberTheMilk tags. `@` is prepended
        to their names and non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with
        dashes (so for example `My home/kitchen` becomes
        `@My-home-kitchen`). 
        
        Next actions are tagged as `Next`.
        
        Actions are saved as tasks. Name, due date, recurrence, 
        estimated cost and completion status are all saved.
        
        In case of recurrence, RTM ``every`` mode is used (so the task marked
        on Nozbe as recurring every week will be spawned 52 times a year by
        RTM, whether user completes it, or not). If you prefer alternative way
        (spawning new incarnation whenever previous is completed), edit tasks
        after import, patch the code (and replace `every` with `after`), or
        ask me for a commandline flag).
        
        As notes are bound to projects on Nozbe, and to tasks on
        RememberTheMilk, I save notes by creating artificial tasks named "Save
        this note" (one per every list for which appropriate project had notes)
        and binding notes to those tasks. This must be handled afterwards
        using RTM interface, to make sure it happens I mark those tasks as due
        immediately. Those task are also tagged as `Note`.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        Only main context is copied, additional contexts are lost. I don't know
        how to grab them from Nozbe_ (in case somebody knows how to patch
        `mekk.nozbe`_ to grab all contexts, I can extend this importer easily
        to handle them all).
        
        Uploads are not copied (= lost). I neither now how to export them from
        Nozbe, nor RTM is able to handle them.
        
        Action name formatting is not available on RememberTheMilk, so if you
        used constructs like `Visit "the website":http://google.com`, they will
        show up as is.
        
        Sharing information (= information about delegations to other users)
        is lost. I haven't used this feature so I don't know how do the
        underlying data look like.
        
        Some contexts could probably be converted to locations, not tags, but
        I don't have an idea how to decide which way to go.
        
        Problems and workarounds
        ------------------------
        
        If import process is interrupted, re-running it would make duplicate
        tasks (there is no duplicate checking, it would be costly). The best
        way to resolve it is to open .json file in text editor (after making a
        backup copy of it) and simply cut all actions which were already saved
        (they are saved in order, so it is just a matter of locating the last
        action saved before the process was interrupted).
