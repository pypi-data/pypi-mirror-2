Description: Dynamic Tree-Widget for Plone
        =============================
        
        collective.dynatree provides the basic integration of the jQuery plugin
        `jquery.dynatree.js <http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/index.html>`_ (at
        `google-code <http://code.google.com/p/dynatree/>`_).
        
        Optional it also provides a full-featured Archetypes Widget with full
        ATVocabularyManager support, including hierachical VDEX-vocabularies.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Just depend in your buildout on the egg ``collective.dynatree``. ZCML is loaded
        automagically if z3c.autoinclude is available (default since Plone >=3.3).
        
        Install it as an addon in Plone control-panel or portal_setup.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        --------------
        Plain Dynatree
        --------------
        
        This package only provides and registers the javascript in the site. Addon
        developers can use it then in their own templates. Please refer to the
        `original documentation <http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html>`_
        for usage of ``jquery.dynatree.js``.
        
        -----------------
        Archetypes Widget
        -----------------
        
        The widget is meant to be used on a ``StringField`` (single selection) or on a
        ``LinesField`` (multi selection).
        
        Example
        -------
        ::
        
        StringField('single_leafs',
        required=0,
        vocabulary=NamedVocabulary('some_atvm_tree_vocabulary'),
        widget=DynatreeWidget(
        description="Select one option of tree. Only leafs allowed",
        leafsOnly=True,
        selectMode=1),
        ),
        LinesField('multiple_all',
        required=0,
        vocabulary=NamedVocabulary('another_atvm_tree_vocabulary'),
        widget=DynatreeWidget(
        description="""Select multiple options of the tree. All selectable.
        Starts with 2 levels expanded.""",
        selectMode=3,
        minExpandLevel=2),
        ),
        
        Widget Parameters
        -----------------
        (additional to the usal suspects of TypesWidget)
        
        selectMode
        1=single, 2=multiple
        
        minExpandLevel
        Number of levels which are not allowed to collapse; default=0.
        
        rootVisible
        Wether a root node should be showed or not; default=False.
        
        autoCollapse
        Automatically collapse all siblings, when a node is expanded;
        default=False.
        
        leafsOnly
        Wether to select only leafs or allow also to select nodes with leafs;
        default=False.
        
        showKey
        To show the terms key in front of the terms value set this to a format
        string like ``"%s: %s"``; default=None.
        
        -------------------
        Example-ContentType
        -------------------
        
        An example ContentType is provided, but disabled by default. To enable it add
        ``collective.dynatree[example]`` to both, the eggs and zcml section in your
        buildout. Rerun buildout, restart Plone and install the
        ``jquery.dynatree EXAMPLE Content Types`` as an add-on product.
