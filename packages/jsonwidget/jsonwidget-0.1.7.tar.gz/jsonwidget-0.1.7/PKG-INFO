Description: jsonwidget is a general-purpose JSON validation and manipulation library.  This
        library provides the following functions for applications:
        
        *  Validation of JSON-compatible data against a schema
        *  Automatic generation of a schema from JSON-compatible data
        *  Construction of a curses-based tree data editing user interface from a schema
        *  Construction of a Javascript-based web tree data editing user interface
        from a schema
        *  Simple WSGI server to serve the web user interface, and validate and store
        result of editing with the web user interface
        
        Though jsonwidget is optimized for working with JSON, it is useful for
        providing editing capability for any JSON-compatible data structure.
        
        The following utilities are included with jsonwidget:
        
        * jsonedit - A terminal-based application (like you would use via SSH or
        local terminal on Linux and Mac). It's based on urwid, an excellent
        Python-based library for building terminal-based user interfaces.
        * csvedit - A variation on jsonedit that allows editing of .csv/tsv files.
        * jsonaddress - an example JSON address book editor
        * jwc - a command line utility with the following functions:
        
        * editserver - launch a web server to edit a json file from a browser
        * json2yaml - convert a json file to yaml with comments pulled from schema
        (also yaml2json to go back)
        * schemagen - create a schema from an example json file
        * validate - validate a JSON file against a schema
