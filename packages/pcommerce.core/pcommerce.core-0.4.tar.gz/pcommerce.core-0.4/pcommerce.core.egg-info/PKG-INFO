Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        PCommerce (Plone commerce) provides a simple shop system which supports:
        
        * product variations
        * multiple prices per product to support special prices per user or group
          (over the sharing tab) and prices only available for a specific time
          (by using the expiration date)
        * multiple pluggable payment methods
        * multiple currencies by using Products.CurrencyUtility
        
        
        Pluggable Payment Methods
        -------------------------
        
        To register a new payment method for PCommerce register a utility implementing
        the IPaymentMethod interface. If your payment method requires data from the user
        set the pre_view_name attribute of the utility to the name of the view implementing
        IPreOrderView which provides the necessary fields. If you would like to display
        information after ordering set the post_view_name attribute to the name of the
        view providing those.
        
        For a simple example pcommerce.email provides a payment method which simply sends
        an email to the administrator containing the billing address.
