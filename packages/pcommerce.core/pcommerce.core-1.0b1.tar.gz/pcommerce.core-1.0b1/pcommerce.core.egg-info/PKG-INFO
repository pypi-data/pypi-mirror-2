Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        PCommerce (Plone commerce) provides a simple shop system which supports:
        
        * product variations
        * multiple prices per product to support special prices per user or group
          (over the sharing tab) and prices only available for a specific time
          (by using the expiration date)
        * multiple pluggable payment methods
        * multiple pluggable shipment methods
        * multiple taxes by zone
        * pre and post tax charges per payment and shipment method
        * component based checkout to easily customize the checkout process
        * multiple currencies by using Products.CurrencyUtility
        
        
        Pluggable Payment Methods
        -------------------------
        
        A payment plugin consists of a named adapter implementing
        pcommerce.core.interfaces.IPaymentMethod and named by the id (usually
        the package name) of the method and one or more views injecting data
        into the checkout process. The views are registered for the payment
        method and have to implement pcommerce.core.interfaces.IPaymentView.
        The name of the view corresponds to the name of the component where
        the data has to be injected (e.g. payment, confirmation, overview etc.).
        
        As an example of a simple payment plugin pcommerce.payment.invoice is
        available, which simply collects a billing address and injects it into
        the confirmation and order email.
        
        
        Pluggable Shipment Methods
        --------------------------
        
        A shipment plugin works much like a payment plugin, the only differences
        are the interfaces to be implemented by the adapter and the corresponding
        views, which there are pcommerce.core.interfaces.IShipmentMethod respectively
        pcommerce.core.interfaces.IShipmentView.
        
        As an example pcommerce.shipment.parcel is available, which collects a delivery
        address and injects it into the confirmation and order email.
        
        
        Optional dependencies
        ---------------------
        
        Products.CurrencyUtility - to add support for multiple currencies
