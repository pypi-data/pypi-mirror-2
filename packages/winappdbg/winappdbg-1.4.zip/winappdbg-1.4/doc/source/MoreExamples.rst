.. _time-to-debug:

Set a debugging timeout
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes you'll want to set a maximum time to debug your target, especially when fuzzing. This is an example on how to code a custom debugging loop with a timeout. It launches the Windows Calculator and stops when the target process is closed or after a 5 seconds timeout.

.. _memory-dump-example:

Dump the memory of a process
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is an example on how to dump the memory map and contents of a process into an SQLite database. A table is created where each row is a memory region, and the columns are the properties of that region (address, size, mapped filename, etc.) and it's data. The data is compressed using zlib to reduce the database size, but simply commenting out line 160 stores the data in uncompressed form.

.. _find-alnum:

Find alphanumeric addresses to jump to
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example will find all memory addresses in a target process that are executable and whose address consists of alphanumeric characters only. This is useful when exploiting a stack buffer overflow and the input string is limited to alphanumeric characters only.

.. _trace-gdi-text:

Trace all calls to text drawing in GDI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example hooks all text drawing functions in GDI and prints the text. It can be useful to extract text messages and logs from GUI programs.

.. _atoms:

Enumerate all named global atoms
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Global atoms are WORD numeric values that can be associated to arbitrary strings. They are used primarily for IPC purposes on Windows. This example shows how to retrieve the string from any atom value.
