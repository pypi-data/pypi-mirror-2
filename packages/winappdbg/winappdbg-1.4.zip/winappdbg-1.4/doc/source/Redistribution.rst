Building your own distribution packages
***************************************

*WinAppDbg* is released under the :download:`BSD license <../../../misc/license/bsd.txt>`, so as a user you are entitled to create derivative work and redistribute it if you wish. A makefile is provided to automatically generate the source distribution package and the Windows installer, and can also generate the documentation for all the modules using Epydoc.

Prerequisites
-------------

A Make utility is required to use the makefile. Without it you're going to have to run each command manually to generate the documentation and packages. We're using GNU Make for Windows from the `GNU Win32 project <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Tar and BZip2 utilities are required to compress .tar.bz2 files. We're also using the packages from the `GNU Win32 project <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/>`_.

The `Epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_ package is required to autogenerate the documentation. [http://www.graphviz.org/ GraphViz] is used by Epydoc to generate UML graphs for the documentation.

This documentation was generated using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. The reStructuredText sources are provided with the source code downloads only.

A Latex compiler is used to generate the documentation in PDF format. We're currently using `MikTex 2.7 <http://miktex.org/>`_ on Windows.

The HTML help can be compiled to a .CHM file using `Microsoft HTML Help Workshop <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154968>`_.

The `py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org/>`_ package is used to generate standalone binaries for the tools. This step is optional. You can (also optionally) compress the executables with `UPX <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>`_.

All of these tools should be present in the **PATH** environment variable.

Installer script
----------------

Both the source code and Windows installer packages are generated with the Distutils standard package, which is already shipped with your Python distribution. The :download:`setup.py <../../setup.py>` file is the installer script that contains the package metadata and the list of files to include.

You can find more information on Distutils installer scripts `here <http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html>`_.

Makefile usage
--------------

The :download:`Makefile <../../Makefile>` is run using the "make" command. These are the commands supported by our makefile:

Building the project
++++++++++++++++++++

* **make all**

  Generates the all documentation and builds all the packages.

* **make clean**

  Removes all files and directories created by the other make commands.

Building each component
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* **make doc**

  Generates only the documentation, in all supported formats but CHM (the HTML Help Workshop returns an error condition because of warnings, which would stop the make process).

* **make html**

  Generates only the documentation in HTML format.

* **make pdf**

  Generates only the documentation in PDF format.

* **make chm**

  Generates only the documentation in CHM format. Depends on the HTML documentation.

* **make dist**

  Builds only the distribution packages, in all supported formats, for the current platform and architecture.

* **make sdist**

  Builds only the source distribution package (that is, the *zip* file). This package contains the documentation and can later be used to install the module by uncompressing it and running *setup.py*.

* **make bdist**

  Builds only the Windows installer package (that is, the *exe* file) for the current platform and architecture. This package does not contain the documentation and cannot be manually extracted to search for individual files.

* **make py2exe**

  Builds standalone binaries for the tools, using `py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org/>`_. This step is optional.

* **make upx**

  Compresses the executables generated wth **py2exe**, using `UPX <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>`_. This step is optional.

Directory structure
-------------------

This is the directory structure expected for the makefile and the install script to work.

Input directories
+++++++++++++++++

* **/examples**

  This folder contains the example scripts shipped with python-winappdbg. They're the same examples found in the project wiki pages. It's included **only** in the source distribution package.

* **/tools**

  This folder contains the utility scripts shipped with python-winappdbg. It's included in both the source distribution package and the Windows installer.

* **/winappdbg**

  This folder contains the winappdbg module files. It's included in both the source distribution package and the Windows installer.

Output directories
++++++++++++++++++

* **/build**

  Temporary folder created when building the source distribution and Windows installer. You can safely delete this.

* **/dist**

  This is where the source distribution and the Windows installer files are stored.

* **/dist/py2exe**

  This is where the standalone binary files are stored. It's only created when the **make py2exe** command is run.

* **/html**

  This is where the autogenerated documentation files are stored, in HTML format. If you compile this documentation into a .CHM file it'll also be stored here.

* **/pdf**

  This is where the autogenerated documentation files are stored, in PDF and PostScript format.
