Releasing a new version of BlueBream
====================================

First run the buildout in an isolated virtualenv::

    $ virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages sandbox
    $ ./sandbox/bin/python bootstrap.py
    $ ./bin/buildout


Then update the version of packages in `versions.cfg`.
You should probably extend the latest version of the ZTK
You can discover new package versions by running::

    $ ./bin/checkversions buildout.cfg # (use the -l option if needed))

Run the compatibility tests for the additional BlueBream packages::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    $ ./bin/test

If all tests pass, release a new version using the included `zest.releaser`,
or manually with the following steps:

- set the correct version number in `setup.py`
- update the `CHANGELOG.txt`
- commit and create a tag for this new version
- change `setup.py` and the `CHANGELOG.txt` to point to the next dev version

- create a clean checkout of the tag in a new directory and run::

    $ python setup.py register sdist upload

- upload `versions.cfg` with the correct name to http://download.zope.org/bluebream/
