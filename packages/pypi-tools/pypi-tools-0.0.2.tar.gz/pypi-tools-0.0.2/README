Usage

Let's find something. What about some django gravatar application?

    $ pypi django avatar
    $ 

Hmm, nothing. Ok, maybe just gravatar? :)

    $ pypi gravatar
    django-gravatar                - Gravatar Support in a Django Reusable Application
    gravatar                       - Gravatar generator. Includes all API parameters included in their documentation.
    tw.gravatar                    - inserts gravatar images
    tw.gravatar                    - inserts gravatar images

Cool. It found something. Duplicated tw.gravatar line looks like a bug :)

Let's see what is tw.gravatar.

    $ pypi -s tw.gravatar
     name:                tw.gravatar
     summary:             inserts gravatar images

Ooops, it is not django application.

``pypi`` command understand complex search queries. You can see the list of search
operators in ``pypi -h`` output.

Here is example of searching all crap I have uploaded on the Python Package Index:

    lorien@big:/web/pypi-tools$ ./pypi --author_email lorien@lorien.name
    django-account                 - Django application for registration and authentication
    django-bookmarker              - Social bookmark linsk
    django-common                  - A number of useful django shortcuts and helpers
    ...
