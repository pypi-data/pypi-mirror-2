CORR

This package provides functions to control modern CASPER packetised correlators.  It also provides a general-purpose wrapper for communicating with ROACH boards over KATCP (src/katcp_wrapper.py).  

DEVELOPMENT OF THIS VERSION WAS HALTED ON 2010-10-27 AS DEVELOPMENT ON CORR-0.6.0 STARTED (WHICH HAS 10GBE PORTS IN F ENGINES). IT IS UNTESTED. YMMV.

Correlators are configured by writing a configuration file. An example is provided in the root directory of this package (example.conf). This file should match the bitstreams' configurations (Simulink parameters).

Requires:
    - iniparse, numpy, stats, matplotlib (if plotting outputs), katcp, PySPEAD.

ToDo:
    - Support for parallel connections to ROACH boards. Right now, commands issued to multiple boards are processed sequentially. It should be possible to gain speedups by issuing such commands in parallel. 
    - Error handling needs to be unified and coded to use logging everywhere rather than printing errors to the console.

Changelog:

Version 0.5.1
    - Bugfixes relating to KATADC/iADC use.
    - Started moving all scripts to function calls.
    - First PyPI submission.
    - DEVELOPMENT OF THIS VERSION WAS HALTED ON 2010-10-27 AS DEVELOPMENT ON CORR-0.6.0 STARTED (WHICH HAS 10GBE PORTS IN F ENGINES). IT IS UNTESTED.

Version 0.5.0
    - Requires reconfigurable (ie ROACH) F engines. Support for iBOB-based F engines has been dropped as we switch to KATCP-only connections.
    - Changed configuration parsing library to iniparse.

Version 0.4.0 
    - KATCP control protocol.
