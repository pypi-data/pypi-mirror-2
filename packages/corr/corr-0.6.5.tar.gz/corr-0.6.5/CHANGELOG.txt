Changelog:
Version 0.6.5 (2011-03-01):
    - Added software control for KATADC and iADC.

Version 0.6.4 (2011-02-09):
    - Bug fixes for systems using xaui loopback
    - added clear facilities to fstatus
    - removed stats library dependancy
    - bug fixes to scroller
    - bug fixes to snap capture in katcp_wrapper

Version 0.6.2 (2010-11-26):
    - Added example.conf file to distribution package.
    - Fix to corr_xstatus.py for case where F engines have 10GbE out and X engines have 10GbE (fabric) output.
    - Mod to corr_rx_cont_h5.py to allow for commanline disable of n_acc scaleback.
    - Mod to corr_arm to resync vaccs after rearm.
     
Version 0.6.1 (2010-11-25):
    - Fix to corr_snap_quant.py script.

Version 0.6.0
    - Support added for F engines that output data directly on 10GbE ports (ie no XAUI loopback through X engines). 
    - Support added for X engines that process contiguous frequency chunks.
    - Should be backwards compatible with XAUI systems and X engines that process interleaved channels (corr-0.5.1).
    - Error handling mostly unified and coded to use logging everywhere rather than printing errors to the console.
    - Added funtion to check firmware versions.
    - Added SPEAD metadata.
    - Feng/Xeng ctrl registers now keep state across function calls and can automatically pulse, set or clear bits.
    - ADC and Requant histogram plotting improvements
    - Shift to curses display for ADC amplitudes and status reporting
    - Fix to fine delay calc in fr_delay_set call and added ability to disable load check.
    - New config file params to support above features. Some redundant and unnecessary params removed.

Version 0.5.1
    - Bugfixes relating to KATADC/iADC use.
    - Moving all scripts to function calls.
    - First PyPI submission.
    - Incomplete and untested. Development abandoned to start work on system with native Feng 10Gbe out.

Version 0.5.0 2010-07-xx
    - Requires reconfigurable (ie ROACH) F engines. Support for iBOB-based F engines has been dropped as we switch to KATCP-only connections.
    - Changed configuration parsing library to iniparse.
    - significant changes to corr_functions and cn_conf to support ROACH based F engines.

ver0.4.2: 2010-04-02
    *) tgtap call in katcp_wrapper now takes another parameter to allow naming of tap devices. *NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE*
    *) antenna numbering now correct off F engines.
    *) cn_tx.py replaced by corr_tx.py
    *) cleanup of some functions.

Version 0.4.0 
    - KATCP control protocol.
