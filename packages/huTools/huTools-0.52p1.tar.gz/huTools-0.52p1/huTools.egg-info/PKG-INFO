        huTools is a small collection of helpful tools we use. Containing helppers for calendar calculations, banking
        tools, checksummming, decorators, local unique IDs (luids), Netstrings, obfuscation (encription defending
        against your little brother), printing, a ReReadingConfigParser, robust typecasts, access dicts like an
        object and the other way arround, unicode processing country codes, file system operations and xmlstuff.
        
        It also installs the famous reindent.py code quality checker. Try
        `reindent.py .` to fix your current source tree.
