Debugging problems
==================
All log messages are sent to the standard Zope event log 'event.log'. In 
order to see more verbose logging output you need to increase the log level 
in your Zope instance's zope.conf. See the 'eventlog' directive. Setting 
the 'level' key to 'debug' will maximize log output and may help pinpoint 
problems during setup and testing.
