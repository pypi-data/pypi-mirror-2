Whizzer is a simple library built around the pyev module. Its named after 
one of my favorite rollercoasters of all time.

Purpose:
Whizzer is meant to make writting fast non-blocking socket servers using pyev 
relatively simple.

It might look similiar in nature to Twisted. Thats because I believe Twisted 
does things right! It is not my goal to reinvent all of Twisted. I simply wanted
a socket handling library that was based on pyev. Implementing a pyev reactor 
seemed like a larger task then mimicking Twisted's Deferred, Protocol,
and ProtocolFactory ideas. I still don't think I was wrong.
