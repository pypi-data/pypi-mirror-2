Whizzer is a simple library built around the pyev module. Its named after 
one of my favorite rollercoasters of all time.

Purpose:
Whizzer is meant to make writting fast non-blocking socket servers with pyev
simpler than using pyev by itself. It provides a basic abstraction for a socket
server, client handling, and the protocol that the server is meant to talk.

It might look similiar in nature to Twisted. Thats because I believe Twisted 
does things right in the case of socket server abstraction. However I wanted
an event driven library that was smaller, better documented, focused
entirely on sockets, and used pyev.

It just happens that Python's up and coming futures PEP fit nicely in with
the idea and I felt it would be useful when making something like an RPC
library that used Whizzer.

Anyways, here it all is, a Twisted, pyev based clone, that works with
Python 3k and attempts to be PEP8 compliant.

Improve at your discretion.
