Changelog
=========

2.13.1 (2010-08-04)
-------------------

- Make sure that methods returning objects return them Acquisition wrapped.

- Be more careful in calling our own keys, values and items methods, as
  sub-classes might have overridden some of them.

2.13.0 (2010-07-11)
-------------------

- Changed the `objectIds`, `objectItems` and `objectValues` methods to use the
  internal OOBTree methods directly if no `spec` argument is passed.

- Change implementation of `keys`, `items` and `values` method to access the
  `self._tree` OOBTree methods directly. This avoids lookups in the meta_types
  structures.

- Implement the full dictionary protocol including `__getitem__`,
  `__delitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__nonzero__`, `__iter__` and `__contains__`.

- Released as separate package.
