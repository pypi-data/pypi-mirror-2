Installing the Test Recorder
============================

This package is designed to be directly deployable in Zope 2 or Zope 3
applications.  Since the actual testrecorder is just JavaScript code,
it can be deployed in probably any web application that allows the
injection of arbitrary resource files.


Zope 2
------

For a Zope 2 system, drop the ``zope/testrecorder`` directory into the
``Products`` directory of the Zope instance and restart the instance.
After restart, it will be possible to add a ``Test Recorder`` object
in the ZMI.  The Test Recorder Zope object mainly provides the ability
to traverse to the ``.html`` and ``.js`` files that make up the
recorder.


Zope 3
------

In a Zope 3 or Five environment, you can install the
``zope.testrecorder`` as an additional package into your instance's
``lib/python`` directory, e.g. with::

  $ python setup.py install --home=$INSTANCE_HOME

where $INSTANCE_HOME points ot your Zope instance.  Then you only need
to load the testrecorder's ZCML, by adding the following line to your
``site.zcml``:

  <include package="zope.testrecorder" />

Alternatively, you can put this line into a separate
``zope.testrecorder-configure.zcml`` file within your instance's
``package-includes`` directory.  After restarting your instance, the
testrecorder will be available through a resource URL,
e.g. http://localhost:8080/@@/recorder/index.html (Zope 3) or
http://localhost:8080/++resource++recorder/index.html (Five).
