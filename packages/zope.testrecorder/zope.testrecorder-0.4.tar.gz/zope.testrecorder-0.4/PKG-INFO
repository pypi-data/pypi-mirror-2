Description: =============
        Test Recorder
        =============
        
        The testrecorder is a browser-based tool to support the rapid
        development of functional tests for Web-based systems and
        applications.  The idea is to "record" tests by exercising whatever is
        to be tested within the browser.  The test recorder will turn a
        recorded session into a functional test.
        
        
        Output
        ------
        
        Test recorder supports two output modes:
        
        Selenium
          In this mode, the testrecorder spits out HTML markup that lets you
          recreate the browser test using the Selenium_ functional testing
          framework.
        
        Test browser
          In this mode, the testrecorder spits out a Python doctest_ that
          exercises a functional test using the Zope testbrowser_.  The Zope
          testbrowser allows you to programmatically simulate a browser from
          Python code.  Its main use is to make functional tests easy and
          runnable without a browser at hand.  It is used in Zope, but is not
          tied to Zope at all.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Like Selenium and the Zope test browser, the test recorder can very
        well be used to test any web application, be it Zope-based or not.  Of
        course, it was developed by folks from the Zope community for use with
        Zope.
