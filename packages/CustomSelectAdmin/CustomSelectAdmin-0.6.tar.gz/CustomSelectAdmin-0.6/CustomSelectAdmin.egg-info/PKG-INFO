Description: Overview
        ========
        This is a Trac plugin that adds an admin panel for every custom ticket field
        that is of type 'select' in the [ticket-custom] section of trac.ini. These
        panels behave very similarly to the 'Components,' 'Milestones,' 'Priorities,'
        etc. panels.
        
        Options
        -------
        This plugin allows the following option to be added to the [ticket-custom]
        section in trac.ini::
        
          <FIELDNAME>.panel = <PANELNAME>
        
        This is the string that will display as the title of the panel in the
        left-hand panel selection area in the Trac 'Admin' section.
