Overview
========
This is a Trac plugin that adds an admin panel for every custom ticket field
that is of type 'select' in the [ticket-custom] section of trac.ini. These
panels behave very similarly to the 'Components,' 'Milestones,' 'Priorities,'
etc. panels.

Options
-------
This plugin allows the following option to be added to the [ticket-custom]
section in trac.ini::

  <FIELDNAME>.panel = <PANELNAME>

This is the string that will display as the title of the panel in the
left-hand panel selection area in the Trac 'Admin' section.
