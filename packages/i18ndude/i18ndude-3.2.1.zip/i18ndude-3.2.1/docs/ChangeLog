2005-01-26  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* common.py (prepare_xml): Applied patch by Roel van der Steen.
	(#982527)

2004-01-14  Daniel Nouri  <daniel@con-fuse.org>

	* catalog.py (PTReader._make_msgstr): Include msgstr in POT-file.

	* i18ndude.py (filter_isfile): Now accepts directories on command-line.

2003-12-20  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* untranslated.py (_severity): Improved namespace awareness.

2003-12-12  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Added extract-literals and filter commands.

	* catalog.py: MessageCatalog uses an ordered dictionary now. POWriter
	can now write ids in the order of the source's appearance.

	* odict.py: Ordered dictionary implementation.

2003-11-07  Daniel Nouri  <daniel@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Some renaming and added --create option for
	'rebuild-pot' command.

2003-11-03 Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* catalog.py: Added update-pot command. It needs heavy testing now!

2003-11-03 Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: i18ndude now knows 'find-untranslated' (which used to be
	the only action in the versions before), 'update-pot' (not done) and
	'sync' commands. For a usage summary see "i18ndude --help".

	Note that 'sync' has only been tested sparsely. Please report any bugs
	or suggestions that you might have. When writing out the .po- file,
	sync orders entries by msgid, where 'literal' msgids come last.
	Therefore it is not possible to keep up with comments that are of
	chronological nature. ERASE THESE from the pot.

	I feel :( and *ugh* about the fact that there are actually two other
	projects that also aim to provide po-convenience. Sorry for the
	headbutt.

	* untranslated.py: Added. The contents were part of i18ndude.py before.

	* catalog.py: Added. Contains classes MessageCatalog, POParser,
	POWriter. PTReader, for reading from pts into a MessageCatalog is yet
	to be implemented. (See docstrings)

2003-10-20  Daniel Nouri  <daniel@tijuana>

	* i18ndude.py (SilentHandler.endDocument): SilentHandler does not
	mention parsed documents that had no errors or warnings anymore.

2003-10-11  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Applied patch from Jeroen Janssen, fixing a Python2.3
	related bug.

2003-10-03  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Now has a --silent mode (use it as the first argument)
	so that it reports a summary only.

2003-10-01 22:42  Daniel Nouri <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

    * i18ndude.py: Comments marked by tal:condition="nothing" are now ignored.
