Description: collective.setuphelpers
        =======================
        
        This package provides a few simple functions with common tasks used with initial
        site content setup.
        
        This does not aim to be as general as possible but it may speed things up.
        
        >>> from collective.setuphelpers.structure import setupStructure
        >>> portal = layer['portal']
        >>> STRUCTURE = [{'id':'example-id','title':'Example title','type':'Document'}]
        >>> setupStructure(portal, STRUCTURE)
        >>> portal['example-id']
        <ATDocument at /plone/example-id>
        >>> portal.manage_delObjects(['example-id'])
        
        You can use subfolders etc.
        
        >>> setupStructure(portal, layer['test_structure'])
        >>> portal['testfolder']['item1'].getText()
        '<p>Text body</p>'
        
        And many more - the readme will be improved with the next prerelease
