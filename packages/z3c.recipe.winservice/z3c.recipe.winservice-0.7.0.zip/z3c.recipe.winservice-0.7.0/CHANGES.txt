CHANGES
=======

0.7.0 (2010-10-19)
------------------

- New feature: ``runscript`` and ``parameters``.
  With those, this recipe is now capable of making any executable or
  python script a service.

- Added more docs and tests.

- Remove compiled winservice.pyc and pyo if they exist.

- Most folder calculation moved to the recipe installer.
  winservice.py gets constants, that makes it easier to see what happens.

- Updated tests to be more tolerant to different Python versions.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of deprecated
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.

Version 0.6.3 (2009-11-02)
--------------------------

- Do nothing on a non windows platform instead of failing.

Version 0.6.2 (2009-05-13)
--------------------------

- Set current dir for CreateProcess to INSTANCE_HOME otherwise pkg_resources will
  be pissed (in a combination with paster)

Version 0.6.1 (2009-05-12)
--------------------------

- kill off pythonw.exe - it just causes problems when something is

Version 0.6.0 (2009-05-10)
