CHANGES
=======

3.5.0 (2011-03-01)
------------------

  were removed in ``zope.component`` 3.6, thus requiring at least this
  version.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.

3.4.1 (2009-07-23)
------------------

- Explicitely list all dependencies. Fixes test failures.
