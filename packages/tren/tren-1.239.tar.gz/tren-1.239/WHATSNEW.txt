WHATSNEW For 'tren' 1.239    (Wed Nov 17 20:33:41 CST 2010)
----------------------------------------------------------------------


FIXED: Backups weren't being improperly named.

FIXED: Changed TREN envvar processing to properly parse quoting.

FIXED: Each renaming target must either be something that exists or a
       wildcard that expands to something that exists.  Formerly,
       nonexistent renaming targets were silently ignored.

NEW: Debug now shows the incremental change to each file name as each
     renaming request is applied left-to-right.  Use -dq to see this
     more clearly.

NEW: The environment variable TRENINCL is now supported.
     This allows you to specify a path to search when
     looking for include files.

NEW: Implemented /NAMESOFAR/ renaming token.

NEW: Added -e type case conversion option - new kind of renaming request.

        c - Capitalize
        l - Lower
        s - Swap case
        t - Title -> Char's followiing non-alpha are capitalized
        u - Upper

NEW: Added -T option to allow user to "target" a substring of
            the full filename for renaming

OTHER: Documentation additions and updates including
       clarification of old features, description of
       new features, and improved table-of-contents
       for PDF and PS document formats.
