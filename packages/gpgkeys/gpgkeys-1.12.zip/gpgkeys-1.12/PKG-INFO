        Command line shell for GnuPG
        ----------------------------
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        **gpgkeys** is a Python program that allows to conveniently
        manage GnuPG keys and keyrings.
        
        It serves as example application and testbed for the development of the
        rl_ library. In particular, gpgkeys contains a sophisticated implementation of
        `filename completion`_ which may one day find its way into a standalone
        package or rl_ add-on.

        Repository Access
        -----------------
        
        gpgkeys development is hosted on github_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        gpgkeys uses the rl_ library. Since rl_ contains a C extension, it is
        a good idea to review its `installation instructions`_ and make sure
        all dependencies are in place.
        
        To install the ``gpgkeys`` script, type::
        
            easy_install gpgkeys
        
        Then put it on your system PATH by e.g.  symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.

        Example Session
        ===============
        
        Everything in gpgkeys can be tab-completed: commands, help
        topics, userids, option flags, keyids, filenames, shell
        commands, and keyserver URLs.
        ::
        
            $ gpgkeys
            gpgkeys 1.12 (type help for help)
        
            gpgkeys> help
        
            Available commands (type help <topic>):
            =======================================
            EOF       del   export  genkey     import   lsign  refresh  shell
            checksig  dump  fdump   genrevoke  list     quit   search   sign
            clear     edit  fetch   help       listsig  recv   send     version
        
            Shortcut commands (type help <topic>):
            ======================================
            e  ll  ls
        
            gpgkeys> help export
            Usage: export <keyspec>
            Options: --armor --clean --minimal --output --secret
        
            Export keys to stdout or to a file
        
            gpgkeys> ls Stefan
            pub   1024R/E1F438AD 1995-10-03
            uid                  Stefan H. Holek (RSA) <stefan@epy.co.at>
        
            pub   1024D/355A2D28 2001-11-04
            uid                  Stefan H. Holek <stefan@epy.co.at>
            sub   2048g/A27E0DBC 2004-10-27
        
            gpgkeys> export --armor E1F438AD > stefan.asc
            gpgkeys> .ls
            alice.asc             stefan.asc
        
        gpgkeys understands shell pipes and input/output redirects. This
        allows command lines like::
        
            gpgkeys> export E1F438AD | pgpdump | less

        ----------------
        
        - Remove obsolete --secret option from the import command.
          [stefan]
        
        - Userid completion is now triggered by any kind of quoting.

          [stefan]
        
        - Dequoting didn't work right when the default quoting character
          was single quote.
          [stefan]
        
        - Tildes in quoted filenames could cause quotes to be closed even
          if the tilde-expanded name matched a directory.

        1.3 - 2010-01-03

        - Remove logging as it clutters up the code.
          [stefan]

        1.2 - 2009-11-24
        ----------------
        
        - Extend keyid completion to also complete userids and names.
          [stefan]
        
        - Extract filename completion functionality into functions,
          as it is useful in other places as well.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.1 - 2009-11-16
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to specify the filename quoting style on the command line
          to ease experimentation.
          [stefan]
        
        - Filename completion: By dequoting early on we can skip a problematic
          hook and regain control over tilde expansion. Also see rl `issue/3`_.
          [stefan]
        
        .. _`issue/3`: http://github.com/stefanholek/rl/issues#issue/3
