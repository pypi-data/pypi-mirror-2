"""
This is the device layer that manages the physical hardware and 
abstracts its use from the POS, ATM and other code.

The device layer catagorises the hardware under a generic set
of classifications defined in DEVICE_CLASSES. This is then used 
to provide a generic id when the need arises to directly address 
a device. The ids follow a path type syntax. The root of all is 
the 'device' node. Devices are then hung off the root node based
on the class they belong to. For example:

  /dev/printer
  /dev/display
  /dev/swipe
  /dev/sale
  :
  etc

Once a specifc device is registered for use in the configuration
then it gets added and aliased. For example a configuration entry
for the magtek usb swipe could be:

  [magtekusb]
  # required device manager config
  alias = '1'
  dev_class = 'swipe'
  driver = 'magtek.usbcardswipe.swipe'
  # specific config
  vendor_id = 0x0801
  product_id = 0x0002

This instructs the device layer's manager to create a device

  /dev/swipe/magtekusb/1

This is assigned the alias:

  /dev/swipe/1

The device manager loads the driver 'magtek.usb.swipe' from the drivers 
directory. The device layer looks from a Device class in the module. In the 
magtek example this would be 'magtek.usb.swipe.Device'. This class 
implements the required interface the manager uses to control the device.
