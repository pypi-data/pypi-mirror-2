What is GNU MediaGoblin?
========================

* Initially, a place to store all your photos that’s as awesome as, if
  not more awesome than, existing network services (Flickr, SmugMug,
  Picasa, etc)
* Later, a place for all sorts of media, such as video, music, etc hosting.
* Federated with OStatus!
* Customizable!
* A place for people to collaborate and show off original and derived
  creations. Free, as in freedom. We’re a GNU project in the making,
  afterall.


Is it ready for me to use?
==========================

Not yet!  We're working on it and we hope to have a usable system by
September / October 2011.


Can I help/hang out/participate/whisper sweet nothings in your ear?
