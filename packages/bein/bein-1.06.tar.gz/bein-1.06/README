Bein is a workflow manager and miniature LIMS system built in the
Bionformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility of the EPFL.  It fills
the gap for the working scientist between the classical shell and big
workflow managers like KNIME or Galaxy and major LIMS systems like
OpenBIS.

Installation
------------

You will need to have Python >= 2.5 installed on your system.  Some of the functions in bein.utils require numpy, matplotlib, pytables, and pysam, but will simply be unavailable if those libraries are not installed.

To install bein, in the bein directory, run

$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install


Known issues
------------

None

Acknowledgements
----------------

The development of bein was supported by The Bioinformatics and
Biostatistics Core Facility of the EPFL (http://bbcf.epfl.ch/) and

Features to add someday
-----------------------

* A MiniLIMS based on PostgreSQL for scaling up MiniLIMS repositories.
* A fancier MiniLIMS client.
* Refactor bein.util into submodules based on domain.
