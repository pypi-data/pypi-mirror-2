Description: cromlech.container
        ******************
        
        This package defines interfaces of container components, and provides
        a basic container implementation. The available component is a generic
        and non-persistent ccontainer.
        
        The package also provides some utilities to handle containers :
        an implementation of a `zope.size.ISized` component and an
        implementation of a `zope.location.ISublocations` component. They can
        both be registered as adapters, but `cromlech.container` doesn't do it
        by default.
        
        This package is the fruit of a fork from `zope.container`, in order to
        free it from the heavy zope dependencies and from the C
        module. Therefore, the behavior is different : the ContainedProxy
        component does not allow a transparent persistency.
