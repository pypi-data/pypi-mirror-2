Description: Introduction

        The following features for raptus.article are provided by this package:
        
        Fields
        ------
            * Option to hide the portlet columns
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
            * raptus.article.core
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.hidecolumns into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.hidecolumns add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.hidecolumns on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.hidecolumns
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.hidecolumns either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Edit your article. You will now have two new options in the "settings" tab:
        
            * Hide left portlet slot
            * Hide right portlet slot
        
        If you select one of them the selected column will be hidden.
