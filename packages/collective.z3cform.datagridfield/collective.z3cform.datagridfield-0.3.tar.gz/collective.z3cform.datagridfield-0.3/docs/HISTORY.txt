Changelog
=========

0.3 (2011-02-04)
----------------

    * The auto-append functionality did not bind correctly for popup forms.
      I switched to using jQuery.live() instead of binding at document load time.

    * Added a menu to the demo pages

    * Added a display only form option.

    * Fixed the restructured text of the main README.txt so that it will show
      more friendly in PyPI.
