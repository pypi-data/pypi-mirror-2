Using pymnl With Python 2
-------------------------

Recommend Using b'' For Strings
-------------------------------
To help you remember that strings are treated as 8-bit (non-unicode), use
the b'' decoration on strings headed for Netlink.  If you want to hardcode
the genl family name nl80211 in your script, using b'nl80211' should
highlight the type of the string.  While this is not vital in Py2, it will
make it easier to transfer your code to Py3 in the future.


Attr Expects 8-bit Strings
--------------------------
Attr.new_strnz() and Attr.new_strz() expect an 8-bit (non-unicode) string.
Because this is the default type for Py2 strings, no special considerations
are required, but it is recommended to use the b'' decoration as shown
above.


Examples Use __future__ print()
-------------------------------
To be compatible with Py2 and Py3, the example scripts in ./examples/ use
the new print function included starting in Python 2.6.  I.E.

        from __future__ import print_function

While the library should work with Python versions greater than 2.1, the
examples, as written, require at least Python 2.6.
