= INSTALL =

The pymnl distribution uses the Python stdlib distutils for packaging. To
install pymnl with the rest of the Python packages on your system, type

{{{
    python ./setup.py install
}}}

If you are more comfortable with GNU make, the following command does the
same as above:

{{{
    make install
}}}
