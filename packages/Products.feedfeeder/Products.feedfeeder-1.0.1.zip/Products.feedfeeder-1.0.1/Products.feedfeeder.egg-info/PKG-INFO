Description: Feedfeeder
        ==========
        
        Feedfeeder has just a few things it needs to do:
        
        - Read in a few ATOM feeds (not too many).
        
        - Create FeedFeederItems out of the entries pulled from the ATOM feeds.
        Any feed items that contain enclosures will have the enclosures
        pulled down and added as File items to the feed item.
        
        - This means figuring out which items are new, which also means having
        a good ID generating mechanism.
        
        
        Wait, no existing product?
        --------------------------
        
        There's a whole slew of RSS/ATOM reading products for zope and
        plone. None of them seemed to be a good fit. There was only one
        product that actually stored the entries in the zope database, but
        that was aimed at a lot of users individually adding a lot of feeds,
        so it needed either a separate ZEO process (old version) or a
        standalone mysql database (new version).
        
        All the other products didn't store the entries in the database, were
        old/unmaintained/etc.
        
        In a sense, we're using an existing product as we use Mark Pilgrim's
        excellent feedparser (http://feedparser.org) that'll do the actual
        ATOM reading for us.
        
        
        Product name
        ------------
        
        The product feeds the content of ATOM feeds to plone as document/file
        content types. So "feedfeeder" sort of suggested itself as a funny
        name. Fun is important :-)
        
        
        Product structure
        -----------------
        
        I'm using archgenxml to generate the boiler plate stuff. There's a
        'generate.sh' shell script that'll call archgenxml for you. Nothing
        fancy.
        
        The feedfeeder's content types are:
        - folder.FeedfeederFolder
        - item.FeedFeederItem
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        A feedfeeder is a folder which contains all the previously-added feed
        entries as documents or files. It has a 'feeds' attribute that
        contains a list of feeds to read.
        
        Feedparser is called periodically (through a cron job?) to parse the
        feeds. The UID of the items in the feed are converted to a suitable
        filename (md5 hex hash of the atom id of the entry), that way you can
        detect whether there are new items.
        
        New items are turned into feed items.
        
        Scheduled updates for feed folders
        
        Zope can be configured to periodically trigger a url call.
        In zope.conf you can use the <clock-server> directive to define a schedule and url
        with the following data::
        
        <clock-server>
        method /path_to_feedfolder/update_feed_items
        period 3600 # seconds
        user admin
        password 123
        host localhost:8080
        </clock-server>
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        - Works with Plone 2.5, 3.0 or 3.1.
        
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        The look-here-first test is the doctest at 'doc/feedfeeder-integration.txt'.
        
        Testing is best done with zope's zopectl. ::
        
        bin/zopectl test -s Products.feedfeeder'.
        
        
        
        History of feedfeeder
        =====================
        
        1.0.1 (2010-04-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix errors when viewing a folder or item on Plone 4, while still
        keeping Plone 2.5 and Plone 3 compatibility.
        Refs http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/25
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2009-12-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Some summaries are a snippet from the full content, and then they
        can contain broken html; in this case we are now saving the raw
        broken html, parsing it only when possible.
        [lucmult]
        
        
        1.0rc7 (2009-11-06)
        -------------------
        
        - Improved the translations stuffs
        [lucmult]
        
        - Changed the way to translate xml/html entities from summary, now
        using BeautifulSoup. Old way was breaking with some non ascii
        characters.
        [lucmult]
        
        - When setting the text of a feed item during updating, store the
        mimetype as well if it is a supported one.
        Refs http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/24
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0rc6 (2009-09-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Bug fix: curly quotes getting mangled when Descriptions are built.
        Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/7
        (Merged branch maurits-cleaner-entityrefs-in-description.)
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0rc5 (2009-07-02)
        -------------------
        
        - Do not add our skin layer to Plone Default and certainly not to
        Plone Tableless, but just to all (*).  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0rc4 (2009-06-18)
        -------------------
        
        - When both the updated and published date of an item is not known,
        take today as the date when first adding it.  When updating, do not
        change the original item.
        Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/21
        [maurits]
        
        - Read tags/categories/keywords of feed items and store them on the
        created content item.  No Archetypes field, just a simple getter and
        setter called feed_tags.   Idea: Robin Harms Oredsson.
        [maurits]
        
        - DateTime.SyntaxError is thrown with some very common US
        Daylight Saving zones, such as EDT. We now wrap the DateTime parsing
        of feeds, to try to recognise those zones before politely giving up, using
        maurits' fix, below.
        [russf]
        
        - Catch DateTime.SyntaxError when parsing the updated and published
        dates of an entry and continue with the next entry.
        Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/18
        [maurits]
        
        - Avoid swallowing too much exceptions when applying our GenericSetup
        profile.
        Fixes http://plone.org/products/feedfeeder/issues/19
        [maurits]
        
        1.0rc3 (2008-10-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved profile definition from python to GenericSetup.  Profile is
        now not 'profile-feedfeeder:default' but
        'profile-Products.feedfeeder:default'.  [maurits]
        
        - In the Extensions/ dir: removed Install.py and renamed AppInstall.py
        to install.py.  [maurits]
        
        - Made feed item updated date available for Collections/Smart Folders.
        [maurits]
        
        - Extensions/AppInstall.py: first try installing our own profile in
        the Plone 3 way and when that fails try the Plone 2.5 way.
        [maurits]
        
        - Removed own feedparser.py.  Instead added an install_requires
        dependency on FeedParser in setup.py.  [maurits]
        
        - Moved fix for feeds starting with 'feed:' instead of 'http:' from
        feedparser.py to utilities.py, so we use an unchanged feedparser.py
        again.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 rc 2 (2008-07-23)
        ---------------------
        
        - Re-release of rc1: rc1 was missing all .txt files, making install impossible
        as setup.py reads version.txt. [reinout]
        
        
        1.0 rc 1 (2008-07-15)
        ---------------------
        
        - Accept entries without a title, which is allowed in rss.
        See http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt
        [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 4 (2008-05-20)
        -----------------------
        
        - Eggification: you can now install it as the Products.feedfeeder
        egg.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 beta 3 (2008-05-13)
        -----------------------
        
        - In the tests, use plone_workflow explicitly, so it is easier to test
        on both Plone 2.5 and 3.0.  [maurits]
        
        - Make update_feed_items available in the object_buttons for Plone 3,
        using new small @@is_feedcontainer as condition.  [maurits]
        
        - Avoid deprecation warnings for events and interfaces.  [maurits]
        
        - Remove semicolon in page template that broke in Plone 3.  [maurits]
        
        - Fix imports so they work in Plone 3 as well, without deprecation
        warnings.  [derstappenit]
        
        
        1.0 beta 2 (2008-01-02)
        -----------------------
        
        - History begins.
