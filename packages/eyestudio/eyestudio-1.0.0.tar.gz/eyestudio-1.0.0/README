Eye Studio

---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a tool to analyse eye movement classification algorithms. The
tool was developed as part of the thesis work done by Gustav Larsson
in 2010.

Requirements:
 - NumPy
 - PyQt (for GUI)
 - matplotlib (for GUI)

Analyses that directly use the API can be made with only NumPy
installed.

DISCLAIMER
The goal of this program was mainly to make it able to perform the
analysis in my thesis. It does not give user-friendly error messages
if the data files were not arranged in the correct ways, and if you
as a new user want to use this program, do not be afraid of opening
up the source code to understand what is going on.

GETTING STARTED
There is a folder Testfiles/ with example tsv, npz and stimulus 
files. Run eyestudio.py and open them through the GUI. Now, if
you want to make your own algorithm, I suggest copying one of the
existing files in Filters/, rename it, and start playing around. The
same should be done for new metrics.

ANALYSING DATA
There are a files in Analysis/ that were used to arrange and analyse
data. Use them or simply look at them as inspiration how you can interact with the API to create your own analyses. Remember that
these files were originally in the root, so they should be moved
here before they are used.

CLEARVIEW and TOBII FIXATION FILTER
These implementations are mentioned in the thesis, but they are not
made publicly available. This is by request from Tobii Technology.
