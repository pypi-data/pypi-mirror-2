        bda.zeopack
        ===========
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Packs one or more databases/ storages on one or more ZEO-Servers (Zope Database
        Storages on Zope Enterprise Objects Server).
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Tested with eggs releaes of ZODB2 >=3.8 and Zope 2.9, 2.10 (latest) as
        tgz-release.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install it using ``easy_install`` or ``zc.buildout``. Example for zc.buildout::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = zeopack
        
        [zeopack]
        recipe = repoze.recipe.egg:scripts
        eggs = bda.zeopack
        
        If youre using Zope with a version below 2.11 (like 2.10 or 2.9) the buildout
        gets a bit more complex::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = zope zeopack
        
        [zope]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install
        url = http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.9.11/Zope-2.9.11-final.tgz
        # url = http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.10.9/Zope-2.10.9-final.tgz
        fake-zope-eggs = true
        additional-fake-eggs = ZEO
        
        [zeopack]
        recipe = repoze.recipe.egg:scripts
        eggs = bda.zeopack
        initialization = sys.path.append('${zope:location}/lib/python')
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Create a configuration file. If no location is given as first argument
        bda.zeopack consider the file at ``/etc/zeopack.cfg``.
        
        The format of the file follows Python ConfigParser format. It looks like::
        
        [MY.DOMAIN.TLD_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT]
        day = NUMBER_OF_DAYS_TO_KEEP
        storages =
        STORAGENAME
        STORAGENAME
        
        Example::
        
        [127.0.0.1:8100]
        days = 1
        storages =
        storage1
        storage2
        storage4
        
        [127.0.0.1:8200]
        days = 7
        storages =
        project1
        project2
        
        [storage.bluedynamics.com:8100]
        days = 1
        storages =
        root1
        mountr1m1
        mountr1m2
        root2
        mountr2m1
        ...
        
        Todo:
        =====
        
        * better parsing of argv
        * support authentication
        * pipe file via stdin instead of filename
