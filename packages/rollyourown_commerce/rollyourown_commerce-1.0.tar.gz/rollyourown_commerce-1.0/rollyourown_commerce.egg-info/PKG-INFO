Description: 
        Roll Your Own is a series of frameworks that help Django developers have their
        perfection by rolling their own apps instead of plugging someone else's.  Each
        framework promotes customised, modular and efficient ecommerce apps.
        
        Philosophy
        
            * use frameworks and tools, not apps
            * write highly customised apps/sites
            * live only in the now, write for today's requirements
            * avoid using apps that have fixed opinions/decisions
            * developer free to have/make their own opinions/decisions 
        
        Django itself does exactly that, but many of the "reusable apps" that are 
        developed on top of django don't continue this philosophy
