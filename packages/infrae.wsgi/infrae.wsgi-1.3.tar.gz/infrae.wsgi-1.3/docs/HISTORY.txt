Changes
=======

1.3 (2011-07-27)
----------------

- Improve logging.

- BadRequest and Forbidden exceptions are now ignored by default in
  the logs.

- Fix a bug the original CONTENT_LENGTH header is empty.

- When an error happens on an IBrowserPage, use the page's context
  when handling the error (to prevent falling back to the nearest Site)

1.2 (2011-02-02)
----------------

- Add a view ``debugzope.html`` that display a dump of the server
  threads. You need to be manager to access it.

- You can from the ``errorlog.html`` configure the error you wish to
  ignore (not log). This is a non persistent setting.

- Handle buggy PAS unauthorized plugins, by catching any error, and
  logging them. In case of problem, a basic 401 response is sent back.

- Add the ZPublisher *insertBase* functionality: if a base is set by
  the request, and we render HTML, with an HEAD tag and no BASE tag,
  insert a BASE tag with the value provided by the request. This fix
  broken ZMI screens.

1.1 (2010-10-07)
----------------

- Fix a bug where `Content-Length` is not set and cannot be set.

- Correctly encode payload when needed before sending it (if it was a
  unicode string).

- Error codes less when 500 triggers a commit now, this let you
  support login pages that uses a Zope session ID.

- Add some hooks in the testing code to be more extensible (used for
  `infrae.testbrowser`).

1.0 (2010-07-15)
----------------

- Initial release.
