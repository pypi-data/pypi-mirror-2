django-postal
============

A django application that provides a location agnostic model for postal addresses.

The motivation behind this project is that most countries have different forms of
postal addresses e.g. http://www.bitboost.com/ref/international-address-formats.html , 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_%28geography%29

This app assumes that all postal addresses worldwide can be made up of 5 optional
address lines plus a country code.

It then localizes the title of each line dependant on the country selected.
Further information on each address line can be gleaned from 
django.contrib.localflavor fields and widgets e.g. for the UK

from django import forms
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from django.contrib.localflavor.uk.forms import UKPostcodeField, UKCountySelect

from postal.forms import PostalAddressForm

class GBPostalAddressForm(PostalAddressForm):
    line1 = forms.CharField(label=_(u"Company name"), required=False, max_length=50)
    line2 = forms.CharField(label=_(u"Street"), max_length=50)
    city = forms.CharField(label=_(u"Town"), max_length=50)
    state = forms.CharField(label=_(u"County"), widget=UKCountySelect, max_length=50)
    code = UKPostcodeField(label=_(u"Postcode"))

It is hoped that various contributors will contribute address formats per country
and that eventually this address information could find it's way back in to
django.contrib.localflavor


Dependencies
============

django-countries (http://code.google.com/p/django-countries/)


Developers, How to Contribute
==========
$ git clone git@github.com:mthornhill/django-postal.git
$ cd django-postal
$ virtualenv . --no-site-packages
$ source bin/activate
$ python bootstrap.py
$ bin/buildout -v
$ bin/django syncdb
$ bin/test
$ bin/django runserver

browse to http://localhost:8000

new countries can be added to the src/postal folder by their 
2 letter country code e.g. us

Each country folder contains an __init__.py and a forms.py
forms.py contains the localized address

Usage
=====

1. Add django-countries and django-postal to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
e.g.

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    "countries",
    "postal",
    ...
    )

2. In your view code import the code for getting a localized postal address

views.py
from postal.views import get_postal_form_class

form_class = get_postal_form_class("us")
postal_form = form_class()

3. Add postal_form to your templates

some_template.html
{{postal_form}}

4. In this case we will have a US postal form



TODO 

1. Create method of allowning third party app to register a localized postal form
	a) Registry match with regular expressions cf urls.py
	b) admin site approach
	
2. Templatetag for modifying a form in a template
	e.g. {{postal_form|localize:country_code}}
