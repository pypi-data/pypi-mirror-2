        This pure-python package is designed to be a standard implementation of performance curves
        and metrics for use either in python scripts or through a simple commandline interface.
        
        With this package, one can easily:
        
        #. Compute the coordinates of both Accumulation Curves and ROC curves.
        #. Handle ties appropriately using several methods.
        #. Compute the BEDROC metric.
        #. Vertically add and average the performance curves of several cross-validation folds.
        #. Focus on the early part of the ROC curve by using several soon to be published x-axis transforms.
