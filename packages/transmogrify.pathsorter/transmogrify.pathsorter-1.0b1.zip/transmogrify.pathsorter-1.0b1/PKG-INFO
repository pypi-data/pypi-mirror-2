Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        If items are at the same level in a folder then they will be sorted based on a
        '_sortorder' key as given by transmogrify.webcrawler.
        
        In addition
        
        - if an item doesn't exist for a given items parent it will be created. The _type key will
        be set to the first item in 'default_containers'.
        
        - if a container has a 'text' key then a default page will be created.
        
        - if item's name is in 'default_pages' and it's parent doesn't already have a defaultpage
        then the item will be set as the parents default page.
