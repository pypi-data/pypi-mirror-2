0.7.0 (2011-06-07)
------------------

- Fix tests using a newer zope.publisher that requires zope.login.
- Fix tests by not using deprecated ``zope.app.securitypolicy``
- Remove test dependency ``zope.app.server`` and ``zope.app.authentication``.
  Use ``zope.password`` instead.
- No longer using deprecated ``zope.testing.doctestunit``. Use python's
  build-in ``doctest`` instead.


0.6.4 (2009-10-20)
------------------

- Make Calendar pop-up and drag behavior more consistent across
  browser modes in IE.


0.6.3 (2009-08-24)
------------------

- Fixed handling of naive datetime objects, they no longer result in
  an exception but are displayed unchanged. When they get saved again
  they are saved with UTC timezone like all other ones.

- Added `datetimewidget.txt` doctest to ``long_description`` to show
  up on pypi home page.

- Fixed home page name in `setup.py`.

- Added coverage analysis tools to buildout.

0.6.2 (2009-05-20)
------------------

- Using `++resource++` instead of `@@/` to load resources.

- Renaming "lang" directory (``ZPublisher`` gets confused because of a
  view with the same name exists in ``zope.traversing.namespace``).

  See `gocept.datetimewidget`_ for more details on how to use
  zc.datetimewidget with zope2.
