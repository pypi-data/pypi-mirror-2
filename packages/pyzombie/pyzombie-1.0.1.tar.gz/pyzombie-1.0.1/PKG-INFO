Description: ========
        pyzombie
        ========
        
        This is an HTTP RESTful server that will allow arbitrary code to
        be executed on a remote host. The principle purpose is to allow
        test code to be loaded and executed remotely on hosts for systems
        that have no direct network presence.
        
        
        .. WARNING::
            Executing pyzombie on any machine will open it up to all attacks
            by anyone or anything that has access to the internet (TCP/IP)
            address and port. There is no security within pyzombie to prevent
            unauthorized access.
