Description: *******************************
        Download recipe for Selenium RC
        *******************************
        
        This package downloads and installs Selenium RC using zc.buildout. It is based
        on hexagonit.recipe.download.
        
        buildout.cfg example::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = seleniumrc
        
        [seleniumrc]
        recipe = collective.recipe.seleniumrc
        
        A control script will be created based on the part name. In this case a
        control script will be created in bin/seleniumrc
        
        You may also be interested in the selenium module for Python which allows you
        to control Selenium RC.

        You can also choose the exact version of Selenium RC to be used::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = seleniumrc
        
        [seleniumrc]
        recipe = collective.recipe.seleniumrc
        url = http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0.1/selenium-remote-control-1.0.1-dist.zip
        md5sum = 068b1adb26a7450717e6d6d67e261b58
        
        Sometimes you may want to use another Java executable::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = seleniumrc
        
        [seleniumrc]
        recipe = collective.recipe.seleniumrc
        java-cmd = /home/www/java/bin/java
