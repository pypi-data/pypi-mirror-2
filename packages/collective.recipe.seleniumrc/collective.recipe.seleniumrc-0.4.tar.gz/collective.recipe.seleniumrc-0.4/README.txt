Download recipe for Selenium RC
*******************************

This package downloads and installs Selenium RC using zc.buildout. It is based
on hexagonit.recipe.download.

buildout.cfg example::

  [buildout]
  parts = seleniumrc

  [seleniumrc]
  recipe = collective.recipe.seleniumrc

A control script will be created based on the part name. In this case a
control script will be created in bin/seleniumrc

You may also be interested in the selenium module for Python which allows you
to control Selenium RC.

You can also choose the exact version of Selenium RC to be used::

  [buildout]
  parts = seleniumrc

  [seleniumrc]
  recipe = collective.recipe.seleniumrc
  url = http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/1.0.1/selenium-remote-control-1.0.1-dist.zip
  md5sum = 068b1adb26a7450717e6d6d67e261b58

Sometimes you may want to use another Java executable::

  [buildout]
  parts = seleniumrc

  [seleniumrc]
  recipe = collective.recipe.seleniumrc
  java-cmd = /home/www/java/bin/java
