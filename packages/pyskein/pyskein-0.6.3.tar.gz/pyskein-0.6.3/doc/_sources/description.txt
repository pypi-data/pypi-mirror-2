PySkein is an extension module for Python 3.0 or later,
implementing the `Skein hash algorithm`_, one of the Second
Round Candidates in the `NIST SHA-3 Competition`_. While
originally based on the optimized version of the reference
implementation by Doug Whiting, PySkein has since evolved into a
feature-rich and pythonic module. It is released as free
software under the `GNU General Public License`_. Its highlights
are:

* A simple **interface** following the hash algorithms in the
  Python standard library (like `hashlib.sha1` or
  `hashlib.sha256`)

* Many **features** of the Skein specification (such as tree
  hashing, various parameters and output sizes etc.)

* High hashing **performance** through efficient C implementation
  (7.1 cycles/byte for sequential hashing and 4.2 cycles/byte
  for tree hashing on two cores, measured on an Athlon 64 X2)

* **Threefish**, the tweakable block cipher used in Skein,
  available for encrytion and decryption on its own
