PySkein 0.3.1
=============

PySkein is an extension module for Python 3.0 or later providing the Skein hash
algorithms (c.f. `Skein website <http://www.skein-hash.info/>`_).  It is based
on the optimized version of the reference implementation written in C by Doug
Whiting, allowing efficient hash computations.  (On a 2.8 GHz Opteron I get a
hashing performance of 373 MB/s for Skein-512-512 as called from Python.)
