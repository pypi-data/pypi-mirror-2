PySkein 0.3
-----------

PySkein provides the family of Skein hashing algorithms in a Python module.
I wrote it mainly to teach myself how to write Python extension modules,
and to enable convenient experimentation with and analysis of these
recently proposed algorithms.  (For information on Skein, see
http://www.schneier.com/skein.html)
