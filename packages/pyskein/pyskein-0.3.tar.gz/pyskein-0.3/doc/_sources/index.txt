PySkein 0.3
===========

PySkein is an extension module for Python 3.0 or higher
providing the recently proposed Skein hash algorithms
(c.f. `Skein website <http://www.schneier.com/skein.html>`_).
It is based on the optimized version of the reference implementation
written in C by Doug Whiting, allowing efficient hash computations.
(On a 2.8 GHz Opteron I get a hashing performance of 373 MB/s
for Skein-512-512 as called from Python.)
