PySkein 0.5.1
-------------

PySkein provides the family of recently proposed Skein hashing algorithms as a
Python module.  For more information on Skein, please visit its homepage at
http://www.skein-hash.info/


Notes about previous versions
-----------------------------

- If you have a version of PySkein <0.5 installed, please make sure to manually
  delete "skein.*" from your Python "site-packages" directory before
  installation!

- All versions of PySkein <0.5 compute Skein hashes according to an older
  specification of Skein (version 1.1). Starting with PySkein 0.5, hashes are
  computed according to the current and incompatible specification
  (version 1.2).


Installation
------------

You need Python 3.0 or later to run PySkein! To install globally run (with
appropriate permissions):

python3 setup.py install

To install locally (e.g. into your home directory) run:

python3 setup.py install --user

The setup script will also install the two demo scripts "skeinsum" and
"threefish" into a corresponding location.
