PySkein 0.5.1
=============

PySkein is an extension module for Python 3.0 or later, allowing Python scripts
to compute hash values with the recently proposed `Skein hash algorithm`_ (one
of the Second Round Candidates in the `NIST SHA-3 Competition`_).  It is based
on the optimized version of the Skein reference implementation, written in C by
Doug Whiting. This guarantees efficient hashing (373 MB/s for Skein-512-512
called from Python on a 2.8 GHz Opteron).
