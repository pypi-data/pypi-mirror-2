2.13.2 (2010-04-04)
-------------------

- Give both wrapper classes a ``__getnewargs__`` method, which causes the ZODB
  optimization to fail and create persistent references using the ``_p_oid``
  alone. This happens to be the persistent oid of the wrapped object. This lets
  these objects to be persisted correctly, even though they are passed to the
  ZODB in a wrapped state.

- Added failing tests for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10318. This shows
  an edge-case where AQ wrappers can be pickled using the specific combination
  of cPickle, pickle protocol one and a custom Pickler class with an
  ``inst_persistent_id`` hook. Unfortunately this is the exact combination used
  by ZODB3.

2.13.1 (2010-02-23)
-------------------

- Update to include ExtensionClass 2.13.0.

- Fix the ``tp_name`` of the ImplicitAcquisitionWrapper and
  ExplicitAcquisitionWrapper to match their Python visible names and thus have
  a correct ``__name__``.

- Expand the ``tp_name`` of our extension types to hold the fully qualified
  name. This ensures classes have their ``__module__`` set correctly.

2.13.0 (2010-02-14)
-------------------

- Added support for method cache in Acquisition. Patch contributed by
  Yoshinori K. Okuji. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/486182.

2.12.4 (2009-10-29)
-------------------

- Fix iteration proxying to pass `self` acquisition-wrapped into both
  `__iter__` as well as `__getitem__` (this fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/360761).

- Add tests for the __getslice__ proxying, including open-ended slicing.

2.12.3 (2009-08-08)
-------------------

- More 64-bit fixes in Py_BuildValue calls.

- More 64-bit issues fixed: Use correct integer size for slice operations.

2.12.2 (2009-08-02)
-------------------

- Fixed 64-bit compatibility issues for Python 2.5.x / 2.6.x.  See 
  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/ for details.

2.12.1 (2009-04-15)
-------------------

- Update for iteration proxying: The proxy for `__iter__` must not rely on the
  object to have an `__iter__` itself, but also support fall-back iteration via
  `__getitem__` (this fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/360761).

2.12 (2009-01-25)
-----------------

- Release as separate package.
