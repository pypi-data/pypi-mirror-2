Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The theme editor makes it possible to customize most aspects of a plone theme from a single location.
        After installation a new entry is added to the Plone "site setup" control panel called "Theme Editor."
        
        Using the themeeditor
        -----------------------
        
        1. Log into your Plone site as a Manager
        2. Navigate to Site Setup
        3. Select Theme Editor

        Installation
        ============
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``plone.app.themeeditor`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        plone.app.themeeditor
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        plone.app.themeeditor
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        Plone 3 notes
        -------------
        
        You will need to pin newer versions of plone.app.customerize and
        plone.app.jquerytools as shown below::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        versions = versions
        
        [versions]
        plone.app.jquerytools = 1.1.2
        plone.app.customerize = 1.2
        
        Important: the versions noted here were correct at the time of release (Plone 3.3.5).
        If you are using a newer version of Plone 3.x which requires a newer version of
        plone.app.jquerytools or plone.app.customerize there is no need to pin them in the
        version section.
