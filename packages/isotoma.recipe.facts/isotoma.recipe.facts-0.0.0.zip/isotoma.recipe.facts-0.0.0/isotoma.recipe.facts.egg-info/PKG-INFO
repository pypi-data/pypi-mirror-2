Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides information about the host you are running buildout on.
        
        
        Exposed Parameters
        ==================
        
        hostname
        The hostname of the machine buildout is running on, as returned by ``socket.gethostname()``
        fqdn
        The fully qualified domain of the machine buildout is running on, as return by ``socket.getfqdn()``.
        If no fqdn is available, this will be the same as hostname.
        interface.X.address
        The IP address of the network interface ``X``.
        
        
        Using facts
        ===========
        
        This example uses the missingbits echo recipe to print information about the current machine::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = echo
        
        [facts]
        recipe = isotoma.recipe.facts
        
        [echo]
        recipe = missingbits:echo
        echo =
        The hostname is ${facts:hostname}
        The fdqn is ${facts:fdqn}
        The main IP address is ${facts:interface.eth0.address}
