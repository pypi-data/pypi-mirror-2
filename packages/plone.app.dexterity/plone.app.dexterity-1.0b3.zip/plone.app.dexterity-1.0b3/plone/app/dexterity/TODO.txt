issues:
[ ] should make sure model isn't serialized multiple times
  - queue changes in session?
[ ] need a decoupled way to tweak things like form titles

general:
[ ] docs
- tests
 [ ] roadrunner
 [ ] doctests for basic walkthrough
[ ] i18n infrastructure (use message factory from plone.dexterity?)
[ ] make sure plone.schemaeditor can be used by some other product like PFG
 - need to be able to override form template, mutate form fields

schema editor:
- functionality:
 [ ] rename type
 [ ] handle widget selection
 [ ] fieldsets -- including integration with behaviors (weighting?)
 [ ] editing dexterity metadata like permissions

design issues:
- UI design for managing multiple fieldsets / schemata
- figure out what to do about vocabularies
- figure out what to do about Choice item types

examples / dogfooding / things to test:
- build a geolocation behavior
- handling of pre-existing content
