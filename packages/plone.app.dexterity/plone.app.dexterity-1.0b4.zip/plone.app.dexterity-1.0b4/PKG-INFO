Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package integrates the Dexterity_ content type system into the Plone_
        content management system.
        
        .. _Dexterity: http://plone.org/products/dexterity
        .. _Plone: http://plone.org
        
        plone.app.dexterity contains code to handle four major areas of concern:
        
        * Dexterity Types control panel
        * Default behaviors
        * Installation of dependencies
        * Backports of several upstream changes
        
        
        Dexterity Types control panel
        -----------------------------
        
        Installing this package adds a control panel called "Dexterity Content Types".
        This control panel allows you to:
        
        * Add and remove Dexterity content types
        * Modify the schema of a Dexterity content type
        * Assign behaviors to a Dexterity content type
        
        
        Default behaviors
        -----------------
        
        Several behaviors are included that can be enabled for a content type to make
        it behave similarly to a standard ATContentTypes-based content type.  These
        behaviors can be enabled via the Behaviors tab for a type in the Dexterity
        Types control panel, or via the behaviors setting on the type's FTI in
        portal_types in the ZMI.
        
        Dublin Core metadata (plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IDublinCore)
        This behavior includes the standard Dublin Core metadata fields.  Enabling
        it is equivalent to enabling the Basic Metadata, Categorization, Effective
        Range, and Ownership behaviors.
        
        Basic Metadata (plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IBasic)
        Includes title and description fields.
        
        Categorization (plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.ICategorization)
        Includes subject and language fields.
        
        Effective Range (plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IPublication)
        Includes effective date and expiration date fields.
        
        Ownership (plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IOwnership)
        Includes creator, contributor, and copyright fields.
        
        Related Items (plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.related.IRelatedItems)
        Includes a z3c.relationfield-based related items field.
        
        Name From Title (plone.app.content.interfaces.INameFromTitle)
        Items with this behavior enabled will automatically get an id based on their
        title when the item is saved for the first time.
        
        
        Installation of dependencies
        ----------------------------
        
        Installing this package should also install everything else that you need to
        use Dexterity within Plone.  In particular, it will pull in the following
        packages as dependencies:
        
        * z3c.form
        * plone.z3cform
        * plone.app.z3cform
        * plone.supermodel
        * plone.dexterity
        * plone.directives.form
        * plone.directives.dexterity
        * plone.schemaeditor
        * plone.formwidget.autocomplete
        * plone.formwidget.contenttree
        * plone.app.relationfield
        
        
        Backports of upstream changes
        -----------------------------
        
        Dexterity relies on several new features in CMF_ and plone.app.content that
        are not included in existing Plone 3.x releases:
        
        * The ability to specify an expression for the add view on an FTI.
        * The ability to traverse to an add view in the ++add++ namespace.
        * Building the type factory menu based on actions.
        
        .. _CMF: http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF
        
        plone.app.dexterity applies these changes as monkey patches so that Dexterity
        can be used in Plone 3.x.  See overrides.zcml and overrides.py for details.

        http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=126
        [vangheem]

        * Avoid relying on acquisition to get the portal_url for links in the type
        listing table.
        [davisagli]
        
        
        1.0a7 - 2010-01-08
        ------------------

        1.0a6 - 2009-10-12
        ------------------
        
        * Add plone.app.textfield as a dependency. We don't use it directly in this
        package, but users of Dexterity should have it installed and available.
        [optilude]
        
        * Use some default icons for new types.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Show type icons in type listing if available.

        * Removed 'container' field from the types listing in the control panel
        (it wasn't working).
        [davisagli]
        
        * Add message factories to titles and descriptions of metadata schema fields.
        Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=75.
        [optilude]
        
        * Patch listActionInfos() instead of listActions() in order to get the
        folder/add category into the actions list. This avoids a problem with
        the 'actions.xml' export handler exporting the folder/add category
        incorrectly. Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=78
        [optilude]
        
        1.0a5 - 2009-07-26
        ------------------
        
        * Explicitly include overrides.zcml from plone.app.z3cform.
        [optilude]
        
        1.0a4 - 2009-07-12
        ------------------
        
        * Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
        the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
        apologies, but it's now or never. :-/
        
        If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
        code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. serialize_schema()
        becomes serializeSchema().
        [optilude]
        
        1.0a3 (2009-06-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Updated use of <plone:behavior /> directive to match plone.behavior 1.0b4.
        [optilude]
        
        1.0a2 (2009-06-01)
        ------------------
        
        * Remove superfluous <includeOverrides /> in configure.zcml which would cause
        a problem when the package is loaded via z3c.autoinclude.plugin
        [optilude]
        
        1.0a1 - (2009-05-27)
        --------------------
        
        * Initial release
