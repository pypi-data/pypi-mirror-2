Description: Overview
        --------
        
        Mezzanine is a content management platform built using the `Django`_ framework. It is BSD licenced and designed to provide both a consistant interface for managing content, and a simple archtiecture that makes diving in and hacking on the code as easy as possible.
        
        Its goal is to resemble something like `Wordpress`_, with an intuitive interface for managing pages and blog posts. Mezzanine takes a different approach from a lot of other Django applications in this space like `Pinax`_ or `Mingus`_ that glue together a lot of reusable apps, instead opting to provide most of its functionality included with the project by default.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Apart from `Django`_ itself, Mezzanine has no explicit dependencies but is designed to be used most effectively in conjunction with the following libraries.
        
        * `setuptools`_
        * `Python Imaging Library`_ (PIL)
        * `django-grappelli`_ <= 2.0
        * `django-filebrowser`_
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Assuming you have `setuptools`_ installed, the easiest method is to install directly from Pypi by running the following command, which will also attempt to install the dependencies mentioned above::
        
        $ easy_install -U mezzanine
        
        Otherwise you can download Mezzanine and install it directly from source::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        Once installed the command ``mezzanine-project`` should be available which can be for creating a new Mezzaine project in a similar fashion to ``django-admin.py``::
        
        $ mezzanine-project project_name
