Description: pyShipping provides connections to interface with shipping companies and to transport shipping related information.
        
        * package - shipping/cargo related calculations based on a unit of shipping (box, crate, package), includes
        a bin packing implementation in pure Python
        * sendung - defines an abstract shippment (Sendung), with packages and calculations based on that
        * addressvalidation - check if an address is valid
        * carriers.dpd - calculation of DPD/Georoutes routing data and labels. Included tables are for shippments from Wuppertal but it should work with all other german routing tables.
        * fortras - tools for reading and writing Fortras messages. Fortras is a EDI standard for logistics related information somewhat common in Germany. See Wikipedia_ for further enlightenment
        
        .. _Wikipedia: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortras
        
        It also comes with the only python based `3D Bin Packing <http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/files/bin-packing.shtml>`_ implementation I'm aware of. The Algorithm has sufficient performance to be used in everyday shipping and warehousing applications.
