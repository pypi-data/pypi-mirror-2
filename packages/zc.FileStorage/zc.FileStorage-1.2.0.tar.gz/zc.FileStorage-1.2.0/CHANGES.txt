1.2.0 (1010-05-21)
==================

- Now (ZODB 3.10) that the filestorage packer option can take
  expressions, expose a packer factory, ``Packer``.

- In addition to a sleep argument, to control resting between
  transactions, provide transform and untransform options to provide
  record-transformation functions.  The primary use case for this is
  to use packing to compress storages not previously compressed.

1.1.0 (1010-03-10)
==================

- Improved use of posix_fadvise (where available)

- Provided an option to rest between transactions to try to avoid
  excessive stress on the storage server.

- Provided some progress logging (every GIG) in the pack log.

1.0.0 (2009-11-06)
==================

Updated to work with ZODB 3.9.

Removed GC support, since that is now provided by zc.zodbdgc.
