Description: ======================
        django-generic-helpers
        ======================
        
        This app provides some snippets (such as abstract models and managers
        with some useful methods) to simplyfy creation of another pluggable apps.
        
        The license is MIT.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install django-generic-helpers
        
        After you can add app 'generic_helpers' to your INSTALLED_APPS. If you aren't
        want to run test, you can skip this step.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To use this app, just import GenericRelationModel class from
        generic_helpers.models package and inherit your model from it:
        
            from django.db import models
            from generic_helpers.models import GenericRelationModel      
            
            class MyModel(GenericRelationModel):
                title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        
        Now MyModel class has content_object attribute and you can create MyModel
        instances using generic relation:
        
            >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
            >>> user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
            >>>
            >>> my_model = MyModel.objects.create(
            ...     title = 'title',
            ...     content_object = user,
            ... )
            >>>
        
        In this example how you can see we have used User. 
        
        Also your model manager has a get_for_object method for quick filtering by
        content_object complex field:
        
            >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
            >>> user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
            >>>
            >>> models_for_user = MyModel.objects.get_for_object(user)
            >>>
