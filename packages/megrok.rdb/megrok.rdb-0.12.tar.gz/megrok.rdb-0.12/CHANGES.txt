0.12 (2011-02-02)
-----------------

- Update dependencies and imports to work with Grok 1.2 and 1.3.


0.11 (2010-02-22)
-----------------

- Added a LICENSE.txt file.

- Added setupDatabaseSkipCreate. This allows setting up the database
  without trying to create any tables, just reflection.

0.10 (2009-09-18)
-----------------

- Added to SQLAlchemy to zope.schema adapters so that most of the types in
  sqlalchemy.types are covered.

- Import schema_from_model into ``megrok.rdb`` package namespace.

- Update buildout to use Grok 1.0b2 versions.

- Added a test that demonstrates a common initialization pattern using
  `rdb.setupDatabase`` in a ``IEngineCreatedEvent`` subscriber.

0.9.1 (2009-08-14)
------------------

- megrok.rdb 0.9 accidentally had zip_safe set to True, which resulted
  in a dud release as its ZCML wouldn't be loaded. Set zip_safe to
  False.

0.9 (2009-08-14)
----------------

- Initial public release.
