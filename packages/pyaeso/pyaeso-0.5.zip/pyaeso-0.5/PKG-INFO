Description: ======
        pyaeso
        ======
        
        ``pyaeso`` is a python package that makes access to the
        Alberta[, Canada,] Electric System Operator's (AESO) Energy Trading
        System (ETS) easier.
        
        The Alberta Electric Systems Operator (AESO) <http://www.aeso.ca>
        operates Alberta's deregulated electricity market.  AESO provides
        price, demand, and other valuable information through the publically
        accessible Energy Trading System (ETS) website <http://ets.aeso.ca>.
        This information is useful for economic analysis, power trading,
        electric system study, and electric system forecasting.  The first
        step in using such information is to download it and parse it into
        useful data structures - a task performed by this library.  Typically
        the data will feed statistical methods, heuristics, and system models
        to provide useful analysis of the Alberta electric system.
        
        The pyaeso project is hosted at <http://bitbucket.org/kc/pyaeso> and
        releases are made via the Python Package Index at
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyaeso>.  Online documentation is available
        at <http://packages.python.org/pyaeso>.
        
        
        Audience
        ========
        
        A basic knowledge of the Python programming language is required to
        use this library.  Python is an easy to learn, powerful language.  An
        excellent introductory tutorial is available at
        <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        * *Python 2.4 or better* - Available at <http://python.org/download>
        (2009-11-25).
        
        * *pytz* - "World timezone definitions, modern and historical".
        Available at <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz> (2009-11-14).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Extract the archive, enter the recovered directory and type:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Some code samples that use pyaeso are availble in the ``examples``
        directory.  One sample is listed here::
        
        >>> '''Print yesterday's market clearing price/demand points and exit.'''
        >>>
        >>> # Standard library imports
        >>> import sys
        >>> from StringIO import StringIO
        >>> import datetime
        >>>
        >>> # 3rd Party Libraries
        >>> from pyaeso import ets
        >>>
        >>> end_date = datetime.date.today()
        >>> start_date = end_date - datetime.timedelta(1)
        >>>
        >>> f = StringIO()
        >>> ets.dump_pool_price(f, start_date, end_date)
        >>> f.seek(0)
        >>> #print f.getvalue()
        >>> data = list(ets.parse_pool_price_file(f))
        >>> f.close()
        >>>
        >>> print '''Yesterday's market clearing price/demand points.'''
        >>> for d in data:
        >>>     print d.t.astimezone(ets.ALBERTA_TZ), '$' + str(d.price), str(d.demand) + 'MW'
        
        
        Known Incompatibilities
        =======================
        
        * *Python <= 2.3* - Fails because pyaeso uses several standard library
        modules that were introduced in Python 2.4.
        
        * *Python 3* - pyaeso uses the pytz package which has no Python 3
        version (2009-11-14).  The pyaeso library should be quickly available
        for Python 3 once pytz is updated.
        
        
        Changes in `pyaeso` 0.5 (2010-03-16)
        =====================================
        * Beginning long-term migration of code from ``pyaeso`` package to
        ``aeso`` package.
        
        * Added Current Supply/Demand (CSD) report to aeso.csd module.
        
        * Added Alberta Interconnected Electrical System (AIES) log report to
        aeso.aieslog module.
        
        * Several modules now have doctests.
        
        * Added ``print_aieslog.py`` and ``print_gen_output.py`` examples.
