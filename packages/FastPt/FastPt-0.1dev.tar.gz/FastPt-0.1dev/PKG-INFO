Description: Are you tired of the slow performance of Genshi? But
              you still long for the assurance that your output is well-formed that you
              miss from all those other templating engines? Do you wish you had Jinja's
              blocks with Genshi's syntax? Then look  no further, FastPt is for you!
              FastPt uses lxml to *quickly* compile Genshi-like syntax to *real python
              bytecode* that renders with blazing-fast speed! Don't delay! Pick up your
              copy of FastPt today!
