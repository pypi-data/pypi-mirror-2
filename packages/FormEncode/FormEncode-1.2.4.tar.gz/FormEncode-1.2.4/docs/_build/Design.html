<p>This is a document to describe why FormEncode looks the way it looks,
and how it fits into other applications.  It also talks some about the
false starts I&#8217;ve made.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-metaphor">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Basic Metaphor</a><a class="headerlink" href="#basic-metaphor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FormEncode performs look-before-you-leap validation.  The idea being
that you check all the data related to an operation, then apply it.
This is in contrast to a transactional system, where you just start
applying the data and if there&#8217;s a problem you raise an exception.
Someplace else you catch the exception and roll back the transaction.
Of course FormEncode works fine with such a system, but because
nothing is done until everything validates, you can use this without
transactions.</p>
<p>FormEncode generally works on primitive types.  These are things like
strings, lists, dictionaries, integers, etc.  This fits in with
look-before-you-leap; often your domain objects won&#8217;t exist until
after you apply the user&#8217;s request, so it&#8217;s necessary to work on an
early form of the data.  Also, FormEncode doesn&#8217;t know anything about
your domain objects or classes; it&#8217;s just easier to keep it this way.</p>
<p>Validation only operates on a single &#8220;value&#8221; at a time.  This is
Python, collections are easy, and collections are themselves a single
&#8220;value&#8221; made up of many pieces.  A &#8220;Schema validator&#8221; is a validator
made up of many subvalidators.  By using this single metaphor, without
separating the concept of &#8220;field&#8221; and &#8220;form&#8221;, it is possible to create
reusable validators that work on compound structures, to validate
&#8220;whole forms&#8221; instead of just single fields, and to support better
validation composition.</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;validation&#8221; and &#8220;conversion&#8221; are generally applied at the same
time.  In the documentation this is frequently just referred to as
&#8220;validation&#8221;, but anywhere validation can happen, conversion can also
happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="domain-objects">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Domain Objects</a><a class="headerlink" href="#domain-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are your objects, specific to your application.  I know nothing
about them, and cannot know.  FormEncode doesn&#8217;t do anything with
these objects, and doesn&#8217;t try to know anything about them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="validation-as-directional-not-intrinsic">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Validation as directional, not intrinsic</a><a class="headerlink" href="#validation-as-directional-not-intrinsic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One false start from earlier projects was an attempt to tie validators
into the objects they validate against.  E.g., you might have a
<a class="reference external" href="http://sqlobject.org">SQLObject</a> class like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Address</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SQLObject</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">fname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringCol</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">notNull</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">lname</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringCol</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">notNull</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">mi</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StringCol</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is tempting to take the restrictions of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Address</span></tt> class and
automatically come up with a validation schema.  This may yet be a
viable goal (and to a degree is attainable), but in practical terms
validation tends to be both more and less restrictive.  Also,
validation is contextual; what validation you apply is dependent on
the source of the data.</p>
<p>Often in an API we are more restrictive than we may be in a user
interface, demanding that everything be specified explicitly.  In a UI
we may assist the user by filling in values on their behalf.  The
specifics of this depend on the UI and the objects in question.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are often more restrictive in a UI.  For
instance, we may demand that the user enter something that appears to
be a valid phone number.  But for historical reasons, we may not make
that demand for objects that already exist, or we may put in a tight
restriction on the UI keeping in mind that it can more easily be
relaxed and refined than a restriction in the domain objects or
underlying database.  Also, we may trust the programmer to use the API
in a reasonable way, but we seldom trust user data in the same way.</p>
<p>In essence, there is an &#8220;inside&#8221; and an &#8220;outside&#8221; to the program.
FormEncode is a toolkit for bridging those two areas in a sensible and
secure way.  The specific way we bridge this depends on the nature of
the user interface.  An XML-RPC interface can make some assumptions
that a GUI cannot make.  An HTML interface can typically make even
fewer assumptions, including the basic integrity of the input data.  It
isn&#8217;t reasonable that the object should know about all means of
inputs, and the varying UI requirements of those inputs; user
interfaces are volatile, and more art than science, but domain objects
work better when they remain stable.  For this reason the validation
schemas are kept in separate objects.</p>
<p>It also didn&#8217;t work well to annotate domain objects with validation
schemas, though the option remains open.  This is experimentation that
belongs outside of the core of FormEncode, simply because it&#8217;s more
specific to your domain than it is to FormEncode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-sides-two-aspects">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Two sides, two aspects</a><a class="headerlink" href="#two-sides-two-aspects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FormEncode does both validation and conversion at the same time.
Validation necessarily happens with every conversion; for instance,
you may want to convert string representation of dates to internal
date objects; that conversion can fail if the string representation is
malformed.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, there&#8217;s only one operation: conversion.  An
exception raised means there was an error.  If you just want to
validate, that&#8217;s a conversion that doesn&#8217;t change anything.</p>
<p>Similarly, there&#8217;s two sides to the system, the foreign data and the
local data.  In Validator the local data is called &#8220;python&#8221; (meaning,
a natural Python data structure), so we convert <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">to_python</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from_python</span></tt>.  Unlike some systems, validators explicitly convert
in <em>both</em> directions.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the date conversion.  In one form, you may want
a date like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mm/dd/yyyy</span></tt>.  It&#8217;s easy enough to make the necessary
converter; but the date object that the converter produces doesn&#8217;t
know how it&#8217;s supposed to be formatted for that form.  Using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repr()</span></tt> or <em>any</em> method that binds an object to its form
representation is a bad idea.  The converter best knows how to undo
its work.  So a date converter that expects <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mm/dd/yyyy</span></tt> will also
know how to turn a datetime into that format.</p>
<p>(This becomes even more interesting with compound validators.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="presentation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Presentation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#presentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At one time FormEncode included form generation in addition to
validation.  The form generation worked okay; it was reasonably
attractive, and in many ways quite powerful.  I might revisit it.  But
generation is limited.  It works <em>great</em> at first, then you hit a wall
&#8211; you want to make a change, and you just <em>can&#8217;t</em>, it doesn&#8217;t fit
into the automatic generation.</p>
<p>There are also many ways to approach the generation; again it&#8217;s
something that is tied to the framework, the presentation layer, and
the domain objects, and FormEncode doesn&#8217;t know anything about those.</p>
<p>FormEncode does provide <a class="reference external" href="htmlfill.html">htmlfill</a>.  <em>You</em> produce
the form however you want.  Write it out by hand.  Use a templating
language.  Use a form generator.  Whatever.  Then htmlfill (which
specifically understands HTML) fills in the form and any error
messages.  There are several advantages to this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">htmlfill</span></tt>, form generation is easy.  You can just think
about how to map a form description or model class to simple HTML.
You don&#8217;t have to think about any of the low-level stuff about
filling attributes with defaults or past request values.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">htmlfill</span></tt> works with anything that produces HTML.  There&#8217;s zero
preference for any particular templating language, or even general
style of templating language.</li>
<li>If you do form generation, but it later turns out to be
insufficiently flexible, you can put the generated form into your
template and extend it there; you&#8217;ll lose automatic synchronization
with your models, but you won&#8217;t lose any functionality.</li>
<li>Hand-written forms are just as functional as generated forms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="declarative-and-imperative">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Declarative and Imperative</a><a class="headerlink" href="#declarative-and-imperative" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the objects &#8211; schemas, repeating elements, individual
validators &#8211; can be created imperatively, though more declarative
styles often look better (specifically using subclassing instead of
construction).  You are free to build the objects either way.</p>
<p>An example of programmatically building form generation:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">htmlfill_schemabuilder</span></tt> looks for special attributes in an HTML
form and builds a validation schema from that.</p>
