        *Note: This software is in a pre-alpha state.*
        
        The main documentation for this package is located at 
        `www.sempy.org <http://www.sempy.org>`_ , but this page offers a 
        minimal set of information to get started using Sempy.
        
        About
        ======
        
        Sempy is a numerical software package designed to solve partial differential 
        equations arising from the analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer.
        It is written in Python and carries the intuitive syntax of this language. 
        Furthermore, computational meshes can be imported from the Gmsh mesh generator, 
        making Sempy flexible towards handling complex geometries. 
           
        Getting started
        ----------------
        
        The quickest way to get started using the Sempy package is to install it 
        with  
        `easy_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall/>`_
        This can be achieved by e.g. typing::  
        
           $ easy_install sempy
        
        on the command line. This requires an internet connection to work. Another 
        possibility is to download the latest version as a 
        `zip <https://bitbucket.org/stianjnsn/sempy/get/tip.zip>`_ or
        `tar.gz <https://bitbucket.org/stianjnsn/sempy/get/tip.tar.gz>`_
        file and then install it with::
        
           $ python setup.py install
        
        It might be necessary to use super user privileges on the above 
        commands. For instance::
        
           $ sudo easy_install sempy
        
        Aslo, it might be necessary to run:: 
        
          $ sudo easy_install --upgrade sempy
          
        on a regular basis to obtain updated versions. 
        
        An example script
        ------------------
        
        Solve the Poisson problem with a simple script::
           
              import sempy
             
              X = sempy.Space( filename = 'square', n = 4, dim = 2 )
              A = sempy.operators.Laplacian( X ).matrix
            
              f = sempy.Function( X, basis_coeff = 1.0 )
              b = sempy.operators.Mass( X ).action_local( f.basis_coeff )
              u = sempy.Function( X, basis_coeff = 0.0 )
            
              [v, flag] = sempy.linsolvers.Krylov().solve( A, b, u.glob() )
              u.basis_coeff = X.mapping_q( v )
              u.plot()
