    I18N
        I18N is an abbreviation for internationalization.  It's often used to
        signify the need to translate words, number and date formats, and
        other pieces of data in a computer program so that it will work well
        for people who speak another language than yourself.

    UTF8
        A character encoding that maps all unicode codepoints to a sequence of
        bytes.  It is compatible with :term:`ASCII`.  It uses a variable
        number of bytes to encode all of unicode.  ASCII characters take one
        byte.  Characters from other parts of unicode take two to four bytes.
        It is widespread as an encoding on the internet and in Linux.
