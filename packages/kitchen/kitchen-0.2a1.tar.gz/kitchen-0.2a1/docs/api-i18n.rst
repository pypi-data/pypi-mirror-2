Kitchen.i18n Module
===================

.. automodule:: kitchen.i18n

Functions
=========

:func:`easy_gettext_setup` should satisfy the needs of most users.
:func:`get_translation_object` is designed to ease the way for anyone that
needs more control.

.. autofunction:: easy_gettext_setup

.. autofunction:: get_translation_object

Translation Objects
===================

The :class:`DummyTranslation` object is an implementation detail that most people don't
need to know about.  It is a fallback in case no real translation objects work
on your system.  Unlike the :class:`NullTranslation` object included in the
|stdlib|_, :class:`DummyTranslation` makes sure that any given function will
only return byte strings or unicode strings.  No function will return both.
