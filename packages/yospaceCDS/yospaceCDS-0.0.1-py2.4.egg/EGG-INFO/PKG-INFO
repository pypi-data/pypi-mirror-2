Description: A simple library providing access to the yospaceCDS video transcoding and mobile delivery services.
        
        yospaceCDS is underpinned by a powerful and extensible storage and transcoding system that is now available to integrate into your own video production workflow or internet/mobile video application.  The service allows you to upload video content of practically any format and order it to be transcoded into a wealth of different popular formats for web and mobile consumption. You can also order content to be forwarded to an FTP server for syndication purposes. With this library you integrate with yospaceCDS using a simple set of Web Services APIs to give you absolute control of your transcoding and storage requirements.
        
        SOAPpy is bundled with this download as it's not in pypi so I can't set a dependancy. Future releases may be based on one of the newer SOAP libraries in pypi.
