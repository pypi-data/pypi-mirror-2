Getting started
===============

This document is designed to get you up and running with ``django-pdf``...


Prerequisites
=============

These are the requirements to run ``django-pdf``:

 * Python **2.4+** (Python 3.x is **not** supported yet)
 * Django **1.2+**
 * boto
 * celery
 * ghettomq (This is optional, in case you don't want to use RabbitMQ)

These dependencies should be added to your ``requirements/project.txt`` file
and installed using pip_. For example::

    pip install -r requirements/project.txt

In addition to the software requirements outlined above, you will need an
`Amazon AWS`_ account that has EC2 services enabled to be able to run background
jobs on the cloud.
