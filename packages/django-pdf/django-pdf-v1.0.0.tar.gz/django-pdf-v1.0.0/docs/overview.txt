django-pdf
==========

`django-pdf` is an app that provides the ability to take user uploads of PDF
documents that are then subsequently stored on S3 and converted to single
png images for each page in the PDF.

Non Python Requirements
-----------------------

In order to accomplish this processing, Amazon AWS is used via the `boto`
library.  In addition, to provide a better user experience, celery/rabbitmq are
used to facilitate background transfer of PDF uploads to S3 instead of holding
the request/response cycle open during transfer.

`boto` and `celery` will be installed through normal pip processing of the
included requirements.txt file.  However, you will need to install rabbitmq
in order for uploads to get processed.

In addition, you will need an Amazon AWS account with access to EC2 enabled.
