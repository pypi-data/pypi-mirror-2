   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Sharpy
======

Sharpy is a client for the Cheddar Getter (https://cheddargetter.com/) API.
Cheddar Getter is a great service for handling recurring and usage based
billing.

There are some existing python Cheddar Getter clients but they have
significant licensing problems, packaging problems, bugs, and are only partial
implementations of the Cheddar Getter API.

Sharpy offers a number of advantages:

* Clear and simple BSD license.
* Both a high and low level API - Work with cheddar the way you want to.
* 100% test coverage.
* Proper packaging - Sharpy can be installed via easy_install and PIP.
* Implements the full Cheddar Getter API.
* Will have complete documentation soon.

That all being said, sharpy is still very new and is likely to undergo some 
significant API changes in the near future.  The code should be fairly safe 
to use as long as you understand that future releases may not be backwards 
compatible.
