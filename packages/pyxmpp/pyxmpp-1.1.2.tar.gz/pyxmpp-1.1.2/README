============================================
PyXMPP â€“ Python Jabber/XMPP implementation
============================================

Introduction
------------

PyXMPP is a Python XMPP (RFC 3920,3921) implementation, including some of the
well-known extensions. It is based on libxml2 -- fast and fully-featured XML
parser.

PyXMPP provides most core features of the XMPP protocol and several JSF-defined
extensions. PyXMPP provides building blocks for creating Jabber clients and
components. Developer uses them to setup XMPP streams, handle incoming events
and create outgoing stanzas (XMPP "packets").

Features
--------

- nearly complete XMPP Core (RFC 3920) protocol for client connections
  (includes SASL, TLS and Strinprep).
- mostly complete XMPP IM (RFC 3921) protocol (lacks privacy lists)
- XMPP error objects including translations to and from legacy codes for
  backward compatibility (`JEP-0086
  <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0086.html>`__).
- legacy authentication ("digest" and "plain") (`JEP-0078
  <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0078.html>`__). 
- component protocol (`JEP-0114 <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0114.html>`__). 
- Service Discovery (`JEP-0030 <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0091.html>`__).
- vCards -- both Jabber "vcard-temp" and RFC 2426
- basic parts of the Multi-User Chat protocol (`JEP-0045
  <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0045.html>`__)
- delayed delivery timestamps (`JEP-0091 <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0091.html>`__).
- Data Forms (`JEP-0004 <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0004.html>`__).
- In-Band Registration (`JEP-0077 <http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0077.html>`__).

Requirements
------------

For PyXMPP you will need:

  - `Python <http://www.python.org/>`__. Python 2.6 required.
  - `libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`__. Recent release (>=2.6.11) with python
    bindings is required. Additionally, all development files for libxml2 (usually in
    separate libxml2-devel package) are recommended for compilation of PyXMPP for best performance.
    PyXMPP 1.0 was tested with libxml2-2.7.6.
  - `dnspython <http://www.dnspython.org/>`__. 
    PyXMPP 1.0 was tested with version 1.6.0.

Installation
------------

To make sure you have all the requirements listed above or to prepare limited
(without the binary extension) build of PyXMPP you may want to run::

	python configure.py

You may manually pick the limited or full build of PyXMPP by editing the build.cfg file.

To build the package just invoke::

	python setup.py build

To install it::

	python setup.py install

If you had some older version of PyXMPP it is better to uninstall it (delete
pyxmpp subdirectory os your site-packages directory) before installing this one
or things may not work correctly.

You may also try::

	make

and::

	make install

instead.
