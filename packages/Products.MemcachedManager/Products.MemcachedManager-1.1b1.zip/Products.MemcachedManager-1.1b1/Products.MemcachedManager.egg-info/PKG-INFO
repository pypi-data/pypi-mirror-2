Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        MemcachedManager is a cache similar to RAMCacheManager, using memcached for 
        storage.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        `memcached`_
        
            This needs to be set up on a server Zope can connect to. You provide the
            IP address in the MemcachedManager settings screen.
        
        
        `pylibmc`_
        
            Install this in site packages (the regular "setup.py install" or easy_install)
            to enable python to talk to memcached. A note of caution: while pylibmc is faster
            it has seen less testing.
            
            If you need pylibmc 1.1.1 for Python 2.4, you can use
            http://dist.jarn.com/public/pylibmc-1.1.1jarn1.tar.gz
        
        or...
        
        `python-memcached`_
          
            Install this in site packages (the regular ``setup.py install``) to enable
            python to talk to memcached.
