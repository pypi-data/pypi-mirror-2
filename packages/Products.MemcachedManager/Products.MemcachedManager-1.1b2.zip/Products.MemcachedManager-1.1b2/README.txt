Introduction
============

MemcachedManager is a cache similar to RAMCacheManager, using memcached for 
storage.

Dependencies
============

`memcached`_

    This needs to be set up on a server Zope can connect to. You provide the
    IP address in the MemcachedManager settings screen.


`pylibmc`_

    Install this in site packages (the regular "setup.py install" or easy_install)
    to enable python to talk to memcached. A note of caution: while pylibmc is faster
    it has seen less testing.
    
    If you need pylibmc 1.1.1 for Python 2.4, you can use
    http://dist.jarn.com/public/pylibmc-1.1.1jarn1.tar.gz

or...

`python-memcached`_
  
    Install this in site packages (the regular ``setup.py install``) to enable
    python to talk to memcached.
