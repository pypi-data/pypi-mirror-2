        ========
        
        sadbipws (Serializing And Deserializing Binarily Is Possible With
        Sadbipws) is a binary data serializer, a bit like BSON (binary JSON),
        except that it has more features. The current format definition is
        defined in the Python code. The SADBIPWS format is not standardized.
        
        sadbipws is a Python 3.1+ module.

        When sadbipws has been installed, it can be used just like any other
        Python module. To see which parts of the module are useful, and to see
        how those parts function, run::
        
          pydoc3 sadbipws
        
        ``sadbipws`` can be imported with a simple ``import`` statement.
