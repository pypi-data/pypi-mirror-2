0.2.0b2 (2008-07-14)

  iterator.

0.2.0b1 (2008-06-05)
====================

- initialize hashdir lazy in filter to allow deferred hashdir
  creation.

0.2.0a3 (2008-04-23)

  unicode and convert only digests of files to strings. Fixes a bug

====================

- chmod to 440 on created hash files to let the group read and to make
  sure that files are not modified by owner.

====================

- added the hashDir zcml directive

- renamed environ variables to make it work with a server that sets
  the HTTP_ prefix

  delivering files

- tell and abort methods on WriteFile

- content type recognition/restrictions in wsgi filter see filter.txt

- allow relative paths in directory argument for wsgi filter

- updated config example in README.txt for paste deployment

- make filter and processor handle locking sockets correctly which are
  used by paste

0.1.1 (2007-11-22)
==================

- added testing.py for simpler use of extfile in tests

- Use product config z3c.extfile:storagedir to set the storage directory

- Registration of utility is now logged on INFO

- New ++static++ namespace and index.html view for IReadFile, see
  namespace.txt. This adds a dependency to z3c.filetype.

- delete datamanager on transaction boundaries. this is needed if
  running multiple tests with different hashdirs
