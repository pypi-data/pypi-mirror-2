 IResult adapter
=================

The IResult adapter is used by the publisher to get the right wrapper
around objects.

  >>> from z3c.extfile import adapter
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> from z3c.extfile.hashdir import ReadFile
  >>> rf = ReadFile(adapter.__file__)
  >>> request = TestRequest()
  >>> result = adapter.ReadFileResult(rf, request)
  >>> result
  <zope.publisher.http.DirectResult object at ...>
