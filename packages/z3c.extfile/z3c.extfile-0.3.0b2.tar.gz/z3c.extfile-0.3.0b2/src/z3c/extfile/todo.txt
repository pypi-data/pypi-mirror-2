Further Improvements
====================

zope.publisher.browser.BrowserRequest uses FieldStorage directly which
creates a tempflile for each multipart boundary upon upload. We have
to make the FieldStorage implementation pluggable by creating some
IFieldStorageFactory utilities.

If we are able to replace the FieldStorage implementation we can
provide an implemntation which stores the files as hashdir files, so
upon upload the file only has to be moved instead of iterated over in
python. This results in much faster handling of huge files upon
upload.
