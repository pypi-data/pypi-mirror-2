Installation Instructions
=========================

The easyiest way to install ZSyncer is to specify ``Products.ZSyncer`` as a
required egg in whatever buildout recipe you're using to manage your
Zope instance.

Be sure that you can make HTTP connections from the source server to
the destination server (and the Zope port). ZSyncer cannot work
without this. Command-line http clients such as lynx or wget may be
helpful for testing the connection.

It is highly advisable to be sure that the system clock on all your
servers are synchronized or at least very close.  On Unix, using
NTP may be a very good idea.

This version of ZSyncer is targetted only at Zope 2.12 and above.
It is not expected to work with prior versions.
