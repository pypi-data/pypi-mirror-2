.. note::

  :file:`ConnectionMgr.py` and :file:`test_ConnectionMgr.py` are
  confusingly marked with::

    Copyright (c) 2004, Corporation of Balclutha.

  In addition, :file:`ConnectionMgr.py` is also marked as follows::

    NOTE: This software is normally licensed under the GPL,
    but Alan Miligan graciously consented to allow its use in
    ZSyncer under the terms of the BSD license as described in
    the accompanying LICENSE.txt.  

  Unfortunately, :file:`test_ConnectionMgr.py` is still marked with a
  normal GPL license. It's unclear what the various copyright owners'
  intentions are here, so this note is included to make you aware
  before you choose to use this software!
