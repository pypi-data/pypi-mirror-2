ZSyncer is based on Gregor Heine's Client-Server product.
Not much code remains of that, but thanks for getting us going!

Thanks to Paul M. Winkler for much tinkering over the years!

Chris Withers is one again keeping things up to speed.
 
Contributors (alphabetical order):

  we swiped to do dynamic imports.

  and did a whole bunch of stuff.

  the "touch" feature.

  to add the Sync tab to new classes, and did some work on
