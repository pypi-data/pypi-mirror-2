This file is an installation script for this tool.
To use, either:

use the PortalQuickInstaller tool if you have it installed
(it comes with plone 2.0),

- or -

install by hand as follows:

Add an external method to the root of the CMF Site that you want the
tool registered in with the configuration:

 id: install_events
 title: Install ZSyncer Tool *optional*
 module name: ZSyncer.Install
 function name: install

Then go to the management screen for the newly added external method
and click the 'Try it' tab.  The install function will execute and give
information about the steps it took to register and install the
tool into your CMF Site instance.
You may then delete the external method.
