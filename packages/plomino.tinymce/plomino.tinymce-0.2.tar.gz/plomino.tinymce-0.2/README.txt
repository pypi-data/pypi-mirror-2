Plomino Fields and Actions Management

When a field is selected in the editor, a button in the interface of TinyMCE
allows to change some properties of this field.
By highlighting some text and clicking the same button, a field can be created
and its properties set (its name will be the selected text).

An action can also be created and modified using a similar mean.
