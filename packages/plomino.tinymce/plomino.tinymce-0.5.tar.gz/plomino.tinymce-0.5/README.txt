Introduction
============

Plomino TinyMCE Intrgration is a plugin for Plomino which allows to manage
easily Plomino objects (fields, actions and hidewhen) from TinyMCE interface.


Plomino Fields, Actions, Sub-forms and Hide-when Management
===========================================================

When a field is selected in the editor, a button in the interface of TinyMCE
allows to change some properties of this field.
By highlighting some text and clicking the same button, a field can be created
and its properties set (its name will be the selected text).

An action can also be created and modified using a similar mean.

You can only add an existing form in the editor (create a form before including
it).

A hide-when zone can be created directly from the editor. Select a part of the
form, click on the button, create the hide-when or select an existing one, and
apply. The selected zone will be surrounded with the correct start:hidewhen
and end:hidewhen tags.
