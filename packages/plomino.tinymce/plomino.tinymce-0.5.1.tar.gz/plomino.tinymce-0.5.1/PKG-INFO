        Plomino Fields, Actions, Sub-forms and Hide-when Management
        ===========================================================
        
        When a field is selected in the editor, a button in the interface of TinyMCE
        allows to change some properties of this field.
        By highlighting some text and clicking the same button, a field can be created
        and its properties set (its name will be the selected text).
        
        An action can also be created and modified using a similar mean.
        
        You can only add an existing form in the editor (create a form before including
        it).
        
        A hide-when zone can be created directly from the editor. Select a part of the
        form, click on the button, create the hide-when or select an existing one, and
        apply. The selected zone will be surrounded with the correct start:hidewhen
        and end:hidewhen tags.
