Description: 
        This Python package provides an environment for graphics applications that 
        closely resembles that of the Processing system.
        
        The project mission is to implement Processing's friendly graphics 
        functions and interaction model in Python. Not all of Processing is ported, 
        though, since Python itself already provides alternatives for many features 
        of Processing.
        
        The pyprocessing backend is built upon OpenGL and Pyglet, 
        which provide the actual graphics rendering. Since these are multiplatform, 
        so is pyprocessing.
