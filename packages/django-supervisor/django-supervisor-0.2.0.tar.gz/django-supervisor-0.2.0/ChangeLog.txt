v0.2.0:

  * More flexibility in selecting programs via command-line options.  You
    can now override both the "autostart" and "exclude" options:
      -l/--launch    =>  launch program automatically on startup
      -n/--nolaunch  =>  don't launch automatically, but keep in config
      -x/--exclude   =>  entirely remove program from the config
      -i/--include   =>  keep program from the config
  * Rename "autorestart" to "autoreload" since the former is an existing
    supervisord option that means something very different.  Also:
        * Allow selecting a subset of processes to auto-relod, via config file
          or command-line switch.
        * Add --noreload command-line switch to disable the autoreloader
  * Add a contrib supervisord.conf for django-ztask.
  * Add "getconfig" command, to print the final merged config to stdout.


v0.1.1:

  * In debug mode, provide an "autorestart" process that watches your code
    and restarts all processes when something changes.
  * project-specific config:  allow pre-specified [program] sections to be
    completely removed from the config, by specifying exclude=true.
  * project-specific config:  allow a [program:__overrides__] section to
    override options in all program sections at once.  Useful for things
    like globally switching autostart on/off or redirecting stderr.
  * app-specific config files:  use only one of management/supervisord.conf
    or contrib/<appname>/supervisord.conf, never both.  This prevent us
    from accidentally conflicting with settings specified by app authors.


v0.1.0:

  * Initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
