v0.1.1:

  * In debug mode, provide an "autorestart" process that watches your code
    and restarts all processes when something changes.
  * project-specific config:  allow pre-specified [program] sections to be
    completely removed from the config, by specifying exclude=true.
  * project-specific config:  allow a [program:__overrides__] section to
    override options in all program sections at once.  Useful for things
    like globally switching autostart on/off or redirecting stderr.
  * app-specific config files:  use only one of management/supervisord.conf
    or contrib/<appname>/supervisord.conf, never both.  This prevent us
    from accidentally conflicting with settings specified by app authors.

v0.1.0:

  * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
