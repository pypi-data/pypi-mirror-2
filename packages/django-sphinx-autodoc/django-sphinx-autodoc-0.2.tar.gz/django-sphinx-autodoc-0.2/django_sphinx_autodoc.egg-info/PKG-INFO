        Django-Sphinx-autodoc
        =====================
        
        
        Django is very nice in that way you can reuse a lot of applications in your
        projects. It means for big projects that you'll get a long list of applications
        in your settings.INSTALLED_APP.
        
        If you're using Django with Sphinx and want to autodoc all these apps in a wink
        of an eye, then this app is for you.
        
        A good combinaison for documenting your project would be:
         - **sphinx**
         - **django-sphinx-autodoc** to generate the doc from your applications
         - **django-sphinxdoc** to integrate the sphinx doc in your website
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        Copy the generate_autodoc.py file in your project directory, then execute it.
        
        It will scrape all your .py files in each application listed by INSTALLED_APP,
        then add automodules in your DS_ROOT/modules.rst.
        
        You will then see your applications grouped in 2 different categories:
        
        - **internal application** is an application located in your project directory
        - **external application** is an app which is somewhere in your pythonpath
          (preferably in your virtualenv)
        
        Good Practices
        --------------
        
        Add a docstring in your application's __init__.py file to describe it.
        django-sphinx-autodoc will automatically scrape it for you.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        You can modify some of the settings used by django-sphinx-autodoc:
        
        - **DS_ROOT**: root path for documentation (default to project_dir/doc)
        - **DS_MASTER_DOC**: name of your master document (default to "index.rst")
        - **DS_FILENAME**: name for the modules (default to "auto_modules.rst")
        - **DS_EXCLUDED_APPS**: list of applications to exclude (default to [])
        - **DS_EXCLUDED_MODULES**: list of files to exclude (default to ["__init__.py"])
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - Write tests
        - improve the not_relevant stuff to auto exclude a file without class or def
        - Django command extension to update the autodoc
