Description: Requests: The Simple (e.g. usable) HTTP Module
        ==============================================
        
        Most existing Python modules for dealing HTTP requests are insane. I have to look up *everything* that I want to do. Most of my worst Python experiences are a result of the various built-in HTTP libraries (yes, even worse than Logging). 
        
        But this one's different. This one's going to be awesome. And simple.
        
        Really simple. 
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Extremely simple GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE Requests
            + Simple HTTP Header Request Attachment
            + Simple Data/Params Request Attachment
            + Simple Multipart File Uploads
            + CookieJar Support
            
        - Simple Basic HTTP Authentication
            + Simple URL + HTTP Auth Registry
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        It couldn't be simpler. ::
        
            >>> import requests
            >>> r = requests.get('http://google.com')
        
        
        HTTPS? Basic Authentication? ::
            
            >>> r = requests.get('https://convore.com/api/account/verify.json')
            >>> r.status_code
            401
        
            
        Uh oh, we're not authorized! Let's add authentication. ::
            
            >>> conv_auth = requests.AuthObject('requeststest', 'requeststest')
            >>> r = requests.get('https://convore.com/api/account/verify.json', auth=conv_auth)
            
            >>> r.status_code
            200 
            
            >>> r.headers['content-type']
            'application/json'
            
            >>> r.content
            '{"username": "requeststest", "url": "/users/requeststest/", "id": "9408", "img": "censored-long-url"}'
        
        
        
        API
        ---
            
        **Requests:**
        
        All request functions return a Response object (see below).
        
        If a {filename: fileobject} dictionary is passed in (files=...), a multipart_encode upload will be performed.
        If CookieJar object is is passed in (cookies=...), the cookies will be sent with the request.
            
          GET Requests
            >>> request.get(url, params={}, headers={}, cookies=None, auth=None)
            <request object>
            
          HEAD Requests
            >>> request.head(url, params={}, headers={}, cookies=None, auth=None)
            <request object>
            
          PUT Requests
            >>> request.put(url, data='', headers={}, files={}, cookies=None, auth=None)
            <request object>
            
          POST Requests
            >>> request.post(url, data={}, headers={}, files={}, cookies=None, auth=None)
            <request object>
            
          DELETE Requests
            >>> request.delete(url, params={}, headers={}, cookies=None, auth=None)
            <request object>
            
        
        **Responses:**
            
            Request.status_code:
                 (Integer) Received HTTP Status Code Response
        
            Request.headers:
                (Dictionary) Received HTTP Response Headers
        
            Request.content:
                (Bytes) Received Content
        
            Request.url
                (String) URL of response. Useful for detecting redirects. 
        
        
        **HTTP Authentication Registry:**
        
            You can register AuthObjects to automatically enable HTTP Authentication on requests that contain a registered base URL string.
        
            >>> requests.add_autoauth(url, authobject)
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install requests, simply: ::
        
            $ pip install requests
            
        Or, if you absolutely must: ::
        
            $ easy_install requests
        
        But, you really shouldn't do that.
