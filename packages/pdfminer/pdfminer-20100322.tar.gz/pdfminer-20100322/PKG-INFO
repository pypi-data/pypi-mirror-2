Description: PDFMiner is a suite of programs that help
        extracting and analyzing text data of PDF documents.
        Unlike other PDF-related tools, it allows to obtain
        the exact location of texts in a page, as well as
        other extra information such as font information or ruled lines.
        It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files
        into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible
        PDF parser that can be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.
