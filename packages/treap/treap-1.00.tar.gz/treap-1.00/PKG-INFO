Description: 
        A set of python modules implementing treaps is provided.
        
        Treaps perform most operations in O(log2n) time, and are innately sorted.
        They're very nice for keeping a collection of values that needs to
        always be sorted, or for optimization problems in which you need to find
        the p best values out of q, when p is much smaller than q.
        
        Modules are provided for both treaps that enforce uniqueness, and treaps that allow duplicates.
        
        Pure python versions are included, as are Cython-enhanced versions for performance.
