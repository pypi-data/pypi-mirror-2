Description: Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-8 protocol (with an
        0-9-1 implementation on a separate git branch, for now) that tries to
        stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library. It
        also tries to stay neutral as to programming style, supporting (where
        possible) both synchronous and asynchronous approaches. Pika was
        developed primarily for use with RabbitMQ, but should also work with
        other AMQP 0-8 brokers.
