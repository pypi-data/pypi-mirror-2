Description: Tiger for Python
        ----------------
        
        This is a simple implementation of the Tiger cryptographic hash for Python. It
        uses the same API as all other hashing modules, with new(), update(), and
        digest()/hexdigest().
        
        It's written in C, and uses the standard Python/C bindings and the reference C
        implementation for Tiger. It has been tested on i386 and amd64, and correctly
        reports the reference hashes in standard order.
