Description: Introduction and Examples
        -------------------------
        
        The fuzzyparsers library provides a small collection of functions to sanitize free form user input.  For the 
        moment its chief value is the flexible date parser.
        
        The library has two main parsers.  The first is a prefix parser which compares a string to a list of strings 
        and returns the unique element of the list which matches the prefix.  An exception is thrown if the match is 
        not unique.
        
            >>> from fuzzyparsers import fuzzy_match
            >>> fuzzy_match(['aab','bba','abc'],'aa')
            'aab'
            >>> fuzzy_match(['aab','bba','abc'],'a')  # two strings starting with 'a'.
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ... 
            ValueError: ambigious match
        
        The second parser parses dates in various formats and returns a datetime.date object.  Accepted formats include::
        
            jan 12, 2003
            jan 5
            2004-3-5
            +34 -- 34 days in the future (relative to todays date)
            -4 -- 4 days in the past (relative to todays date)
        
        For instance:
        
            >>> from fuzzyparsers import parse_date
            >>> parse_date('jun 17 2010') # my youngest son's birthday
            datetime.date(2010, 6, 17)
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        * 0.7 - overhaul of date parsing api to support relative dates (not necessarily relative to the current date)
        * 0.6.x - initial public release and series of doc/install corrections
