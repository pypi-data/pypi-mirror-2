    Goals
    -----
    - Building context for rendering should be simple.

    - Source should be easy to follow and encourage this for implementing
      subclasses if possible.

    - Keep methods short and provide useful hooks for sub classing.

    - Embrace the instance and don't pass request nor context around.

    - Narrow the scope to most common use but without limiting less usual
      use-cases.
