== Cuisine
== Chef-like functionality for Fabric

[Fabric](http://fabfile.org) is an incredible tool to automate administration
of remote machines. As Fabric's function are rather low-level, you'll probably
quickly see a need for more high-level functions such as add/remove users and
groups, install/upgrade packages, etc.

Cuisine is a small set of functions that sit on top of Fabric, to abstract
common administration operations such as file/dir operations, user/group creation,
package install/upgrade, making it easier to write portable administration
and deployment scripts.

Cuisine's features are:

 * Small, easy to read, 1-file API
 * Covers file/dir operations, user/group operations, package operations
 * Text processing and template functions
 * All functions are lazy: they will actually only do things when the change
   is required.

Installation
============

To install Cuisine

>		python setup.py

Or simply put 'cuisine.py' in your PYTHONPATH, and create a 'fabfile.py' like this:

>    from cuisine import *
>    # Write your rules here

Cuisine automatically imports and wraps some of Fabric's API functions, so
you probably won't need anything else that this.

If you want more information, you can:

 * Look at Cuisine's [API](cuisine-api.html)
 * Read the [presentation on Cuisine](http://ur1.ca/45ku5)

Enjoy!
