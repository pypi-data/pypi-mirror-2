Description: 
        StarCluster is a utility for creating and managing computing clusters hosted on
        Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). StarCluster utilizes Amazon's EC2 web service
        to create and destroy clusters of Linux virtual machines on demand.
        
        To get started, the user creates a simple configuration file with their AWS account
        details and a few cluster preferences (e.g. number of machines, machine type, ssh
        keypairs, etc). After creating the configuration file and running StarCluster's
        "start" command, a cluster of Linux machines configured with the Sun Grid Engine
        queuing system, an NFS-shared /home directory, and OpenMPI with password-less ssh is
        created and ready to go out-of-the-box. Running StarCluster's "stop" command will
        shutdown the cluster and stop paying for service. This allows the user to only pay
        for what they use.
        
        StarCluster can also utilize Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes to provide
        persistent data storage for a cluster. EBS volumes allow you to store large amounts
        of data in the Amazon cloud and are also easy to back-up and replicate in the cloud.
        StarCluster will mount and NFS-share any volumes specified in the config. StarCluster's
        "createvolume" command provides the ability to automatically create, format, and
        partition new EBS volumes for use with StarCluster.
        
        StarCluster provides a Ubuntu-based Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in 32bit and 64bit
        architectures. The AMI contains an optimized NumPy/SciPy/Atlas/Blas/Lapack
        installation compiled for the larger Amazon EC2 instance types. The AMI also comes
        with Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and OpenMPI compiled with SGE support. The public AMI
        can easily be customized by launching a single instance of the public AMI,
        installing additional software on the instance, and then using StarCluster's
        "createimage" command to completely automate the process of creating a new AMI from
        an EC2 instance.
