Description: 
            StarCluster is a utility for creating and managing computing clusters
            hosted on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). StarCluster utilizes
            Amazon's EC2 web service to create and destroy clusters of Linux virtual
            machines on demand.
        
            To get started, the user creates a simple configuration file with their AWS
            account details and a few cluster preferences (e.g. number of machines,
            machine type, ssh keypairs, etc). After creating the configuration file and
            running StarCluster's "start" command, a cluster of Linux machines
            configured with the Sun Grid Engine queuing system, an NFS-shared /home
            directory, and OpenMPI with password-less ssh is created and ready to go
            out-of-the-box. Running StarCluster's "stop" command will shutdown the
            cluster and stop paying for service. This allows the user to only pay for
            what they use.
        
            StarCluster can also utilize Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes
            to provide persistent data storage for a cluster. EBS volumes allow you to
            store large amounts of data in the Amazon cloud and are also easy to
            back-up and replicate in the cloud.  StarCluster will mount and NFS-share
            any volumes specified in the config. StarCluster's "createvolume" command
            provides the ability to automatically create, format, and partition new EBS
            volumes for use with StarCluster.
        
            StarCluster provides a Ubuntu-based Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in 32bit and
            64bit architectures. The AMI contains an optimized NumPy, SciPy, Atlas,
            Blas, Lapack installation compiled for the larger Amazon EC2 instance
            types. The AMI also comes with Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and OpenMPI compiled
            with SGE support. The public AMI can easily be customized by launching a
            single instance of the public AMI, installing additional software on the
            instance, and then using StarCluster's "createimage" command to completely
            automate the process of creating a new AMI from an EC2 instance.
