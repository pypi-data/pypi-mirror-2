Description: django-mediagenerator_ is an asset manager for Django.
        With django-mediagenerator you can combine and compress your JS
        and CSS files. It also takes care of automatically versioning your
        files (including images), so browsers will load an updated version
        when you change any of your files. This works by adding a version
        hash to the file name. That way you can still use HTTP caches.
        
        An important advantage of the media generator is that it works
        in sandboxed hosting environments like App Engine.
        
        With its backend API the media generator allows you to flexibly
        add new features and adjust it to your needs. It also comes with
        several backends pre-installed. For example, you can use Sass_,
        Python (via pyjs_/Pyjamas), and PyvaScript_.
        
        Also, the media generator provides a development mode in which
        files don't get combined and compressed. This simplifies debugging
        because you can easily see which file contains a bug. Moreover,
        some backends add extra debug information in development mode
        to further simplify debugging.
