=======
 Cyrax
=======

Cyrax is a static site generator using Jinja2_ template engine.

It's inspired from Jekyll_ and Hyde_ site generators and started when I realized
that I'm dissatisfied with both of them by different reasons. When I tried to
come up with name I remembered my favourite character from Mortal Kombat 3 so
here we go.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cyrax depends on Jinja2 template library, you should either install it as your
distribution prefers (it's present in most of major distributions, particularly
in Debian and MacPorts), or use ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

   pip install jinja2

Then get cyrax by either cloning repository_ or installing by package manager::

   pip install cyrax

Usage
~~~~~

Read some docs_, run ``cyrax --help`` to read about command line options, look
at example_.
