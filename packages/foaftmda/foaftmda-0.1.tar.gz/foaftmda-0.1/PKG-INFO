Description: FOAF integration for TMDA
        =========================
        
        Put something like this in cron::
        
            0 0 * * * cat ~/.tmda/lists/whitelist ~/.tmda/lists/confirmed | mboxlist2foaf -m http://example.org/foaf#me -b http://example.org/whitelist > ~/public_html/whitelist.rdf
            0 0 * * * cat ~/.tmda/lists/whitelist ~/.tmda/lists/confirmed | mboxlist2foaf -m http://example.org/foaf#me -b http://example.org/whitelist -f n3 > ~/public_html/whitelist.n3
        
        And if you have an RDF file, perhaps built from various sources
        that you whant to check to authorize mail, you can do put the 
        following in your *~/.tmda/filters/incoming*::
        
            pipe-headers "checkfoaf -i /some/where/bigwhitelist.rdf" accept
