<h2>PyModel: Model-based testing in Python</h2>

<p>

<p>
<b>PyModel</b> is an open-source model-based testing framework in Python.

<p>
In unit testing, the programmer codes the test cases, and also codes
assertions that check whether each test case passed.  In model-based
testing, the programmer codes a "model" that generates as many test
cases as desired and also acts as the oracle that checks the cases.

<p>
Model-based testing is recommended where so many test cases are needed
that it is not feasible to code them all by hand.  This need arises
when testing behaviors that exhibit history-dependence and
nondeterminism, so that many variations (data values, interleavings,
etc.) should be tested for each scenario (or use case).  Examples
include communication protocols, web applications, control systems,
and user interfaces.  

<p>
PyModel supports on-the-fly testing, which can generate indefinitely
long nonrepeating tests as the test run executes.  PyModel can focus
test cases on scenarios of interest by composition, a versatile
technique that combines models by synchronizing shared actions and
interleaving unshared actions.  PyModel can guide test coverage
according to programmable strategies coded by the programmer.

<p>
PyModel provides three programs:

<ul>
 <li><a href="pma.html">pma.py</a> &nbsp; pymodel analyzer: generates a finite state machine (FSM) and computes properties by exploring a model program, FSM, test suite, or a product of these.
 <li><a href="pmg.html">pmg.py</a> &nbsp; pymodel graphics: generates a file of graphic commands from an FSM.
 <li><a href="pmt.html">pmt.py</a> &nbsp; pymodel tester: displays traces, generates tests offline, executes offline tests, or generates and executes tests on-the-fly.
</ul>

<p>
Use pma and pmg to visualize and preview the behavior of pmt.  Every
path through the graph created by pma (and drawn by pmg) is a trace
(test run) that may be generated by pmt, when pma and pmt are invoked
with the same arguments.

PyModel is also available at 
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyModel">PyPI</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel">GitHub</a>.

<p>
PyModel requires Python 2.6 (because it uses <code>itertools.product</code>).

<p>
PyModel is influenced by <a

translation or re-implementation.
