PyModel Samples

There are some examples in the subdirectories under the pymodel samples
directory: ABP, Marquee, PowerSwitch, Socket, Stack, WebApplication, etc.

Each sample subdirectory contains some test script modules: test.py,
test_scenarios.py, test_graphics.py etc.  Each of these test scripts
contains commented command lines that demonstrate combinations of
arguments and options.

To prepare to execute test scripts, put the pymodel directory on
your execution path.  Put the current directory (whatever it is) on
the PYTHONPATH by executing the tpath command ("source tpath" in bash,
just "tpath" in Windows).

To execute all the commands in a test script, run it with trun.py:

 trun.py test

 trun.py test_scenarios 

 (etc.)

Or, you can type individual commands that you find in the test
scripts, or try your own variations.

The test_graphics scripts run the analyzer and graphics programs, and
generate FSM modules and SVG files that can be displayed by a browser.
