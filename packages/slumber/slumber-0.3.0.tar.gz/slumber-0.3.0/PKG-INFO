Description: Slumber
        =======
        
        Slumber is a python library that provides a convenient yet powerful object
        orientated interface to ReSTful APIs. It acts as a wrapper around the
        excellent httplib2_ library and abstracts away the handling of urls, serialization,
        and processing requests.

        Getting Help
        ============
        
        There are two primary ways of getting help. We have a `mailing list`_ hosted at
        Google (http://groups.google.com/group/python-slumber/) and an IRC channel
        (`#slumber on irc.freenode.net`_) to get help, want to bounce idea or
        generally shoot the breeze.

        Requirements
        ============

        * Python 2.5+
        * httplib2
        * simplejson (If using Python 2.5, or you desire the speedups for JSON serialization)
        * pyyaml (If you are using the optional yaml serialization)

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        * Allowed nesting resources infinitely to allow more complex api usage.
        * Cleaned up the Meta class and allow subclassing ``slumber.API``
        * *(Backwards Incompatible)* Cleaned up the exception names.
        * *(Backwards Incompatible)* Renamed the ``slumber.API`` serialization kwarg from
          default_format to format to be more consistent
        * Improved the documentation
        * Added Some Tests (This could still be better)
        
        0.2.5
        -----
        
        * Fixed https urls and the accidental force to port 80
        * Fixed the assumption that all urls end in a trailing slash
        
        0.2.4
        -----
        
        * Fixed Including of Changelog.rst
        
        0.2.3
        -----
        
        * Updated the docs to include a section about url parameters
        
        0.2
        ----
        
        * *(Backwards Incompatible)* Move specifying a non default serializer from
          ``api.resource.get(format="yaml")`` to ``api.resource(format="yaml").get()``
          
        * Reworked the internal ``Resource`` api to not clobber any kwargs passed to it. This
          fixes a bug where you couldn't use ``format`` or ``url`` as the name for one of
          the url parameters.
        
        0.1.3
        -----
        
        * Fix for ``Resource.post()`` not passing kwargs to ``Resource.get()``
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * Initial public release of Slumber
