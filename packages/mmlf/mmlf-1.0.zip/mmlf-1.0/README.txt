Maja Machine Learning Framework

The Maja Machine Learning Framework (MMLF) is a general framework for 
problems in the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL). It provides a 
set of RL related algorithms and a set of benchmark domains. 
Furthermore it is easily extensible and allows to automate 
benchmarking of different agents. 

Among the RL algorithms are TD(lambda), DYNA-TD, CMA-ES,
Fitted R-Max, and Monte-Carlo learning. MMLF contains different 
variants of the maze-world and pole-balancing problem class as 
well as the mountain-car testbed.
