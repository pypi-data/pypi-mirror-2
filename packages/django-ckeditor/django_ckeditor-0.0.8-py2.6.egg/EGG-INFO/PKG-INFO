Description: Django CKEditor
        ================
        **Django admin CKEditor integration.**
        
        Provides a ``RichTextField`` and ``CKEditorWidget`` utilizing CKEditor with image upload and browsing support included.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        #. Install or add django-ckeditor to your python path.
        
        #. Add ``ckeditor`` to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.
        
        #. Copy the ``media/ckeditor`` directory into any directory within your media root. You can override the location in your settings (see below).
        
        #. Add a CKEDITOR_MEDIA_PREFIX setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies a URL prefix to the ckeditor JS and CSS media (not uploaded media). Make sure to use a trailing slash::
        
            CKEDITOR_MEDIA_PREFIX = "/media/ckeditor/"
        
        #. Add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies an absolute path to your ckeditor media upload directory. Make sure you have write permissions for the path, i.e.::
        
            CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = "/home/media/media.lawrence.com/uploads"
        
        #. Add ckeditor url include to the project's ``urls.py`` file::
            
            (r'^ckeditor/', include('ckeditor.urls')),    
        
        #. Optionally, set the CKEDITOR_RESTRICT_BY_USER setting to ``True`` in the project's ``settings.py`` file (default ``False``). This restricts access to uploaded images to the uploading user (e.g. each user only sees and uploads their own images). Superusers can still see all images. **NOTE**: This restriction is only enforced within the CKEditor media browser. 
        
        #. Optionally, add a CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This setting specifies a URL prefix to media uploaded through ckeditor, i.e.::
        
            CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX = "http://media.lawrence.com/media/ckuploads/
        
        (If CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PREFIX is not provided, the media URL will fall back to MEDIA_URL with the difference of MEDIA_ROOT and the uploaded resource's full path and filename appended.)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Field
        ~~~~~
        The quickest way to add rich text editing capabilities to your models is to use the included ``RichTextField`` model field type. A CKEditor widget is rendered as the form field but in all other regards the field behaves as the standard Django ``TextField``. For example::
        
            from django.db import models
            from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField
        
            class Post(models.Model):
                content = RichTextField()
        
        
        Widget
        ~~~~~~
        Alernatively you can use the included ``CKEditorWidget`` as the widget for a formfield. For example::
        
            from django import forms
            from django.contrib import admin
            from ckeditor.widgets import CKEditorWidget
        
            from post.models import Post
        
            class PostAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
                content = forms.CharField(widget=CKEditorWidget())
                class Meta:
                    model = Post
        
            class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
                form = PostAdminForm
            
            admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)
