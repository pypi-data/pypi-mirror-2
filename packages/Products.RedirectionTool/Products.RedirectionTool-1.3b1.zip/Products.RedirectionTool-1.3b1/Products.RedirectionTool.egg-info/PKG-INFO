        About
        -----
          The Redirection Tool allows the management of the aliases stored in
          "plone.app.redirector":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.redirector.
        
        
        Using The RedirectionTool
        -------------------------
          To make a redirection to a piece of
          content...
        
            1. Navigate to that content.
        
            2. Click the Aliases tab.
        
            3. Enter the short name or the absolute path that should redirect to the
               content.
        
            4. Click Add.
        
          There is also a Redirection and Aliases control panel under Site Setup which
          presents all the redirections in the site in one place, allows enabling and
          disabling alias management per content type, and lets you upload redirections
          in bulk.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.3b1 - 2010-07-03
        ------------------
        
        - Removed all ``*.mo`` files from the locales directory, as these don't need to
          be versioned.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Added the z3c.autoinclude entry point so this package is automatically loaded
          on Plone 3.3 and above.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Reorganised \*.txt-files into toplevel-folder or /docs-folder to match current
          best-practices.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Removed version.txt to avoid deprecation-warning on Zope-startup.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Changed IRedirectionTool into a Zope 3 interface.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added Dutch (nl) translation.
          [WouterVH]
        
        - Added basque (eu) translation.
          [erral]
        
        - Regenerated PO files.
          [erral]

          [erikrose]
        
        
        1.2.1 - 2009-02-11
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bugs that caused incorrect display of redirects on the
          @@manage-aliases and @@aliases-controlpanel pages.
          [hexsprite]
        
        - Expanded readme and packaged the release.
          [erikrose]
        
        
        1.2 - 2007-11-07
        ----------------
        
        - Updated for Plone 3 by using plone.app.redirector, replacing skin parts
          with a view + template, using GenericSetup for installation and migrate
          existing redirections on install.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Use new permission "RedirectionTool: Modify aliases" for the alias tab.
          [fschulze]
        
        - When adding an alias a security check is performed on the source path.
          This prevents users from linking to their own content from locations to
          which they normally don't have access.
          [fschulze]
        
        Prior 1.2
        ---------
        
        - Take into account site property allowAnonymousViewAbout in not_found_message
        
        - Added german translation.
          [spamsch]
        
        - Added default validators and actions.
          [spamsch]
        
        - Moved ActionProviderBase before SimpleItem so that actions tab is shown in ZMI
