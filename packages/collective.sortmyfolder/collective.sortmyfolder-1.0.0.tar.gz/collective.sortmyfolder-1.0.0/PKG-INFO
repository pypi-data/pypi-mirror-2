Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The piece of software that make possible sorting items in Plone contains hidden additional features.
        
        Normally, when you call a sort action in Plone, you call an URL like this::
        
            http://myhost/myfolder/folder_position?position=up&id=content_id
        
        ... of course, KSS/jQuery stuff in recent Plone versions will hide this feature, but is still available when you disable
        Javascript.
        
        The Plone UI has no way today for performing action like this::
        
            http://myhost/myfolder/folder_position?position=ordered&id=fieldname
        
        But the feature is inside Plone: in this way you will sort a folder automatically, using a field value for comparison
        (like "*title*", or "*created*").
        
        The *folder_position* script use internally the *orderObjects* API. This last method has some additional nice feature that
        unluckily *folder_position* not expone to users. But we can fix this.
        
        What this product do
        ====================
        
        This product add to Plone some of the features that follow, patching Plone a little (see also `#11317`__).
        
        __ http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11317
        
        Can now sort a folder in reverse order
        --------------------------------------
        
        You can call URL like this::
        
            http://myhost/myfolder/folder_position?position=ordered&id=created&reverse=1
        
        and this will sort the folder using reverse criteria.
        
        Add "delta" criteria to the sorting mechanism
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        You can call::
        
            http://myhost/myfolder/folder_position?position=up&id=content_id&delta=4
        
        and this will move the content down by 4 slot instead of default 1 (this feature, if you use Plone KSS/jQuery/Javascript
        sorting, is not so usefull).
        
        Add a nice Plone interface for global folder sorting
        ----------------------------------------------------
        
        Your "*Action*" menu will be populated with a new entry: "*Sort folder*". This will give to the user a Plone form where
        he can perform common sort operation.

        The last option make possible for users to specify a custom attribute, not in the list; if you don't like this
        just add a CSS rules that hide the ``choice_custom_field`` element. Use of this last option need some Javascript to
        be executed.
        
        What this product isn't
        =======================
        
        This product only reveal features that are already in Plone (inside the *orderObjects* method).
        It will not add new sorting behaviour.
