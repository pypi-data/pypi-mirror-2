Simple Google Reader access API (mainly feed management functions).

No official documentation was used, I partially reverse-engineered
it and partially used unofficial descriptions found on the web.

I use this module daily to subscribe, unsubscribe and rename feeds.

Source code is available on `BitBucket`_, use this page also to
report bugs and offer patches.
