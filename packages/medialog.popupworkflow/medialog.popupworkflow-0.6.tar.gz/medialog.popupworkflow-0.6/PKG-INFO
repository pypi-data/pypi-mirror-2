Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        This Plone product gives you a new'popup_workflow so you can "publish an item for pop-up effect when clicking on it in the navigation menu or wherever the state class  is shown (like in folder_listing, tableview, )
        The popup effect is disabled when logged in (so its possible to edit content "the normal way")
        
        
        How-to
        ==================
        - Install collective.prettyphoto
        - Install medialog.popupworkflow (in that order)
        - Change workflow of a folder or content type or everything to "Popup workflow"
        - Supported content types: folder (collective.gallery, Product.Maps, collective.truegallery), FormFolder, Page)
        - "Change state of some content to Popup Publish". For security reasons, the "change view menu is now disabled". You will need to "Normal Publish" it to change view.
        ÐÊLog out, or use another browser
        - Click on that item in the navigation portlet
        
        If you uninstall the product, you should uninstall or reinstall collective.prettyphoto

        0.3.0 (2010-08-16)
        ------------------
        - Added view for Maps (location and Map view). You will need to customize this to use it (go to portal skins, popupworkflow and press customize on it)
        - Changed script so it doesn mess up with TinyMCE javascript
        - Guard on "Popup Publish" not on gallery, plonetrueallery, maps, location
        
        Need help on getting the right view into the javascript (now, only one view  for folders can be used at a time.... the one you make an alias for in /portal_types/folder, like
        [place]Ê[@@galleryplaceview]
        [place]Ê[mapsplaceview]
