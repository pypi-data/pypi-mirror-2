Changelog
=========
To do:
Disable "view" when an item has been "Popup published" (I think this is a good idea)
Get the view into the javascript


0.3.0 (2010-08-16)
------------------
- Added view for Maps (location and Map view). You will need to customize this to use it (go to portal skins, popupworkflow and press customize on it)
- Changed script so it doesn mess up with TinyMCE javascript
- Guard on "Popup Publish" not on gallery, plonetrueallery, maps, location

Need help on getting the right view into the javascript (now, only one view  for folders can be used at a time.... the one you make an alias for in /portal_types/folder, like
[place]Ê[@@galleryplaceview]
[place]Ê[mapsplaceview]


0.1.0 (2010-08-14)
