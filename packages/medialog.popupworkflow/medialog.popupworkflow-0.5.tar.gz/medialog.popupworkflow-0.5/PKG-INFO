Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        This Plone product gives you a new'popup_workflow.
        Its basically the simple publication workflow with one weird extra: It lets you "publish an item for pop-up effect when clicking on it in the navigation menu
        
        What is this for
        ==================
        The idea is that a user (with the right permissions) can decide if he wants to show something as an overlay or as a normal page.
        
        1) Make a new workflow state and if the page/folder has this state it will open in an overlay instead of as a normal plone page
        
        
        How-to
        ==================
        - Install collective.prettyphoto
        - Install medialog.popupworkflow (in that order)
        - Change workflow of a folder or content type to "Medialog Popup workflow"
        - "Change state of some content to Popup Publish"
        - go to /portal_types in zmi and add alias for the view you want to use, for example
        [place] [@galleryplaceview] ..... I am working on fixing this step... help welcome
        - Click on that item in the navigation portlet
        
        
        The only view avalable for this at the moment is for collective.truegallery and collective.gallery and maps (works with both folder and location, but you will have to go to portal_skins/popuworkflow and customize it for now...)
        
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        I am doing some thinking (and asking) about how to make a generic view for popups. Hopefully this is doable.
        
        
        Need tests!

        To do:
        Disable "view" when an item has been "Popup published" (I think this is a good idea)
        Get the view into the javascript

        0.3.0 (2010-08-16)
        ------------------
        - Added view for Maps (location and Map view). You will need to customize this to use it (go to portal skins, popupworkflow and press customize on it)
        - Changed script so it doesn mess up with TinyMCE javascript
        - Guard on "Popup Publish" not on gallery, plonetrueallery, maps, location
        
        Need help on getting the right view into the javascript (now, only one view  for folders can be used at a time.... the one you make an alias for in /portal_types/folder, like
        [place]Ê[@@galleryplaceview]
        [place]Ê[mapsplaceview]
