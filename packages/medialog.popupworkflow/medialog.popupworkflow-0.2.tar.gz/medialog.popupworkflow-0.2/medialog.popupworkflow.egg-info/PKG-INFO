Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        This Plone product gives you a new'popup_workflows.
        Its basically the simple publication workflow with one weird extra: It lets you "publish an item for pop-up effect when clicking on it in the navigation menu
        
        What is this for
        ==================
        The idea is that a user (with the right permissions) can decide if he wants to show something as an overlay or as a normal page.
        The plan is that this product shall do two thing (currently its only doing one)
        1) Make a new workflow state and if the page/folder has this state it will open in an overlay instead of as a normal plone page
        2) Chane the view of the current object.
        
        TODO
        ====
        #2 above. The idea is to use a guard, so only "content types that has a template for pop-up view can be chosen.
        Currently I have made two such template (collective.trueallery, collective.gallery and Prodcut.Maps)
        
        Need tests!
