Plone 2.5 compatibility leftovers?
    - Do we still need to patch the ZPublisher? See method
      patch_publisher_exception_handling in patches.py
      
      After clearing out the last of the "not HAS_PLONE3" code,
      it looks like it only runs in browser.txt, but is needed
      there to keep the tests working.

DND for actions and thanks not enabled

For merge of manca's branch: these things still need checking/fixing

* Examine new outside source (jqueryui dnd)
    - can we find something lighter-weight for drag-and-drop;
      in any case, we should avoid a "custom" module.
    
* when the user d-n-d a field to the left we get this error: 
 "formElem.validator is not a function" toolbox.js(line 75)
