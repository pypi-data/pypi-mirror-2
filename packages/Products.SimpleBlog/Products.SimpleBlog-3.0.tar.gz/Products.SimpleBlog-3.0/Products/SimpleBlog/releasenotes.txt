3.0-b1
==============================
This release requires Plone 3.0x.

the migration so you can use the new portlet mechanism.
There is a migration button in SimpleBlog's configlet.
You also may have to reindex the catalog.
There is a new permission for the visiblity of the new 
portlet. Go to ZMI and then the security tab for your
plone instance and check the SimpleBlog permissions 
for this. 
Also, check the configlet because a few things
have changed.

==============================
1.2beta1:
==============================
Important:
In order to make this version work you need at least Plone 2.0.1. If you want to 
make it work in Plone 2.0 you will have to get PloneBatch.py from version 2.0.1.
You can get it from CVS or you can contact me (danny.bloemenaal@companion.nl).

There are now two different permissions: one to add a blog and one to add a blog entry:
SimpleBlog: Add Blogentry
Simpleblog: Add Blog
Don't forget to look at the permissions in your portal and your workflows!

Renamed the id labels for the content types to Short name to make it more plone compliant.

Default view for a Blog is now set to description only (was full).

Added a feature that allows an entry to be listed 'always on top'. Handy for announcements  etc.

Added start/end attributes to entries so that they can be displayed in the portal calendar portlet
(see portal_calendar tool in zmi to add blog entries to the calendar). Note: you will have to reindex the
catalog (see ZMI portal_catalog/advanced) or else your entries won't show up in the calendar.

Fixed a bug in the installer.

Added a calendar in the various portlets which is quite common for blogs. This calendar shows
published entries in the context of the blog or, when the portlets are used outside blogs, in the context
of the current folder and subfolders. Note: you will have to reindex the
catalog (see ZMI portal_catalog/advanced) or else your entries won't show up in the calendar.

Added an option in the SimpleBlog configlet (plone setup) to control if there are
icons shown before the entry titles in the various entry overviews.

Added a message in the blog view and blog folder view when there are entries but none of them
has been published yet to tell the user (with edit permission) that he can find his entries in the 
folder_contents view.

Refixed the problem of 1.1a. Hopefully it works now.

Added batch navigation to the various templates for when there are many entries. 
Important: you need Plone 2.0.1 or higher for this to work. Check out PloneBatch.py from
cvs or contact me (danny.bloemendaal@companion.nl) if you want to make it work with Plone 2.0.

Added the document icons to the various views (print, send-to etc).

Extended css usage so that SimpleBlog is now very flexible with respect to presentation modification. 
See SimpleBlogCSS.css.dtml.

Modified some of the templates to make it work in Plone 2.0 with respect to the borders (top_slot).

You may have to do a schema update in the archetype_tool in ZMI. Select all the SimpleBlog
content types and choose All objects and click on Update schema.

==============================
1.1a:
==============================
Fixed a problem where someone uses VHM to redirect to the plone site. SimpleBlog wouldn't show
any BlogEntries at all in this case.

==============================
1.1:
==============================
Fixed some bugs with the configlet so it works better with 2.0
Removed some uninstall code that apparently didn't work well. Feel free to do it better!
Adjusted the views a little so they are more Plone 2.0 compliant.
Allowed the description of the Blog to be structured.
Fixed a problem with the content-type. Now the body of the Entry defaults to text/html
For a Blog Entry, changed the VisualWidget for RichWidget to allow upload of content. (you
might have to update the schema in the archetype_tool).

==============================
1.01:
==============================
Fixed a bug that didn't register the control panel in 2.0
Fixed a bug causing Entries not to show up on the frontpage when your plone site is inside a folder
Added a template that can be used as a stand-alone blog page that collects entries in subdirectories and can be used as your site's homepage.

==============================
1.0 Final:
==============================
Fixed some bugs and removed the Link field. 
An additional link field is confusing and inline linking is much more flexible and powerful. Therefore it is removed.

Don't forget to update the Schema in archetype_tool in ZMI if your are running earlier releases.
