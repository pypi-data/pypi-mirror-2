Installing SimpleBlog


Requirements:
    * Plone 3.x or higher (this version will NOT work with previous versions)
       and all it's dependencies.

Install:
    * Copy the entire SimpleBlog folder to your zope Products folder and restart Zope
    * Use QuickInstaller to install SimleBlog into your Plone site.

During the installation, SimpleBlog creates a workflow that is attached to the BlogEntry portal type.
This workflow is very simple and has two states: 'draft' and 'published'. Of course you can create your
own workflow but this one is made for your convenience. Of course you can also use the standard plone workflow.

Also, a simpleblog_tool is installed in the portal which gives you a few parameters that you can 
adjust for SimpleBlog. In your Plone site there is a control panel for SimpleBlog. See readme.txt for more info.

When the installation is finished, you should check the permissions in ZMI for your portal. There will be five
new permissions:  SimpleBlog: Add Blog, SimpleBlog: Add BlogEntry, SimpleBlog: Add BlogFolder and SimpleBlog: Cross-post
and SimpleBlog: View portlet.
You most certainly will have to assign roles, otherwise no one will be able to add Blogs other than the Manager.

That's about all. Don't forget to read the readme!
