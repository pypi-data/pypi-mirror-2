Description: What is SimpleBlog?
        ===================
        
        SimpleBlog is an easy to use Plone based weblog application. It has no
        fancy blogger-api/backlink stuff etc. It does support
        categories. Writing entries is done from inside Plone.
        
        SimpleBlog comes with three new portal types: Blog, BlogFolder and
        BlogEntry:
        
        - Blog: Folderish object that is the container for the BlogEntries and
          the front-page of the weblog.
        
        - BlogEntry: Entry object inside the weblog.
        
        - BlogFolder: Folder that can only exist inside the Blog
          container. The folder allows you to organize the BlogEntries in any
          way you like.
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        After you have set the permissions correctly in ZMI (see install.txt)
        you can go to any folder that you have permissions for and add a Blog
        from any of the dropdown lists. You will be given a form where you can
        provide the necessary information to create a new Blog:
        
        * **Short Name**, **Title**, **Description** will speak for
            themselves.
        
        * **BlogEntries to display** defines how many items should be visible
            on the Blog's front-page.
        
        * **Possible Categories** is a list of categories that can be used
            inside BlogEntries (one category per line). More about categories
            later.
        
        After you have created the Blog, you can adjust its Display settings
        from the Display menu in Plone. Currently there are 3 different
        display settings. Besides these settings, there is also a stylesheet
        in product's skin that you can customize at will.
        
        After you have created the Blog, you can start creating BlogEntries.
        Choose BlogEntry from the Add items list and fill in the form:
        
        * **Short Name**, **Title**, **Description**, **Body** will speak for
          themselves. **Note** when you use the Upload a file field, be aware
          that it will replace the current content!!
        
        * **Cross-post in** here you can pick another blog in the portal where
          this entry will also be shown.
        
        * **Always on top** Controls if the Entry, when published is always
          shown first. This can be handy for announcements etc.
        
        * **Categories** Select one or more categories from the list to
          classify the BlogEntry.
        
        * **Related items** point to other content in your portal to indicate
          them as related.
        
        * **Allow Discussion on this item** control whether people can comment
          on this entry.
        
        After the BlogEntry is saved, it will be in the 'draft' workflow state
        and is only visible by the owner and the manager (by default).  So, in
        order to make it appear on the Blog's front-page, it must be set in
        the 'published' state. The Blog will search and display the
        BlogEntries that have this state (this state is defined in the
        simpleblog_tool in ZMI and in the configlet in Plone setup). When
        putting the BlogEntry in the published state, you can also choose to
        give it an effective date somewhere in the future. SimpleBlog uses the
        standard way of publishing content.
        
        Inside the Blog you can create BlogFolders. These are a bit similar to
        the Blog itself in that it has roughly the same view but this time it
        only shows the Entries that are stored inside the BlogFolder (and
        subfolders). BlogFolders are there for your convenience, to organize
        or archive Entries in any way you want and to have additional
        categories (see below).
        
        Categories
        ==========
        
        SimpleBlog can use categories to classify BlogEntries. When you edit
        and configure the Blog object, you can provide it with a list of
        categories that will present itself as a multi-selection list when you
        edit/create a BlogEntry.  Next to that, BlogFolders can define
        additional categories.  In BlogEntries created inside the BlogFolder,
        a selection can be made out of the categories defined in the Blog
        *and*, additionally, out of the ones defined by the BlogFolder(s) it
        sits in. All the categories will add up. This feature can be useful
        when the Blog is maintained by several authors. You can then
        incorporate some policy that certain Entries must be created in
        specific BlogFolders because of the additional categories. Categories
        you can later search for but you don't want exposed to all the other
        authors.
        
        Next to categories defined by the Blog object and the BlogFolders, you
        can also define a set of global categories. These categories are
        available to all the BlogEntries created in the portal.  Defining
        these global categories can be done in ZMI in the simpleblog_tool or
        in the Plone setup.
        
        BlogEntries can be searched for in the Catalog and in Topics using
        categories. Use the EntryCategory index.
        
        The blog portlet
        ================
        
        SimpleBlog comes with a fully configurable portlet than can show 4
        different parts: recent entries, categories, a calendar widget and
        recent comments. You can use plone's portlet manager to configure each
        portlet. SimpleBlog's configlet in the Site Setup allows you to
        control how and if portlets are created in new Blogs that are added to
        the portal. Also note that the portlet can be used outside the context
        of a Blog. In that case it will aggregated entries from all Blogs
        inside the folder hierarchy from where the porlet is shown.
        
        Configuring SimpleBlog
        ======================
        
        SimpleBlog allows you to control a few things in its behavior. Go to
        Site Setup in your plone instance.
        
        Using SimpleBlog as your homepage in Plone
        ==========================================
        
        Inside the skin folder there is a template called
        **simpleblog_standalone**. First get rid of the current index_html in
        your portal root by deleting it or renaming it. Then create a new Page
        template in the root and call it index_html.  Then copy/paste the code
        from simpleblog_standalone in there and adjust it at will. All this is
        done in ZMI.
        
        Well, that's all you have to know to set up SimpleBlog. Enjoy it.

              from plone's own setting for this because with blogposts you usually do want
