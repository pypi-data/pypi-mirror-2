0.8.0 (2011-05-16)
==================

 * Port from opencore's override of the csv exporter: optionally include
   allowed senders in export; and always include a final item in each row
   of the CSV, describing the user's subscription-status.

 * Add export_messages_to_tempfile method on export utility
   which writes the messages' mbox to a tempfile and returns
   the (tmpfd, tmpfilename) -- this is better than writing
   to memory for lists with large archives.  (Code written
   by slinkp in opencore -- i'm moving it to listen)

 * Make "confirm-member" behavior consistent with "subscribe" behavior:
   on a non-member-moderated list, both actions should allow the 
   confirmation email to come from a different address than the original 
   message, provided the subject is left intact (including both the pin 
   and the original sender)

 * Handle non-ASCII characters in message subject

 * Fix moderation queue when non-ASCII emails are queued
