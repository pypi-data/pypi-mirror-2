Description: =========
        syscon-nc
        =========
        
        syscon-nc is just the same as <`syscon <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/syscon>`_ in the same version, only without the cryptographic functions.
        
        You should only use syscon-nc, if you are not allowed to use strong cryptography (AES) or if you want to analyse the data sent by syscon. Otherwise, it is much safer to use normal syscon
