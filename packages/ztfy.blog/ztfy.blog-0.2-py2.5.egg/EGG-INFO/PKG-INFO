        What is ztfy.blog ?
        ===================
        
        ztfy.blog is a set of modules which allows easy management of a simple web site based on Zope3
        application server.
        
        It's main goal is to be simple to use and administer.
        
        So it's far from being a "features full" environment, but available features currently include:
         - a simple management interface
         - sites, organized with sections and internal blogs
         - topics, made of custom elements (text or HTML paragraphs, resources and links)
         - a default front-office skin.
        
        All these elements can be extended by registering a simple set of interfaces and adapters, to create a
        complete web site matching your own needs.
        
        A few list of extensions is already available in several packages, like:
         - ztfy.blog.video, which allows basic customized handling of videos resources
         - ztfy.gallery, which provides basic management of images galleries.
