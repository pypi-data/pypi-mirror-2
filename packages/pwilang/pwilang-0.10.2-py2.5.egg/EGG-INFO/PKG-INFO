Description: pwilang is a text processor. The syntax of its file are indent-based, much like Python or Yaml. Its output is primarily meant to be XML (html being a subset of it as well as the main focus of this application).
        
        The goal of this parser is to actually give a way of writing Html content without having to close the tags manually, force a certain visual layout on the file (an indent-based language forces you to indent !), and also offers a way of having macros/automations.
