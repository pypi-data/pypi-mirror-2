Installation
=============

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, just do this:

* Add ``Products.ColorField`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    |    [buildout]
    |    ...
    |    eggs =
    |        ...
    |        Products.ColorField

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    |    [instance]
    |    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    |    ...
    |    zcml =
    |        Products.ColorField

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    |    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.


Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.

For that, move (or symlink) the ``ColorField`` folder of this project
(``Products.ColorField/Products/ColorField``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

You can also skip the ZCML slug if you install this package the **Zope 2
Product** way.

Set OUTPUT_FORMAT in config.py of the field itself to have the color codes in HTMLColor, RGB,
HexColor or PILColor. Default is HTMLColor.

Usage
============

1. In your custom Archetype, add:

    |    from Products.ColorField import ColorWidget, ColorField

2. Use it like a regular field/widget in your Type's Schema.

    |    ColorField('my_color',
    |        default='#00FFFF',
    |        output_format='HexColor',
    |        widget=ColorWidget(
    |            label='My color',
    |            allow_brightness=True)
    |    ),
