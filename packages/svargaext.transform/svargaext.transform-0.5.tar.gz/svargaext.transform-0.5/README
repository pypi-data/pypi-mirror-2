svargaext.transform
===================

Application for transforming source code from one format to another (for
example, CleverCSS in CSS, CoffeeScript in JavaScript).

It requires a bit of configuration dropped in `settings.py`::

    TRANSFORM = {
        'clevercss': {'main': {'clevercss/*.ccss': 'css/*.css'},
                      'someapp': {'static/test.ccss': 'css/test.css'}},
        'coffee': {'main': {'*.coffee': '*.js'}},
        }

Configuration description:

 - ``TRANSFORM`` is a variable, containing mapping of backend to rules.
 - Rules are mapping between name in ``STATIC_URLS`` to a dictionary of
   ``source``: ``target`` mapping.

Source can contain ``*`` to wildcard match files. In this case target should
contain ``*`` as well.

Installation
------------

It's that easy::

  pip install svargaext.transform
