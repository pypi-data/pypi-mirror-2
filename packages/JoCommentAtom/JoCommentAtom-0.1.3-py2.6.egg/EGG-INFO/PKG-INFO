        ======================
        
        .. note::
        
            It is highly recommended to use `virtualenv
            <http://virtualenv.openplans.org>`_ in order create isolated Python
            evironment and not to install packages in the system-wide
            Python installation. You may also take a look at `virtualenvwrapper
            <http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/>`_.
        
        #. Create a user in the Joomla's database and grant him an access to
           the following tables:
        
           - jos_comment (obviously, this is where all comments are stored)
           - jos_content (mandatory for proper URL generation for atom entries links)
