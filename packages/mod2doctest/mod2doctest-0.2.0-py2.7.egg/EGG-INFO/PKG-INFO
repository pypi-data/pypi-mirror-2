Description: mod2doctest
        ===========
        
        mod2doctest is a module that converts a python module to a doctest 
        compatible docstring.  
        
        It's kind of like taking a python script, pasting it into an interactive
        interpreter and then copying the output back into a docstring.  
        
        With mod2doctest you can set up a test the "quick and dirty" way -- just by
        making a module that tests your code, running it, and then inspecting the 
        output.  Then, you can use mod2doctest to take a snapshot of the output and 
        convert it to a permanent test fixture.
        
        Also has many convenience to make this process easier like: 
          
          * Providing `#>` and `#|` comments: `#>` prints to both your docstring
            and stdout and `#|` print just to your docstring (which will show
            up as text in a sphinx generated webpage)
          
          * adding ellipse markers for memory id / trace back 
          
          * Cleaning up your docstring for sphinx inclusion
