What is it?
===========

It's a small package to manage hexagonal grids.  You tell it the size of
the grid, and the size of the canvas you have, and it tells you the
coordinates for drawing it.  For examples, see the ``demos`` directory.

Installation
============

To build it::

    python setup.py build

To install it::

    python setup.py install

Type::

    python setup.py --help

for other things you can do.

Note: if you're on a Linux box you can just type ``make`` and ``make
install`` in the usual manner.
