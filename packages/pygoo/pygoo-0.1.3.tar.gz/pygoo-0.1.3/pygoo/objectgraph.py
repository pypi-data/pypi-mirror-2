    """An ObjectGraph is an undirected graph of ObjectNodes.
    An ObjectNode "looks like" an object, with a class type and any number of properties/attributes,
    which can be either literal values or other objects in the graph. These properties are accessed
    using dotted attribute notation.

    The ObjectGraph edges (links) are a bit special in that they are undirected but have a different
    name depending on the direction in which they are followed, e.g.: if you have two nodes, one
    which represent a series, and another one which represent an episode, the link will be named
    "series" when going from the episode to the series, but will be named "episodes" when going from
    the series to the episode.

    When setting a link in the graph, you should define a name for the reverse name of the link, but if
    you don't a default name of "is(%Property)Of" will be given to it.
    For instance, if we have movie.director == personX, we should also have
    personX.isDirectorOf == movie (actually "movie in personX.isDirectorOf").

    The ObjectGraph class provides ways of querying objects in it using type information,
    properties matching filters, or just plain lambda functions that returns whether a node
    is acceptable or not.

    An ObjectGraph can be thought of as a context in which objects live.

    Even though the dotted attribute access makes this less visible, the links between ObjectNodes
    are first-class citizens also, and can themselves have attributes, such as confidence, etc...
