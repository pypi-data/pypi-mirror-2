Description: Snaked
        ======
        
        Very light and minimalist editor inspired by Scribes. Snaked intended mostly for
        python developers but other Scribes users may find it useful too.
        
        Shortly, Snaked is Scribes with blackjack & hookers.

        Features
        --------
        
        * Light UI. There are no menu, tool bar, status bar or project browser at all.
          Only editor view  itself.
        
        * `gtksourceview2 <http://projects.gnome.org/gtksourceview/>`_ based.
        
        * Keyboard oriented control.
        
        * Auto projects. In most cases you do not need such boring operation like
          ``File`` â†’ ``New project``. Just start edit your file.
        
        * Project navigation via Quick Open dialog.
        
        * Sessions to store last opened editors.
        
        * Restoring last edit position.
        
        * Python auto complete and navigation via rope with very flexible type hinting
          framework. PyGtk, Django support.
        
        * Basic python code lint via pyflakes.
        
        * Snippets.
        
        * Unittests (with `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`_ as backend, so there is
          support for usual UnitTest   cases, nose cases and ``py.test`` itself).
        
        * Spell check.
