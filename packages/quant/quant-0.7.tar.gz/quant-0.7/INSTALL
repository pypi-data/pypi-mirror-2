#  The Quant Install Guide

Welcome to the Quant Install Guide.

This guide describes using the Quant installer to create new Quant services.

The Quant installer will deploy Quant into a new virtual Python environment.

New services are set up with an SQLite database. Installer options exist
for using other database management systems, and it is possible to migrate
between different database management system after the service is created.

## Installation Steps

1.  Prepare by checking these packages are installed (Debian package names):

        apache2-mpm-worker
        build-essential
        libapache2-mod-wsgi
        python
        python-dev
        sqlite3
        libsqlite3-dev
        python-scipy


2.  Download the Quant installer (and make it executable):

        $ curl -O http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/docs/quant-virtualenv
        $ chmod +x quant-virtualenv


3.  Run the Quant installer. Note that the PATH folder should never be
    under DocumentRoot of the Apache installation or any other directory
    exposed via Apache web server:

        $ ./quant-virtualenv PATH

    The installer will download and install the Quant system, and then create
    a service instance with a new Quant config file, HTML templates, static
    media, an SQLite database, and an Apache configuration file.

    Read the output of the installer for information about your new service.


4.  Include the generated Apache configuration file (filesystem path is
    displayed by the installer) in your main apache config, for example
    within a new VirtualHost for the new Quant site.

    Use the Apache Include directive:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName YOUR-QUANT-SITE
            Include PATH/var/httpd-autogenerated.conf
            WSGIDaemonProcess quant threads=25 maximum-requests=1000
        </VirtualHost>


5.  Change file ownership to the Apache user (or to the user which the WSGI
    daemon process runs as):

        $ chown -R {www-user}:{www-user} PATH


6.  Restart Apache, and load Quant in your browser (login: 'admin', 'pass').
