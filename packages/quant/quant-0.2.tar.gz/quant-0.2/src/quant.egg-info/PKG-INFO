Description: 
        
        The Quant system is a Python enterprise application for quantitative analysis.
        
        Quant contains a domain model for quantitative analysis which can used and extended to support different contexts.
        
        
        Install Guide
        -------------
        
        The easiest way to deploy the Quant system is with the quant installer (called quant-virtualenv)::
        
            $ wget http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/docs/quant-virtualenv
            $ chmod +x quant-virtualenv
        
        The installer will build a virtual Python environment with Quant installed, and will
        set up a new site with an sqlite database, and an Apache config file to be included in
        the main Apache configuration (see below).
        
        Before running the installer, make sure the following packages are installed::
        
            $ sudo aptitude install build-essential gcc python-numpy python-scipy
        
        Also, make sure Apache mod_python is enabled (sorry, this is being fixed)::
        
            $ sudo a2enmod python
        
        If you're instested, find out about the installer options by running::
        
            $ ./quant-virtualenv --help
        
        Run the installer, at least with a path argument::
        
            $ ./quant-virtualenv ./my-quant-site
         
        Then change ownership of the entire site to the Apache server::
        
            $ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data ./my-quant-site
        
        You can do more complicated things with the installer (see --help) and
        with the file permissions and ownerships, but those few lines should work.
        
        Finally, follow the instructions about configuring Apache that are shown
        by the installer. Pick a fully qualified domain name, create a new virtual
        host for it, that includes the auto-generated Quant configuration mentioned
        by the installer. Then configure your DNS.
        
        A new Apache virtual host could simply look like this:
        
            <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerName YOUR-QUANT-SITE-DOMAIN-NAME
                Include /path/to/my-quant-site/var/httpd-autogenerated.conf
            </VirtualHost>
        
        After restarting, your virtual host should show a page saying 'Welcome to Quant'.

        At the moment, Quant is currently being developed and tested on Ubuntu 10.10 (64 bit) with Python 2.6 only, although it should work on any recent Linux distribution.
