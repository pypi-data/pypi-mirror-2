Description: 
        
        Welcome to Quant
        ----------------
        
        Quant is a Python enterprise application for quantitative analysis. 
        Quant combines `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ and `DomainModel
        <http://appropriatesoftware.net/domainmodel/Home.html>`_.
        
        Quant contains a domain model of quantitative analysis. It has object markets,
        prices, contracts, books and reports. There are cohesive mechanisms for pricing
        and reporting. The domain model can easily be extended to support different
        applications of quantitative analysis.
        
        Please note: this is new software; several important things don't work at all.
        
        
        Install Guide
        -------------
        
        The easiest way to deploy the Quant system is with the quant installer::
        
            $ wget http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/docs/quant-virtualenv
            $ chmod +x quant-virtualenv
        
        The installer will build a virtual Python environment, and install
        the Quant software. The installer will then set up a new site with an SQLite
        database, and it will create an Apache config file to be included in the main
        Apache configuration (see below).
        
        Before running the installer, make sure the following packages are installed::
        
            $ sudo aptitude install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi build-essential gcc python-numpy python-scipy
        
        Also, make sure Apache mod_wsgi is enabled::
        
            $ sudo a2enmod wsgi
        
        Run the installer, at least with a path argument (see --help for options)::
        
            $ ./quant-virtualenv YOUR-SITE-DIR
         
        The path argument can be relative or absolute.
        
        Then, change ownership of the entire site to the Apache server::
        
            $ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data YOUR-SITE-PATH
        
        You can do more complicated things with the installer (see --help) and
        with the file permissions and ownerships, but those few lines should work.
        
        Finally, follow the instructions about configuring Apache that are shown
        by the installer. Pick a domain name for your site. Create a new virtual
        host which includes the auto-generated Apache configuration (path mentioned
        by the installer). Then configure your DNS. A new Apache virtual host could
        simply look like this::
        
            <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerName YOUR-SITE-DOMAIN-NAME
                Include YOUR-SITE-PATH/var/httpd-autogenerated.conf
            </VirtualHost>
        
        The path to the auto-generated file must be an absolute path (not a relative path).
        
        After restarting, your virtual host will show a page saying 'Welcome to Quant'.
        You will be able to login with username 'admin' and password 'pass'.

        Please note at the moment, Quant is developed and tested on Ubuntu 10.10 (64 bit)
        with Python 2.6 only, although it should work on any recent Linux distribution.
