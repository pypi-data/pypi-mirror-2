Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The HSCustom theme was originally created for my band. The band died but the theme lives on!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add ``Products.HSCustom`` to the ``eggs`` parameter of your
        ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` section::
        
            [plone]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                Products.HSCustom
        
        Now run buildout, restart Plone, and install the theme in Site Setup ->
        Add-ons.
        
        .. Note::
        
            This theme generally looks terrible; it's just for fun (and the Plone 4
            support needs some work.)
