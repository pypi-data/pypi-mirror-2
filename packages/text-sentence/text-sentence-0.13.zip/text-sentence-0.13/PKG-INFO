        - is roman number,
        - is sentence end,

        Check `Getting started`_.
        
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        Installation instructions - if you have installed pip package
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip::
        
        pip install text-sentence
        
        If not, then do it old-fashioned way:
        - download zip from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/text-sentence/
        - unzip
        - open shell
        - go to distribution directory
        - python setup.py install
        
        Development version you can see at http://bitbucket.org/trebor74hr/text-sentence.
        
        or Mercurial clone with::
        
        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/trebor74hr/text-sentence
        
        GETTING STARTED
        ===============
        Usage example - start python shell::
        
        >>> from text_sentence import Tokenizer
        >>> t = Tokenizer()
        >>> list(t.tokenize("This is first sentence. This is second one!And this is third, is it?"))
        [T('this'/sent_start), T('is'), T('first'), T('sentence'), T('.'/sent_end),
        T('this'/sent_start), T('is'), T('second'), T('one'), T('!'/sent_end),
        T('and'/sent_start), T('this'), T('is'), T('third'), T(','/inner_sep),
        T('is'), T('it'), T('?'/sent_end)]
        
        More samples can be found in tests:
        
        http://bitbucket.org/trebor74hr/text-sentence/src/tip/text_sentence/test_sentence.txt
        
        Further
        -------
        Since there is currently no good documentation, the best source of
        further information is by reading tests inside of module and
        tests test_sentence. More information in `Running tests`_.
        You can allways read a source.
        
        
        DOCUMENTATION
        =============
        Currently there is no documentation. In progress ...
        
        
        SUPPORT
        =======
        Since this project is limited by my free time, support is limited.
        
        
        REPORT BUG OR REQUEST FEATURE
        -----------------------------
        If you encounter bug, the best is to report it to the bitbucket web page
        http://bitbucket.org/trebor74hr/text-sentence.
        
        The best way to contact me is by mail (find in LICENCE).
        
        TODO list is in readme.txt (dev version).
        
        
        CONTRIBUTION
        ============
        Since this project is not currently in the stable API phase, contribution
        should wait for a while.
        
        
        RUNNING TESTS
        =============
        All tests are doctests (not unittests). There are two type of tests in the
        package:
        
        1. doctests in module i.e. in __init__.py
        2. doctests in test_sentence.txt
        
        Running module directly will run 1. and 2.
        
        To run tests:
        - goto text_sentence directory
        - run tests by running module, e.g.::
        
        > python __init__.py
        __main__: running doctests
        test_sentence.txt: running doctests
        
        - other with::
        
        > python -m"text_sentence"
        
        TODO
        ====
        various things, see readme.txt in dev version for details.
