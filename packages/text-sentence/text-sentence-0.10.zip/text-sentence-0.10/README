All tests are doctests (not unittests). There are two type of tests in the
package: 

    1. doctests in module i.e. in __init__.py
    2. doctests in test_sentence.txt 

Running module directly will run 1. and 2. 

To run tests:
    - goto text_sentence directory
    - run tests by running module, e.g.::

        > python __init__.py
        __main__: running doctests
