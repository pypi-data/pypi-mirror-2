Application Configuration 
=========================

Each deployment of an application written using :mod:`pyramid` implies a
specific *configuration* of the framework itself.  For example, an
application which serves up MP3s for user consumption might plug code into
the framework that manages songs, while an application that manages corporate
data might plug in code that manages accounting information.  :mod:`pyramid`
refers to the way in which code is plugged in to it for a specific
application as "configuration".

Most people understand "configuration" as coarse settings that inform the
high-level operation of a specific application deployment.  For instance,
it's easy to think of the values implied by a ``.ini`` file parsed at
application startup time as "configuration".  :mod:`pyramid` extends this
pattern to application development, using the term "configuration" to express
standardized ways that code gets plugged into a deployment of the framework
itself.  When you plug code into the :mod:`pyramid` framework, you are
"configuring" :mod:`pyramid` for the purpose of creating a particular
application deployment.

Imperative Configuration
------------------------

Here's one of the simplest :mod:`pyramid` applications, configured
imperatively:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from paste.httpserver import serve
   from pyramid.configuration import Configurator
   from pyramid.response import Response

   def hello_world(request):
       return Response('Hello world!')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       config = Configurator()
       config.begin()
       config.add_view(hello_world)
       config.end()
       app = config.make_wsgi_app()
       serve(app, host='0.0.0.0')

We won't talk much about what this application does yet.  Just note
that the "configuration' statements take place underneath the ``if
__name__ == '__main__':`` stanza in the form of method calls on a
:term:`Configurator` object (e.g. ``config.begin()``,
``config.add_view(...)``, and ``config.end()``.  These statements take
place one after the other, and are executed in order, so the full
power of Python, including conditionals, can be employed in this mode
of configuration.

Configuration Decorations and Code Scanning
-------------------------------------------

An alternate mode of configuration lends more *locality of reference* to a
:term:`configuration declaration`.  It's sometimes painful to have all
configuration done in imperative code, because you may need to have two files
open at once to see the "big picture": the file that represents the
configuration, and the file that contains the implementation objects
referenced by the configuration.  To avoid this, :mod:`pyramid` allows you to
insert :term:`configuration decoration` statements very close to code that is
referred to by the declaration itself.  For example:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from pyramid.response import Response
   from pyramid.view import view_config

   @view_config(name='hello', request_method='GET')
   def hello(request):
       return Response('Hello')

The mere existence of configuration decoration doesn't cause any
configuration registration to be made.  Before they have any effect on
the configuration of a :mod:`pyramid` application, a configuration
decoration within application code must be found through a process
known as a :term:`scan`.

The :class:`pyramid.view.view_config` decorator above adds an
attribute to the ``hello`` function, making it available for a
:term:`scan` to find it later.

:mod:`pyramid` is willing to :term:`scan` a module or a package and
its subpackages for decorations when the
:meth:`pyramid.configuration.Configurator.scan` method is invoked:
scanning implies searching for configuration declarations in a package
and its subpackages.  For example:

.. topic:: Imperatively Starting A Scan

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:

      from paste.httpserver import serve
      from pyramid.response import Response
      from pyramid.view import view_config
     
      @view_config()
      def hello(request):
          return Response('Hello')

      if __name__ == '__main__':
          from pyramid.configuration import Configurator
          config = Configurator()
          config.begin()
          config.scan()
          config.end()
          app = config.make_wsgi_app()
          serve(app, host='0.0.0.0')

The scanning machinery imports each module and subpackage in a package
or module recursively, looking for special attributes attached to
objects defined within a module.  These special attributes are
typically attached to code via the use of a :term:`decorator`.  For
example, the :class:`pyramid.view.view_config` decorator can be
attached to a function or instance method.

Once scanning is invoked, and :term:`configuration decoration` is
found by the scanner, a set of calls are made to a
:term:`Configurator` on behalf of the developer: these calls represent
the intent of the configuration decoration.

In the example above, this is best represented as the scanner
translating the arguments to :class:`pyramid.view.view_config` into a
call to the :meth:`pyramid.configuration.Configurator.add_view`
method, effectively:

.. ignore-next-block
.. code-block:: python

   config.add_view(hello)

Declarative Configuration
-------------------------

A third mode of configuration can be employed when you create a
:mod:`pyramid` application named *declarative configuration*.  This mode uses
:term:`ZCML` to represent configuration statements rather than Python.  ZCML
is often used when application extensibility is important.  Most of the
examples in the narrative portion of this documentation concentrate on
imperative configuration rather than ZCML, but almost everything that can be
configured imperatively can also be configured via ZCML.  See
:ref:`declarative_chapter` for more information about ZCML.
