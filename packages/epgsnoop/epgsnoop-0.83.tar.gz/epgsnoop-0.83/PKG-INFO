        epgsnoop
        ========
        
        epgsnoop is a python package which wraps the dvbsnoop program
        and generates XMLTV data. The data is usable for MythTV and
        other PVR systems which support the XMLTV data format.
        
        epgsnoop is only currently known to be in use in New Zealand.
        Many of the processors are possibly currently targetted to the
        EIT data from there. Corrections and additions are welcome.
