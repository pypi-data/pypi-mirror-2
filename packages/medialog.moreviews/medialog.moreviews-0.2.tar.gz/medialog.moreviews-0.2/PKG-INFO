Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product is ONLY for Plone 4.
        Its a product where I will put views so its easy to reuse them elsewhere.
        It adds two views, one "folder view" and one "image view".
        The views are quite equal, but the "visualbox" one is for folders or topics with images.
        The "folder_visual_view" is for folders or topics with news items (or images)
        Be aware: dont use the view on a folder with "aggreator".
        Also note that the views are typicall for for something that the users shall not edit (in other words, there is no "view", add etc. menu".
        If you need that, edit the views and change:
        Fill slot from
        content-core <= content
        
        
        There are several profiles, some with just different effects on js.... (fade / animate etc)
