Introduction
============

This product is ONLY for Plone 4.
It adds two views for folders, topics and news items

Be aware: dont use the view on a folder with "aggreator".

Views so far:
- bigger_news_item (news item view with a bigger image)
- blank_news_item (news item view without image)
- newsitem_imageview ( a view for news items. You probably only want to use this in a folder with "full folder view / all content"
- visualbox (folder view for images)
- folder_visualbox (folder view for images and news items)

There are two alternative javascripts.  You can enable them by using the different profiles or by going to /portal_javascript
