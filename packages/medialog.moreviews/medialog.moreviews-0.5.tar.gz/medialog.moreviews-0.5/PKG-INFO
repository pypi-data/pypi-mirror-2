Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product is ONLY for Plone 4.
        It adds two views for folders, topics and news items
        
        Be aware: dont use the view on a folder with "aggreator".
        
        Views so far:
        - bigger_news_item (news item view with a bigger image)
        - blank_news_item (news item view without image)
        - newsitem_imageview ( a view for news items. You probably only want to use this in a folder with "full folder view / all content"
        - visualbox (folder view for images)
        - folder_visualbox (folder view for images and news items)
        
        There are two alternative javascripts.  You can enable them by using the different profiles or by going to /portal_javascript
