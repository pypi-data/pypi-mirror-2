With this package you can easily use the PayPal NVP API in your Python or
Zope / Plone based environment. It supports the ExpressCheckout and
DirectPayment API from PayPal.

You will need a `PayPal Developer Account <https://developer.paypal.com/>`_.

Please note, that the DirectPayment API does only work with US or UK
business accounts.
