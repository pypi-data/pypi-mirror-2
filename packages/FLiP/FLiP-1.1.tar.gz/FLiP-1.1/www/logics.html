<a href="index.html"><b>Flip</b></a> is a
logical framework written in Python.  Flip is called a framework
because it supports different logics and is extensible.  We can add
another logic to Flip, or add axioms and derived rules, by writing a
module in Python.  It is not necessary to know a great deal about
Python to add a logic to Flip.  Just follow the directions here and
imitate the logics already provided.

<p>
The logics included with Flip are listed in the <a
href="reference-nd.html#logics">reference</a>.  The <a
href="userguide-nd.html">user's guide</a> shows how a logic can be 
used in proof.

<p>
A logic module defines a language for writing formulas, and
inference rules for deriving new formulas from given formulas.  
Other modules integrate the logic with the proof checker.

<h3><a name="language">Language</h3>

<p>
A logic module can define a language for writing formulas.  

<p>
To define operators or other formula types, define formula classes in
the module.

<p>
In Flip, every formula and subformula is an instance of a class. In
particular, there is a class for each logical operator.  For example,
consider the formula And(p,Or(q,r)).  Here And is a class.  This whole
formula is an instance of the And class; in fact, it is the
constructor expression for that instance.  Here also, Or is a class,
the subformula Or(q,r) is an instance of the Or class, and p, q, and r
are instances of the Letter class.

<p>
We define a language for a logic by defining a class for each kind of
formula or subformula that can occur.  For example, here is the 
definition of the class And:

<pre>
class And(InfixLogical):
  """
  And(a,b) means a & b in Kaye. Capitalize And, distinguish from Python keyword
  """
  def __init__(self, *args):
    InfixLogical.__init__(self, *args)
    self.symbol = '&'
</pre>

<p>
This is the entire class definition.  Most of its work is done in the
base class InfixLogical.  We usually define classes by subclassing
base classes from the formula module, especially these:

<p>
Function, Relation, InfixRelation, PrefixLogical, InfixLogical, Quantifier

<hr>

<h3><a name="rules">Inference rules</h3>

<p>
A logic module can define inference rules for deriving new formulas
from given formulas.  

<p>
To define rules, put a dictionary named _rules in the module.  Each rule
is an entry in this dictionary, where the key is the rule name and the
value is the rule itself.

<p>
In Flip, every inference rule is a list of formulas, with the premises
first and the conclusion last.  The formulas in an inference rule may
contain placeholders that can be matched against formulas from a
proof.  For example, here is the dictionary entry for a simple
inference rule, And-Introduction (which we abbreviate ai):

<p>
<pre>
  ai :  [ m1, m2, And(m1,m2) ]
</pre>

<p>
This rule says that from premises m1 and m2, we can conclude
And(m1,m2).  The premises m1 and m2 are placeholders that match any
formula, and the conclusion And(m1,m2) uses these placeholders.  When
a proof is checked, m1 and m2 are bound to the actual premises cited
in the proof, and the conclusion in the proof is checked against And(m1,m2)
with those bindings for m1 and m2 substituted in their places.

<p>
An axiom is just an inference rule with no premises.  For example,
Reflexivity (of Equality, refl) is an axiom:

<pre>
  refl :  [ Equal(t1,t1) ]
</pre>

<p>
Here is a rule that uses a subproof. Implication-Introduction (impli):

<pre>
  impli :  [[ m1, m2], Impl(m1,m2) ]
</pre>

<p>
This rule says we need a subproof with premise m1 and conclusion m2.
From that subproof, we can conclude the implication Impl(m1,m2).
Notice how the subproof is indicated by a nested list.

<p>
Here is a rule that illustrates substitution, named Substitution (sub):

<pre>
  sub :  [ Equal(t1,s1), S1(t1), S1({t1:s1}) ]
</pre>

<p>
From the premise Equal(t1,s1), and from another premise S1 possibly
containing the term t1, we can conclude S1 where zero or more
occurrences of t1 have been replaced by the term s1.  The placeholder
S1 indicates a formula where optional substitutions may be performed.
The substitution is described here by a Python dictionary with a
single key t1 (the source of the substitution) associated with value
s1 (the replacement).

<p>
Here is a rule that has a subproof with
substitutions. Exists-Elimination (Ee):

<pre>
  Ee :  [ E(v1, P1(v1)), [Let(v2,P1({v1:v2})), Q1({v2:None})], Q1({v2:None}) ]
</pre>

<p>
This rule describes how to eliminate the existential quantifier that
appears in E(v1, P1(v1)).  We need a subproof that begins with the
formula P1 from the body of the quantifier, where all occurrences of
the bound variable v1 are replaced by the new free variable v2.  The
Let formula introduces the new variable, and the placeholder P1
indicates a formula where the substitution must be performed on every
occurrence.  The subproof concludes with the placeholder
Q1({v2:None}), which indicates a formula where the variable v2 does
not occur free.  From this subproof, we can conclude the formula Q1.

<p>
Much of the information in the inference rules is carried by the
placeholders.  Flip defines these placeholders.  Each placeholder (on
the left) matches an instance of the class (on the right) that
satisfies the given condition.

<p>
<table>
<tr><td>m1, m2</td><td>Formula</td></tr>
<tr><td>v1, v2</td><td>Variable</td></tr> 
<tr><td>t1, t2, s1</td><td>Term (including Variable)</td></tr> 
<tr><td>S1(t1)</td><td>Formula, may contain term t1</td></tr>
<tr><td>S1({t1:s1})</td> <td>Formula, where
 <em>some</em> (zero or more) occurrences of t1 <em>may</em> be replaced by term s1</td></tr>
<tr><td>P1(t1)</td><td>Formula, may contain t1</td></tr>
<tr><td>P1({t1:s1})</td><td>Formula, where 
  <em>all</em> occurrences of t1 <em>must</em> be replaced by s1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Q1({v2:None}) &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Formula, where 
   variable v2 does <em>not</em> occur free</td></tr> 
</table>

<p>
In the S1 and P1 patterns, the source, replacement, or both can be
restricted to variables by {v1:t1}, {t1:v1}, or {v1:v2}.  Flip checks
side conditions on substitution: neither the source nor the
replacement can contain a variable that is bound in the scope where the
substitution occurs.

<p>
Flip checks additional side conditions when variable placeholders
occur in these formulas:

<p>
<table>
<tr><td>New(v1)</td>
  <td>Variable v1 must not already appear free in the proof <td></td><tr>
<tr><td>Let(v1, P1(v1)) &nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
   <td>v1 must not already appear free<td></td><tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="modules">Modular structure</h3>

<p>
A logic module is a Python module that contains formula class
definitions and/or inference rules.  To use a logic in proofs,
we must also provide a configuration module that loads the logic into
the checker, and a session module that makes its identifiers available
in a proof session.

<p>
Imitate existing modules.  Compare fol_session, prop_session, and
prop_constructive_session.  Then compare the configuration modules
they import.

<p>
The classes and rules used in a single proof session are usually
divided among several logic modules.  This allows different logics to
be configured without duplication.  For example, prop_session imports
from prop_classic and prop_common, while prop_constructive_session
imports from prop_constructive and prop_common.  The fol_session
module imports from fol, prop_classic, and prop_common.

<p>
Some logic modules define inference rules but no formula classes; they
just use operators defined elsewhere.  This is the usual way to add
axioms and derived rules.  For example, prop_classic,
prop_constructive, and prop_derived each define different inference
rules, but they all use the operators defined in prop_common.
