The index.html is duplicated here as well as under www/ to avoid
broken links.  I put a placeholder index.html in this directory back
in March 2009 and Google has been indexing it since then.

The two index.html are not exact duplicates.  In the version here,
the links point to pages under www/ not to the same directory.
