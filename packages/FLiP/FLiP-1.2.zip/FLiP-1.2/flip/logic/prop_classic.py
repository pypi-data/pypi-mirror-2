"""
Additional propositional logic rules from Kaye, ch 6, defn. 6.3, p. 65.
Supplements rules in prop_common.
This module is an alternative to prop_derived or prop_constructive.

# Additional rules for propositional logic from Kaye

#  but both Bornat and H&R use a different form.
# Also Not-elim is here, only classical, not allowed in constructive.

# Rule symbols are self-evaluating, used to write proof in save file format
