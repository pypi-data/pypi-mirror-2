"""
Natural deduction proof checker for forward proofs, in Kaye's format.
This module manages proof state, provides proof commands, print/display, save.
The formula module provides formula representation, matching, and substitution.
The various logic modules define the logic languages and inference rules.
The config modules configure this checker with various logics.
The session modules are preludes for interactive sessions with various logics.
The test modules are self contained, configure the checker for test case logic.
