1.4.0 (2010-07-08)
==================

- Took zope.securitypolicy refactoring and zope.testing.doctest deprecation

  fewer dependencies than the existing one, which talks to the publisher.

1.3.0 (2009-07-23)
==================

- Updgraded pacakge to lxml 2.2.

- Fixed bug with `normalized_contents` which would break the `open` function
  of test browser if content wasn't parsable as HTML/XML.

1.2.0 (2008-05-29)
==================

- Added `normalized_contents` attribute that reindents and normalizes the
  etree structure of a document and allows easier to read HTML/XML examples in
  doctests.
