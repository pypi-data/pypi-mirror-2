Version 2.0 is finally here thanks to Saberre for solving the 401 issue!
Currently, python-twitpic supports the full API.

Version 2.0 Usage
=================

*NOTE*: The TwitPicOAuthClient does NOT support fetching an access_token. Use your 
favorite Twitter API Client to retrieve this. An access_token is required in most API calls.

GET based calls do not require any keys or tokens but for the rest of they API calls,
they are required.

There are 4 main methods that can be called. read, create, update, and remove which are your 
GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods (or at least attempting to simulate that).
Below is an example on how to make a call to upload an image. Notice
that the first param is your method call and the second is the required parameters
needed for the given method call. 

    import twitpic2
    twitpic = twitpic2.TwitPicOAuthClient(
        consumer_key = CONSUMER_KEY,
        consumer_secret = CONSUMER_SECRET,
        access_token = ACCESS_TOKEN,
        service_key = SERVICE_KEY
    )
    # methods - read, create, update, remove    
    response = twitpic2.create(METHOD_CALL, PARAMS)
    print response

Version 2.0 usage via command-line
==================================

*NOTE*: The command-line version only supports image uploading.

$ twitpic2.py --help
Usage: twitpic2.py -k CONSUMER_KEY -s CONSUMER_SECRET -a ACCESS_TOKEN -t SERVICE_KEY -m TWEET -f FILE

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k CONSUMER_KEY, --consumer_key=CONSUMER_KEY
                        Twitter consumer API key
  -s CONSUMER_SECRET, --consumer_secret=CONSUMER_SECRET
                        Twitter consumer API secret
  -a ACCESS_TOKEN, --access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
                        Twitter Access Token
  -t SERVICE_KEY, --service_key=SERVICE_KEY
                        Twitpic API key
  -m MESSAGE, --message=MESSAGE
                        The tweet that belongs to the image.
  -f FILE, --file=FILE  The file upload data.

Version 1.0 Usage
=================

*NOTE*: TwitPic has stated that they will continue supporting version 1.0. 
We recommend using 2.0 because it provides better security. TwitPic version 1.0
only supports image uploading.

    import twitpic
    twit = twitpic.TwitPicAPI('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD')
    twitpic_url = twit.upload('FILE_LOCATION')
    # twitpic_url = twit.upload('FILE_LOCATION', message='messages rock!')
    print twitpic_url

Version 1.0 usage via command-line
==================================

$ twitpic.py --help

Usage: twitpic -u USER_NAME options IMG_PATH

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user=USER  Twitpic user name
  -p PASSWD, --passwd=PASSWD Twitpic password
  -b, --both            post to twitter together
  -m MSG, --msg=MSG     message
