Description: IOSSHy - SSH tunnel spawner
        ===========================
        IOSSHy provides an easy to use desktop tool to quickly create and destroy SSH tunnels and launch commands based on a preconfigured setup.
        
        Password are stored in the keyring provided by the operating system (ES: gnome's keyring, kde's kwallet, osx keychain, etc...)
        
        .. contents::
        
        Usage
        -----
        When the program is launched, the main interface is hidden and only the icon in the system tray is shown.
        By clicking the tray icon, a configuration dialog will appear which allows to specify the tunnel configurations.
        
        A tunnel configuration consists of a name, the remote port that has to be forwarded locally, the local port (leaving this value to 0 will let IOSSHy choose a free high numbered port), an optional command to execute, and the ssh server details (host, port, and username). The password will be asked when needed.
        
        The command line may contain a special string "{port}" (without quotes) that will be replaced by the local port used for the tunnel, making it possible to write commands like::
        
        	rdesktop localhost:{port}
        
        SSH public key authentication methods are supported through the ssh agents provided by each operating system (putty's pageant is supported).
        
        Example use case
        ''''''''''''''''
        Create a SSH tunnel to a remote host on the MySQL port (3306) and launch a program that uses the tunnel to access the database as if it was installed locally.
        When the program terminates the tunnel is automatically closed.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The application should work reasonably well on all the platforms where the dependencies can be satisfied (Linux, \*BSD, OSX, Windows, ...),
        but at this point has only been tested on Linux operating systems and Windows XP 32bit.
        
        Packages
        ''''''''
        The following packages are available:
        
         * `Windows 32bit installer <http://cloud.github.com/downloads/mtorromeo/iosshy/iosshy-win32-1.4.exe>`_
         * `Arch Linux <http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=34495>`_
         * `Source tarball <http://github.com/mtorromeo/iosshy/tarball/v1.5>`_
        
        The code is hosted on `github <http://github.com/mtorromeo/iosshy>`_
        
        Clone command::
        
        	git clone git://github.com/mtorromeo/iosshy.git
        
        Dependencies
        ''''''''''''
        IOSSHy is a **python 2.6+** application and it also depends upon the following external libraries:
        
         * PyKDE4 (Optional for better KDE4 integration)
         * PyQt4 (4.6+)
         * paramiko
         * keyring
         * setproctitle
         * PyCrypto (For unix only)
        
        Build instructions
        ''''''''''''''''''
        Before using this applications the Qt forms and icon resources must be compiled.
        There is a unix shell script in the root of the distribution package named *build.sh* that takes care of this process::
        
        	cd [SOURCE FOLDER]
        	sh build.sh
        	chmod 755 bin/iosshy
        	bin/iosshy
        
        CHANGELOG
        ---------
        
        New in version 1.5

         * Included missing file from sdist (Fixes #6)
         * Removed problematic unique application check (will return in future versions)
        
        New in version 1.4
         * Removed PyCrypto requirement on Windows
         * Implemented check for application already running on KDE
         * Fixed message "Closing tunnel" being shown multiple times
        
        New in version 1.3
         * Fixed crash on application quit
         * Settings are saved as soon as the configuration dialog is closed

        New in version 1.2
         * Called required Random.atfork in tunnel thread, to ensure RNG thread safety
         * Suppressed RandomPool deprecation warning (paramiko should fix this)
