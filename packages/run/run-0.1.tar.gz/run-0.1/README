 python-run
============

This module provides convenient ways to guarantee a certain script
state. 

``run.alone``
=============

Make sure only one instance of the program is running,
this is done by acquiring an fcntl file lock on the
current script:

    >>> import run.alone

Caveats
-------

There are a few things to keep in mind:

1. import run.alone once, it will exit your program if it gets
   imported twice

2. symlinked scripts will be resolved to the inode it has been
   linked to, this is a limitiation of using fcltn file locks

``run.until``
=============

Run until a specified timespec, if the process runs
longer, it will be killed:

    >>> import run
    >>> run.until('23m42s')
    >>> ...

You can also choose to limit on the amount of CPU-time
being consumed (default is wall clock time):

    >>> run.until('42s', 'cpu')
    >>> ...
