Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.formwidget.autocomplete is a z3c.form widget for use with Plone. It
        uses the jQuery Autocomplete widget, and has graceful fallback for non-
        Javascript browsers.
        
        There is a single-select version (AutocompleteSelectionFieldWidget) for
        Choice fields, and a multi-select one (AutocompleteMultiSelectionFieldWidget)
        for collection fields (e.g. List, Tuple) with a value_type of Choice.
        
        When using this widget, the vocabulary/source has to provide the IQuerySource
        interface from z3c.formwidget.query and have a search() method.

        =========
        
        1.1 (2010-08-25)
        ----------------
        
        * Force the inserted HTML radio buttons to be interpreted as HTML
          instead of text.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
          context is not wrapped into an aquisition chain.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
          absolute URL.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Use the same display template for single- and multi-selection:   
          The single selection display template was non functional before.
          The value of a single selection field is wrapped in a list anyways
          so the multiselection template renders the single selection field
          just fine.
          -> https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10495
        
        * Update widget in the autocomplete-search browser view:
          The self.context.update() call rebinds to source which previously
          was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
          sources that only work after security is applied.

        1.0 - 2010-04-19
        ----------------
        
        * Issue 107: plone.formwidget.autocomplete: problems in IE8 when changing value
          Added a JavaScript work around, which dechecks all existing radio fields before
          adding a new one which is checked.
          [jbaumann]
          
        * Made the widget work properly in Zope 2.12.
          [optilude]
        
        1.0b3 - 2009-06-29
        ------------------
        
        * Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
          namespace traversal (++add++...)
          [optilude]
        
        1.0b2 - 2009-04-08
        ------------------
        
        * Fix security validator to work with urls not including the @@ view name.
          [optilude]
        
        * Made widget use getURL() instead of constructing URL from underlying
          view. This makes it work with complex traversal logic.
          [optilude]
        
        1.0b1 - 2008-08-28
        ------------------
