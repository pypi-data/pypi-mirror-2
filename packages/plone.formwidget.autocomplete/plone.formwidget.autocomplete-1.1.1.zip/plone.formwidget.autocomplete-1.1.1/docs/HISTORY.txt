Changelog
=========

1.1.1 (2011-02-11)
------------------

* Explicitly include CMFCore's zcml in demo.zcml, for compatibility
  with Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

1.1 (2010-08-25)
----------------

* Force the inserted HTML radio buttons to be interpreted as HTML
  instead of text.
  [dukebody]

* Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
  context is not wrapped into an aquisition chain.
  [dukebody]

* Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
  absolute URL.
  [dukebody]

* Use the same display template for single- and multi-selection:   
  The single selection display template was non functional before.
  The value of a single selection field is wrapped in a list anyways
  so the multiselection template renders the single selection field
  just fine.

* Update widget in the autocomplete-search browser view:
  The self.context.update() call rebinds to source which previously
  was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
  sources that only work after security is applied.

1.0 - 2010-04-19
----------------

* Issue 107: plone.formwidget.autocomplete: problems in IE8 when changing value
  Added a JavaScript work around, which dechecks all existing radio fields before
  adding a new one which is checked.
  [jbaumann]
  
* Made the widget work properly in Zope 2.12.
  [optilude]

------------------

* Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
  namespace traversal (++add++...)
  [optilude]

1.0b2 - 2009-04-08
------------------

* Fix security validator to work with urls not including the @@ view name.

  view. This makes it work with complex traversal logic.
  [optilude]
