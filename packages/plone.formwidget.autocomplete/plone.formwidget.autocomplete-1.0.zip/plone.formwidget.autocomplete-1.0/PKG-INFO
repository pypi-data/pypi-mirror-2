Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.formwidget.autocomplete is a z3c.form widget for use with Plone. It
        uses the jQuery Autocomplete widget, and has graceful fallback for non-
        Javascript browsers.
        
        There is a single-select version (AutocompleteSelectionFieldWidget) for
        Choice fields, and a multi-select one (AutocompleteMultiSelectionFieldWidget)
        for collection fields (e.g. List, Tuple) with a value_type of Choice.
        
        When using this widget, the vocabulary/source has to provide the IQuerySource
        interface from z3c.formwidget.query and have a search() method.

        ----------------
        
        * Issue 107: plone.formwidget.autocomplete: problems in IE8 when changing value
        Added a JavaScript work around, which dechecks all existing radio fields before
        adding a new one which is checked.
        [jbaumann]
        
        * Made the widget work properly in Zope 2.12.

        1.0b3 - 2009-06-29
        ------------------
        
        * Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
        namespace traversal (++add++...)

        1.0b2 - 2009-04-08
        ------------------
        
        * Fix security validator to work with urls not including the @@ view name.
        [optilude]
        
        * Made widget use getURL() instead of constructing URL from underlying
        view. This makes it work with complex traversal logic.
