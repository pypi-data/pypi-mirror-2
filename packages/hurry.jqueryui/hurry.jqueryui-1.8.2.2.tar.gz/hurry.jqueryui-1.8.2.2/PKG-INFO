        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery UI`_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware
        of jQuery UI's structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        .. _`jQuery UI`: http://jqueryui.com/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery UI from ``hurry.jqueryui`` and ``.need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          from hurry.jqueryui import jqueryui
        
          .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
          jqueryui.need()
        
        You can also use JQuery UI themes:
        
          from hurry.jqueryui import smoothness
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and
        ``hurry.resource``, and making sure that the original resources
        (shipped in the ``jqueryui-build`` directory in ``hurry.jqueryui``)
        are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and the Zope
        Toolkit. If you depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your
        ``setup.py``, the above example should work out of the box. Make sure
        to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.jqueryui before release
        =======================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of
        ``hurry.jqueryui``.  
        
        The javascript code that this package relies on is not checked into
        subversion to sidestep the copyright policy of svn.zope.org. Instead,
        just before release to pypi, an entry point is triggered that
        downloads the appropriate javascript code. To trigger this automated
        behavior you should do the release using ``bin/fullrelease``, which
        uses zest.releaser configured with the appropriate entry points.
