Description: # lang-detect: a tool to detect language
        
        Detecting the language for a small piece of unicode text without any dependency
        to other libraries.
        
        Currently we support detecting de, en, es, fr, it, ja, nl, pl, ru, zh-hans,
        zh-hant, and zh-yue.
        
        After some simple testing, we found that the result for long sentence is better.
        
        ## Method
        
        We focus on the Basic Multilingual Plane in unicode encoding, and current
        language support set could be extended.
        
        For each language, we use a uniformed ngram vector to represent the language
        itself. This vector can be seen at the data folder.
        
        When we detect a text, we generate the uniformed ngram vector for this text, and
        just comparing the cosine value of the angle between the text vector and the
        language vector.
        
        To get the language vector, we use feature articles on Wikipedia as corpus.
        
        ## Usage
        
        cd to the project root
        
        bin/langdetect YOUR_SENTENCE_HERE
