----------------

- stderr in svn update is no longer filtered but printed on console.
  [icemac]


2.2 (2008-06-07)
----------------

- Updated `fake-zope-eggs` handling, to be called when updating, so changes
  to `skip-fake-eggs` and add `additional-fake-eggs` are respected.
  [hannosch]

- Added new `skip-fake-eggs` option, that allows to skip the creation of
  fake eggs for a list of packages, so you can for example require a newer
  `zope.tal` version.
  [hannosch]

- Include the Python version Zope is compiled with into the shared-zope name.
  This allows you to have the same Zope version compiled with for example
  Python 2.3 and 2.4 but still share it. The change means, you will have to
  recompile all Zope versions.
