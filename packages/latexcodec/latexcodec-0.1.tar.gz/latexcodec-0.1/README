Latex codec
===========

This package installs a new codec named 'latex', which allows 
to convert byte strings (meaning standard Python 2 strings)
into an equivalent that has all special characters expressed
as Latex commands.

Currently, only encoding is supported:

>>> import latexcodec
>>> print u"Peter Tr\xf6ger".encode("latex")
Peter Tr\"oger

The conversion table is generated from the Latex utf-8 inputenc package,
which should make sure that all relevant characters are covered.

The functionality of this package somehow is a hack, since LaTex encoding
is not really a codec. 

The future plan is to implement this alternatively as invalid character error handler, 
or as transformation codec starting from Python 3.3.
