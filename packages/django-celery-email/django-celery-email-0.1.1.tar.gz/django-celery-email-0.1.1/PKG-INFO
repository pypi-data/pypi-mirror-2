Description: =================================================
        django-celery-email - Django Celery Email Backend
        =================================================
        
        A `Django`_ 1.2+ email backend that uses a `Celery`_ queue for out-of-band sending
        of the messages.

        Using django-celery-email
        =========================
        
        To enable ``django-celery-email`` for your project you need to add ``djcelery_email`` to
        ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += ("djcelery_email",)
        
        You must then set ``django-celery-email`` as your ``EMAIL_BACKEND``::
        
            EMAIL_BACKEND = 'djcelery_email.backends.CeleryEmailBackend'
        
        By default ``django-celery-email`` will use Django's builtin ``SMTP`` email backend 
        for the actual sending of the mail. If you'd like to use another backend, you 
        may set it in ``CELERY_EMAIL_BACKEND`` just like you would normally have set 
        ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` before you were using Celery. In fact, the normal installation
        procedure will most likely be to get your email working using only Django, then
        change ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` to ``CELERY_EMAIL_BACKEND``, and then add the new
        ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` setting from above.
        
        If you need to set any of the settings (attributes) you'd normally be able to set on a 
        `Celery Task`_ class had you written it yourself, you may specify them in a ``dict``
        in the ``CELERY_EMAIL_TASK_CONFIG`` setting::
        
            CELERY_EMAIL_TASK_CONFIG = {
                'queue' : 'email',
                'rate_limit' : '50/m',
                ...
            }
        
        After this setup is complete, and you have a working Celery install, sending
        email will work exactly like it did before, except that the sending will be
        handled by your Celery workers.
