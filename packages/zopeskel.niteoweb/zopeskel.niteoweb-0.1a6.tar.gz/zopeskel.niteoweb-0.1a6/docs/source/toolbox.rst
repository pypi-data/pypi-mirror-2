Outsourcing email, issue tracker, subversion repository, backups
================================================================

Let's say you charge $50 per hour for your work. If you have only a few hours of maintenance per year to do on your email/issuer-tracker/svn server, you've already spent more than you would have if you'd paid someone else to take care of these services. And you'll have far more than 2 hours per year of maintenance work. Plus, your multi-purpose server will surely go down when you are on holidays. Every single time.


Subversion repository and issuer tracker
----------------------------------------
I'd recommend using Unfuddle as you both of the above mentioned in on place. Commit messages can be nicely linked to issues and vice-versa. Also, they offer free plans for small projects, after that the plans start at $9/month.

Email
-----

Use Rackspace Email. I've learned the hard way that saving money when choosing email provider is plain stupid. A quality one ensures your emails get delivered on time, every time and into one's inbox instead of SPAM folder.
They are a bit on the upper with the price being $2 per mailbox per month, but it's worth it.


Backups
-------

Our recommendation is JungleDisk. It's basically the same as DropBox, but with no size limits and with data encryption. 
For starters you can easily use Desktop Edition, which costs $3/month plus $0.15 per GB/month.


.. note::
    
    JungleDisk allows you to choose where you want to store your data, Rackspace Cloud or Amazon S3. Both options cost the same for 1GB/month of storage, but Amazon S3 also charges for incoming and outgoing bandwidth. Ergo, Rackspace Cloud is a better pick here, obviously.

Sum
---

After following my advice and creating a free account at Unfuddle, creating 2 mailboxes at Rackspace Email and setting up a cca. 8GB backup disk at JungleDisk, your monthly running costs are less than $10 ($0 + $4 + $4). A small price to pay for having a good night sleep, every night.
