Description: Starting, deploying and maintaining Plone 4 projects made easy
        ==============================================================
        
        zopeskel.niteoweb is collection of ZopeSkel templates to help you standardize
        and automate the task of starting, deploying and maintaining a new Plone
        project. Its particularly helpful for less experienced Plone developers as 
        they can get a properly structured and deployed Plone 4 project in no time.
        A complete tutorial on how to use these templates for your own projects is
        at http://ploneboutique.com.
        
        It will help you to automate and standardize:
        
        * Starting a new Plone 4 project that includes old- and new-style python,
          zope page template and css overrides, collective.xdv, etc.
        * Adding your own functionalities and look to Plone 4.
        * Staging and deploying your Plone 4 project on Rackspace Cloud server instance
          running CentOS, with Nginx in front and secured with iptables firewall
          (only $11 per month per instance!)
        * Maintaining and upgrading your Plone 4 project on the production server.
        
        
        By default the Plone 4 project you create with these templates is equiped with:
        
        * latest collective.xdv with sample rules.xml and template.html,
        * .svnignore files to ignore files/folders that should not be stored inside
          your code repository,
        * base.cfg that holds global configuration for your buildout,
        * versions.cfg that pins all your eggs to specific versions to ensure
          repeatability,
        * development.cfg that builds a development environment,
        * production.cfg that builds a production environment with ZEO,
        * sphinx.cfg that is used to generate documentation for your code,
        * test_setup.py that shows you how to write tests for your project,
        * fabfile.py with Fabric commands to automatically deploy your code and data
          to a Rackspace
          Cloud server instance running CentOS,
        * Sphinx documentation for your project,
        * nginx.conf template to setup the Nginx web-proxy in front of your Zope,
        * basic iptables configuration to deny access on all ports but the ones you
          actually use,
        * munin-node.conf template to setup Munin system monitor node on your
          production server,
        * and many more smaller goodies.
