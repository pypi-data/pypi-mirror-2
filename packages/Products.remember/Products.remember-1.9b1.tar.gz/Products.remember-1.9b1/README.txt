Overview
========

Products.remember is a full implementation of the default Plone member
configuration using content to represent membership accounts.  It is built
on top of Products.membrane.  Out of the box, Products.remember should work
very much like a regular Plone membership accounts, except that member
information is stored in Member objects that are (by default) stored in the
portal_memberdata tool.

Products.remember 1.9b1 works with Plone 4+ and Products.membrane 2+.  It
does not suppport Plone 3 and Products.membrane 1.  See versions of
Products.remember before 1.9, eg 1.1b3.  (Visit
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.remember for the index of all
available Products.remember releases.)

Products.remember is a successor to CMFMember, which will not work with
PluggableAuthService-based user folders, and thus will not work with a
typical Plone 2.5 (and greater) installation.  Products.remember 1.1b3
provides a migration path for existing CMFMember-based sites.

INSTALLATION
============

Products.remember is packaged using Python's setuptools package management
infrastructure.  Remember can be made available to your Zope instance by
installing the Products.remember package into your Zope's python
environment, using either easy_install or 'python setup.py install'.

Products.remember is installed into a Plone site by the application of a
GenericSetup extension profile.  You can do this when creating a new
site by selecting remember from the list of available setup profiles
when you are creating the site.  In an existing site, you can use
Plone's regular product installation interface.
