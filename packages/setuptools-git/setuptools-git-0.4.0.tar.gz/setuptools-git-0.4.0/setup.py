long_desc="""
This is a plugin for setup tools that enables Git integration.  Once
installed, Setuptools can be told to include in a module distribution
all the files tracked by git.  This is an alternative to explicit
inclusion specifications with MANIFEST.in.

This package was formerly known as gitlsfiles.  The name change is the
result of an effort by the setuptools plugin developers to provide a
uniform naming convention."""
