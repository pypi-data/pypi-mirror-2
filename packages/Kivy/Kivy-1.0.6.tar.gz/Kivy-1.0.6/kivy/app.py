'''
Application
===========

The :class:`App` class is the base for creating Kivy applications.
Think of it as your main entry point into the Kivy run loop.  In most cases, you
subclass this class and make your own app. You create an instance of your
specific app class and then, when you are ready to start the application's life
cycle, you call your instance's :func:`App.run` method.


Creating an Application by Overriding build()
---------------------------------------------

To initialize your app with a widget tree, override the build() method in
your app class and return the widget tree you constructed.

Here's an example of very simple application that just shows a button:

.. include:: ../examples/application/app_with_build.py
   :literal:

The file is also available in the examples folder at
:file:`kivy/examples/application/app_with_build.py`.

Here, no widget tree was constructed (or if you will, a tree with only the root
node).


Creating an Application via kv File
------------------------------------

You can also use the :doc:`api-kivy.lang` for creating application. The .kv can
contain rules and root widget definitions at the same time. Here is the same
example as the Button one in a kv file.

Contents of 'test.kv':

.. include:: ../examples/application/test.kv
   :literal:

Contents of 'main.py':

.. include:: ../examples/application/app_with_kv.py
   :literal:

See :file:`kivy/examples/application/app_with_kv.py`.

The relation between main.py and test.kv is explained in :func:`App.load_kv`.

        widget tree has been constructed before for this app.
        This method then looks for a matching kv file in the same directory as
        the file that contains the application class.

        For example, if you have a file named main.py that contains::

            class ShowcaseApp(App):
                pass

        This method will search for a file named `showcase.kv` in
        the directory that contains main.py. The name of the kv file has to be
        the lowercase name of the class, without the 'App' postfix at the end
        if it exists.

        You can define rules and a root widget in your kv file::

            <ClassName>: # this is a rule
                ...

            ClassName: # this is a root widget
                ...

        There must be only one root widget. See the :doc:`api-kivy.lang`
        documentation for more information on how to create kv files. If your
        kv file contains a root widget, it will be used as self.root, the root
        widget for the application.
