<p>There are many ways in which you can contribute to Kivy.
Code patches are just one thing amongst others that you can submit to help the
project. We also welcome bug reports, feature requests, documentation
improvements, advertisement &amp; advocating, testing, graphics contributions and
many different things. Just talk to us if you want to help, and we will help you
help us.</p>
<div class="section" id="code-contributions">
<h2>Code Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#code-contributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Code contributions (patches, new features) are the most obvious way to help with
the project&#8217;s development. Since this is so common we ask you to follow our
workflow to most efficiently work with us. Adhering to our workflow ensures that
your contribution won&#8217;t be forgotten or lost. Also, your name will always be
associated with the change you made, which basically means eternal fame in our
code history (you can opt-out if you don&#8217;t want that).</p>
<div class="section" id="git-github">
<h3>Git &amp; GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#git-github" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We use git as our version control system for our code base. If you have never
used git or a similar DVCS (or even any VCS) before, we strongly suggest you
take a look at the great documentation that is available for git online.
The <a class="reference external" href="http://book.git-scm.com/">Git Community Book</a> or the
<a class="reference external" href="http://gitcasts.com/">Git Screencasts</a> are both great ways to learn git.
Trust us when we say that git is a great tool. It may seem daunting at first,
but after a while you&#8217;ll (hopefully) love it as much as we do. Teaching you git,
however, is well beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p>Also, we use <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> to host our code. In the following we
will assume that you have a (free) GitHub account. While this part is optional,
it allows for a tight integration between your patches and our upstream code
base. If you don&#8217;t want to use GitHub, we assume you know what you do anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-workflow">
<h3>Code Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#code-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So here is the initial setup to begin with our workflow (you only need to do
this once to install Kivy). Basically you follow the installation
instructions from <a class="reference internal" href="guide/installation.html#dev-install"><em>Installing Kivy for Development</em></a>, but you don&#8217;t clone our repository,
but the fork you create with the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to GitHub</li>
<li>Create a fork of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tito/kivy">Kivy repository</a> by
clicking the <em>fork</em> button.</li>
<li>Clone your fork of our repository to your computer. Your fork will have
the git remote name &#8216;origin&#8217; and you will be on branch &#8216;master&#8217;.</li>
<li>Compile and set up PYTHONPATH or install (see <a class="reference internal" href="guide/installation.html#dev-install"><em>Installing Kivy for Development</em></a>).</li>
<li>Install our pre-commit hook that ensures your code doesn&#8217;t violate our
styleguide by executing &#8216;make hook&#8217; in your clone. This will run our
styleguide check whenever you do a commit, and if there are violations in
the parts that you changed, your commit will be aborted. Fix &amp; retry.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, whenever you want to create a patch, you follow the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>See if there is a ticket in our bug tracker for the fix or feature and
announce that you&#8217;ll be working on it if it doesn&#8217;t yet have an assignee.</li>
<li>Create a new, appropriately named branch in your local repository for
that specific feature or bugfix.
(Keeping a new branch per feature makes sure we can easily pull in your
changes without pulling any other stuff that is not supposed to be pulled.)</li>
<li>Modify the code to do what you want (e.g., fix it).</li>
<li>Test the code. Try to do this even for small fixes. You never know
whether you have introduced some weird bug without testing.</li>
<li>Do one or more minimal, atomic commits per fix or per feature.
Minimal/Atomic means <em>keep the commit clean</em>. Don&#8217;t commit other stuff that
doesn&#8217;t logically belong to this fix or feature. This is NOT about
creating one commit per line changed. Use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span> <span class="pre">-p</span></tt> if necessary.</li>
<li>Give each commit an appropriate commit message, so that others who are
not familiar with the matter get a good idea of what you changed.</li>
<li>Once you are satisfied with your changes, merge with our upstream
repository. We can pull your stuff, but since you know best what you
changed, you should do the merge.</li>
<li>Push to your remote repository on GitHub.</li>
<li>Send a <em>Pull Request</em> with a description of what you changed via the button
in the GitHub interface of your repository. (This is why we forked
initially. Your repository is linked against ours.)</li>
</ol>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Note:</strong></dt>
<dd>When you change parts of the code base that require compilation, you
will have to recompile in order for your changes to take effect. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span>
<span class="pre">build</span></tt> command will do that for you (see the Makefile if you want to execute
the steps manually). If you need to clean your current directory from compiled
files, execute <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">clean</span></tt>. If you want to get rid of <strong>all</strong> files that are
not under version control, run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">distclean</span></tt>
(<strong>Caution:</strong> If your changes are not under version control, this
command will delete them!)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we will receive your pull request. We will check whether your changes are
clean and make sense (if you talked to us before doing all of this we will have
told you whether it makes sense or not). If so, we will pull them and you will
get instant karma. Congratulations, you&#8217;re a hero!</p>

<h2>Documentation Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation-contributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Documentation contributions generally follow the same workflow as code
contributions, just a bit more lax. We don&#8217;t ask you to go through all the
hassle just to correct a single typo. For more complex contributions, please
consider following the suggested workflow though.</p>
