        Changes in version 0.6.0 (released 2011-08-23)
        ==============================================
        
        * Ctrl-Q now quits.  (LP: #750092)
        
        * Fixed UnboundLocalError.  (LP: #778285)  Given by Jeroen Langeveld.
        
        * Ported from PyGTK to GI. This supports GTK 2 and GTK 3 with GI now, but still
          works with PyGTK.
        
          Packager's note: If you want to use GI, you need to change the package's
          dependencies from pygtk to the package that provides the GTK and Pango
          typelibs (e. g. gir1.2-gtk-2.0 and gir1.2-pango-1.0 on Debian/Ubuntu). It
          also requires pygobject >= 2.27.1.

        * Hide the main window on Esc.  Fixes LP: #716257.
        
          Contributed by Vladislav Naumov (https://launchpad.net/~vnaum).
        
        
        Changes in version 0.5.0 (released 2011-01-28)
        ==============================================
        
        * Switched from Glade to GtkBuilder.  This fixes those strange theme problems
          GTimeLog had with Ubuntu's Radiance and especially Ambiance. (LP: #644393)
        
          Packagers note: src/gtimelog/gtimelog.glade is gone, it was replaced by
          src/gtimelog/gtimelog.ui.  It needs to be installed into
          /usr/share/gtimelog/.
        
        * GTimeLog now supports Ubuntu's application indicators.  There's a new
          configuration option, ``prefer_app_indicator``, defaulting to true.
          Fixes LP: #523461.
        
        * GTimeLog tries to detect your theme color and make the tray icon dark or
          bright, for good contrast.  This is a hack that doesn't work reliably, but
          is better than nothing.  Fixes LP: #700428.
        
          Packagers note: there's a new icon file,
          src/gtimelog/gtimelog-small-bright.png.  It needs to be installed into
          /usr/share/gtimelog/.
        
        * Made GTimeLog a single instance application.  Requires python-dbus.
          The following command line options are supported::
        
            gtimelog --ignore-dbus
                always launch a new application instance, do not start the DBus service
        
            gtimelog --toggle
                if GtimeLog already running, show or hide the GTimeLog window,
                otherwise launch a new application instance
        
            gtimelog
                if GtimeLog already running, bring the GTimeLog window to the front,
                otherwise launch a new application instance

          Fixes LP: #356495.
        
        * New option: start_in_tray.  Defaults to false.  Contributed by Bruce van der
          Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk), as part of his patch for LP:
          #356495.
        
        * New command-line option: --tray.  Makes GTimeLog start minimized, or exit
          without doing anything if it's already running.
        
        * Added some documentation for contributors: HACKING.txt.
        
        * Daily reports include totals by category.  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys
          <laurynas@pov.lt>.
        
        * The tasks pane can be toggled by pressing F9 and has a close button.
        
        * Alternative weekly and monthly report style, can be chosen by adding
          ``report_style = categorized`` to ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc.
          Contributed by Laurynas Speičys <laurynas@pov.lt>.
        
        * Bugfix: always preserve the order of entries, even when they have the same
          timestamp (LP: #708825).
        
        
        Changes in version 0.4.0 (released 2010-09-03)
        ==============================================
        
        * Added configuration variable 'chronological' to control initial view of
          either Chronological (True) or Grouped (False).  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
          <barry@python.org> (LP: #628876)
        
        * Recognize $GTIMELOG_HOME environment variable to use something other than
          ~/.gtimelog as the configuration directory.  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
          <barry@python.org> (LP: #628873)
        
        * Changed application name to 'GTimeLog Time Tracker' in the desktop file
          (Debian #595280)
