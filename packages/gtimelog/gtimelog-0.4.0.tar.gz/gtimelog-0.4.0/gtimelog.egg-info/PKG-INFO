        Changes in version 0.4.0 (released 2010-09-03)
        ==============================================
        
        * Added configuration variable 'chronological' to control initial view of
          either Chronological (True) or Grouped (False).  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
          <barry@python.org> (LP: #628876)
        
        * Recognize $GTIMELOG_HOME environment variable to use something other than
          ~/.gtimelog as the configuration directory.  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
          <barry@python.org> (LP: #628873)
        
        * Changed application name to 'GTimeLog Time Tracker' in the desktop file
          (Debian #595280)
        
        
        Changes in version 0.3.2 (released 2010-07-22)
        ==============================================
        
        * Double-clicking a category in task list tries hard to focus the input box
          (fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/608734).
        
        * Change default mailer to quote the command passed to x-terminal-emulator -e;
          this makes it work with Terminator (also tested with xterm and
          gnome-terminal).  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/592552.
        
          Note: if you've used gtimelog before, you'll have to manually edit
          ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change the mailer line from
        
            mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e mutt -H %s
        
          to
        
            mailer = x-terminal-emulator -e "mutt -H %s"
        
        * Use xdg-open by default for editing timelog.txt and opening spreadsheets.
          Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/592560.
        
          Note: if you've used gtimelog before, you'll have to manually edit
          ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc and change
        
            editor = gvim
            spreadhsheet = oocalc %s
        
          to
        
            editor = xdg-open
            spreadsheet = xdg-open %s
        
        
        Changes in version 0.3.1 (released 2009-12-18)
        ==============================================
        
        * Fixed broken sdist (by adding MANIFEST.in, since setuptools doesn't
          understand bzr by default).
        * Added Makefile for convenience (make distcheck, make release).
