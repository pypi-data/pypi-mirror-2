Change log for tl.buildout_gtk
==============================

0.2.1 (2010-12-30)
==================

- Updated pywebkitgtk to 1.1.8, removing the need for the build patch.

- Don't create the part directory unless all required projects have been built
  successfully. This allows buildout to trigger the recipe again later.

- Consider the build target paths of all required projects to belong to the
  part's file-system resources. This way, they get rebuilt if they were
  deleted after the previous buildout run.

- Make better use of pygobject's and pygtk's own mechanisms for selecting the
  Python interpreter to build against.


0.2 (2010-07-15)
================

- Added capability to build pywebkitgtk, activate by specifying
  ``pywebkitgtk = true``. Assumes webkit development files to be installed.

- Use zc.recipe.cmmi instead of the deprecated gocept.cmmi. We have shared
  builds now, so we inherited the ``shared`` option from zc.recipe.cmmi.

- Added ``pygtk`` and ``pygobject`` switches to avoid having to unset the
  respective URLs if a project is not to be built. Ensure dependencies between
  the various projects instead of complaining if they're not met.

- Updated software version defaults to pycairo 1.8.8 and pygobject 2.20.0.

- Moved the project to the Mercurial vcs, created a Bitbucket home for it and
  added an ABOUT.txt file listing the new resources.


0.1.1 (2009-05-14)
==================

- Allow for building only pycairo or only pycairo and pygobject by specifying
  empty url options for the projects not to be built.

- Updated software version defaults to pycairo 1.8.0, pygobject 2.17.0 and
  pygtk 2.15.0.
