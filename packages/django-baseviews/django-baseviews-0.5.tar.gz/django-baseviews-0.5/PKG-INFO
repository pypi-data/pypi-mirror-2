Description: Django-Baseviews
        ================
        
        A small collection of base view classes to build upon. They are intended to
        handle a lot of the repetition in common view patterns and allow you to focus
        on what makes each view different.  They've been in use in production on
        various PegasusNews.com apps since June, 2010.
        
        This is just the beginning, and I plan on expanding these classes and adding
        more to cover other common view patterns.  Feel free to fork and send pull
        requests - I'd be happy to review and integrate contributions.
