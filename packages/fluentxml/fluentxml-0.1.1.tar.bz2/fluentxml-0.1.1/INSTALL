Requirements
------------

 * python >= 2.6 [http://www.python.org/download/releases/]


Installation (as user)
----------------------

$ ./setup.py install --prefix=~/.local

This will install FluentXML under your ~/.local directory or in any other
directory you want. $chosen_directory/lib/python$x.$y/site-packages must be
in sys.path for Python to find the fluentxml module (starting with PythonÂ 2.6,
~/.local/lib/python$x.$y/site-packages is added to sys.path automatically;
see PEP 370 for more info).


Installation (as root)
----------------------

# ./setup.py install

If you're using a Python version older than current stable (2.6), the
default target directory is /usr, which should not be used for local
installations (i.e. outside your normal package management system). You
can override this default with a command-line option:

# ./setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local


Uninstall
---------

Distutils does not let us uninstall yet so you have to remove files
manually. :/


Getting help
------------

$ ./setup.py --help


Python 2.x
----------

You can install and use FluentXML with python 2.x (> 2.6). To do this
you must explicitly run the setup.py with the python 2 binary.

The fluentxml.py file can be imported with any version of python > 2.6.
So you have nothing in particular to do if you want to use it with
python 2 or 3.
