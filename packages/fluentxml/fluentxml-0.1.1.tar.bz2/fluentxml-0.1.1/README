Introduction
------------

FluentXML is an XML library released under GNU GPLv3. It provides a simple
interface to parse, create, query, edit and save XML in a pythonic way.

It was designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. So you do not need
to waste your time with a complicated and superfluous API. You can forget the
DOM, it was a bad dream. Just do what you do the best: write python code.
