Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Cufón aims to become a worthy alternative to sIFR, which despite its merits
        still remains painfully tricky to set up and use. To achieve this ambitious goal
        the following requirements were set:
        
        * No plug-ins required – it can only use features natively supported by the client
        * Compatibility – it has to work on every major browser on the market
        * Ease of use – no or near-zero configuration needed for standard use cases
        * Speed – it has to be fast, even for sufficiently large amounts of text
        
        And now, after nearly a year of planning and research we believe that these
        requirements have been met.
