Description: ============
        Lojban Tools
        ============
        
        This library most notably wraps camxes, a lojban parser generated by Rats!
        as a java jarfile.
        It also wraps vlatai from the jbofihe package, which does morphological
        analysis of lojban words.
        The third thing it wraps is makfa, which is a word lookup tool.
        
        Additional Dependencies
        -----------------------
        
        Since camxes is a java file, you need a **Java** virtual machine or something
        else that lets you run jarfiles. In addition to that, you also need the
        **jbofihe** package to get vlatai for morphological analysis and **makfa** for
        selma'o lookup (and more in the future).
