            ============
            Lojban Tools
            ============

            This library most notably wraps camxes, a lojban parser generated by Rats!
            as a java jarfile.
            It also wraps vlatai from the jbofihe package, which does morphological
            analysis of lojban words.
            The third thing it wraps is makfa, which is a word lookup tool.

            Additional Dependencies
            -----------------------

            Since camxes is a java file, you need a **Java** virtual machine or something
            else that lets you run jarfiles. In addition to that, you also need the
            **jbofihe** package to get vlatai for morphological analysis and **makfa** for
            selma'o lookup (and more in the future).""")
