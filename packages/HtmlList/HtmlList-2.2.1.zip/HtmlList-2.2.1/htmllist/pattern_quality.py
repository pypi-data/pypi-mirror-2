"""
This module tries to assess the quality of a pattern on an HTML page. It has
more information than the RepeatPattern classes because it sees the HTML page
itself (through the BreakHtmlPage class).

The only "public" function is "pattern_quality" that take RepeatPattern object
and BreakHtmlPage object and return a number between 0 and 1. The higher the
number the better the quality.

The current implementation checks the deviation of the number of words and the
number of tags in each section of a pattern in each occurrences. But in the
future I may change this assessment without having to change the usage of this
module.
