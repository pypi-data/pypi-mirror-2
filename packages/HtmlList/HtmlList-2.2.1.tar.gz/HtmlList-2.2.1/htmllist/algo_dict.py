"""
This is a data module that defines a dictionary that carry the different
RepeatPattern algorithms meta and optional configuration data. The keys of this
dictionary are the implementation classes of the algorithms. The values are an
AlgoData class (defined below), this class is similar to named-tuple.

There is a help function update_algo_dict to update this configuration
dictionary from a custom file. The file should define a Python dictionary of
dictionaries. The keys of the outer dictionary has to be the names of the
algorithms as they appear in the algo_dict below. The keys of the inner
dictionary has to be names in the FIELDS tuple you want to change.

This sample dictionary will change the "minimum coverage" of the Count Tags
algorithm and enable the Titles algorithm:

{
	"Count Tags": {
		"min_coverage": 0.5,
	},
	"Titles": {
		"enabled": True,
	},
}

This module is mainly for the htmllist_demo script, or for future modules that
will use HtmlList. Run as a script to see the algorithms meta-data.
