"""
Abstract base class for classes that break the HTML pages, produce a symbols
(tags) sequence for the RepeatPattern classes, get back the results, and
generate the HTML sub sections (these are the selected patterns).

As convention, to the symbols a RepeatPattern classes work with I call Tags,
and these are a tag_tools.Tag instances. To the symbols the sub classes of this
class works with I call Elements. An element object will be different in each
implementation of this base class, and the user should not call any of it's
methods. This class define a set of class-methods to work with an element
sequence.

This class has to "public" TagSet objects, "include_tags" if not empty, will
hold the tags to include (and only them), and "exclude_tags" if not empty, will
hold the tags to always exclude from the sequence returned by "get_tag_list".
See TagSet documentation for more details.

This class creates a singleton object.
