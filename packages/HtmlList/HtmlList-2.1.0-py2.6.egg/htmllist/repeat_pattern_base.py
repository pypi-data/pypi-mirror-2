"""
This is a base class for all algorithms of the repeat-pattern class.
It defines some common help methods and the classes interface.

I use two measurements for the pattern quality from the IEPAD paper
(http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=372182), Coverage and Compactness it is
working like a charm :) The Regularity measurement is identical to my nstdv
method. In addition I am using "weight" (see method doc).

The basic usage is something like:
	>>> rp = RepeatPattern()
	>>> rp.process(input_list)
	>>> print "The best pattern is:", rp.pattern
	>>> print "Indices of the pattern:", rp.indices_lst

This class is finding and returning multiple patterns. It is an iterator over
the patterns. When working with multiple patterns we need to set the
configuration parameter "max_patterns" to a number bigger then one. In order to
get the patterns do something like:

	>>> if rp.process(lst):
	>>> 	for i in rp:
	>>>			print rp.pattern
	>>>			print rp.indices_lst

* And there is also a sort method:

	>>> rp.sort(rp.INDICES)		# First pattern first
	>>> rp.sort(rp.PATTERN)		# Longest pattern first
	>>> rp.sort(rp.REPEATS)		# Prevalent pattern first
	>>> rp.sort(rp.FACTOR)		# best pattern first (the default)

There is also an option to work in a "lazy" mode when processing many pages from
the same source.
	>>> rp = RepeatPattern()
	>>> rp.process(input_list)
	For another page with the SAME format (new input_list)
	>>> rp.process_by_pattern(new_input_list)
	>>> print rp.indices_lst	# rp.pattern will not change

The methods "get_factor", "clean_indices", "break_indices_lst" and
"gather_occurrences" are for the RepeatPattern sub-classes use, but not for the
end user (kind of protected). For usage example see repeat_pattern.py (or any
other algorithm module).
