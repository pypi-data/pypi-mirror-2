Description: Overview
        ========
        
        The ZCatalog is Zope 2â€™s built in search engine. It allows you to categorize
        and search all kinds of Zope objects.
        
        It comes with a variety of indexes for different types of data.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.13.3 (2011-01-01)
        -------------------
        
        - Avoid locale-dependent test condition in `test_length_with_filter`.
        
        2.13.2 (2010-12-31)
        -------------------
        
        - Preserve `actual_result_count` on flattening nested LazyCat's.
        
        - Preserve the `actual_result_count` on all lazy return values. This allows
          to get proper batching information from catalog results which have been
          restricted by `sort_limit`.
        
        - Made sure `actual_result_count` is available on all lazy classes and falls
          back to `__len__` if not explicitly provided.
        
        - Optimized length calculation of Lazy classes.
        
        2.13.1 (2010-12-25)
        -------------------
        
        - Added automatic sorting limit calculation based on batch arguments. If the
          query contains a `b_start` and `b_size` argument and no explicit `sort_limit`
          is provided, the sort limit will be calculated as `b_start + b_size`.
        
        - Avoid pre-allocation of marker items in `LazyMap`.
        
        2.13.0 (2010-12-25)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix `LazyMap` to avoid unnecessary function calls.
        
        - Released as separate distribution.
