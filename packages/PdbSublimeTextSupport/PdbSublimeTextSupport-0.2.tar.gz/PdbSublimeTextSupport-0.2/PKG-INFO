Description:           This module is used to hook up ``pdb``, the python debugger, with Sublime Text 2,
                  enabling it to display the debugged source code during a ``pdb`` session.
        
                  After downloading and unpacking the package, you should install the
                  helper module using::
        
                      $ python setup.py install
        
                  Next you need to hook up ``pdb`` with this module by adding the
                  following to your ``.pdbrc`` file, which you can create in your home
                  directory if it's not there already::
        
                      from PdbSublimeTextSupport import preloop, precmd
                      pdb.Pdb.preloop = preloop
                      pdb.Pdb.precmd = precmd
                  
                  Finally, ensure that you have the ``subl`` command line tool has
                  been installed as per `these instructions
                  <http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html>`_.
        
                  Afterwards Sublime Text should get started automatically whenever
                  you enter a debug session.  The current source line will be
                  displayed simultaneously while stepping through the code.
        
                  This module is based on ``PdbTextMateSupport`` by Andi Zeidler
                  and others.
