          This module is used to hook up ``pdb``, the python debugger, with Sublime Text 2,
          enabling it to display the debugged source code during a ``pdb`` session.

          After downloading and unpacking the package, you should install the
          helper module using::

              $ python setup.py install

          Next you need to hook up ``pdb`` with this module by add the
          following to your ``.pdbrc`` file, which you can create in your home
          directory if it's not there already::

              from PdbSublimeTextSupport import preloop, precmd
              pdb.Pdb.preloop = preloop
              pdb.Pdb.precmd = precmd
          
          Next, you need to install the `SublimeProtocol Sublime Text 2 plugin
          <https://gist.github.com/1074202>`_. Download this and place the
          file ``createsublimelink.py`` in the Sublime Text 2 ``Packages/``
          directory (go to the menu item  Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences ->
          Browse Packages in Sublime Text to find) it.

          Finally, ensure that you have the ``subl`` command line tool has
          been installed as per `these instructions
          <http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html>`_.

          Afterwards Sublime Text should get started automatically whenever
          you enter a debug session.  The current source line will be
          displayed simultaneously while stepping through the code.

          This module is based on ``PdbTextMateSupport`` by Andi Zeidler
          and others.
