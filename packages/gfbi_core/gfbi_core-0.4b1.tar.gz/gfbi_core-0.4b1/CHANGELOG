 * The user can decide if he wants to force the committed date/author or let git update it.

gfbi_core 0.3 (28-05-2011)
==========================

Lots of API changes we made to match the need for gitbuster II new features (graphical rebase, remote repositories, fake repositories).

 * Using 'git cherry-pick' rather than 'git filter-base'.
 * The columns are now fixed.
 * Splitting the model to easily hide/show modifications with Qt's MVD.
 * Adding the possibility to add/remove commits of a model.
 * New history feature.
 * Deal with rebase conflicts and accept solutions.
 * Now we can also change the name of a branch.
 * New feature: create a fake model (the model is populated by inserting rows in gitbuster).
