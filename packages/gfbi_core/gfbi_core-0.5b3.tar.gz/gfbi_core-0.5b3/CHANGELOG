gfbi_core 0.5 (22-06-2011)
==========================

Main evolution: the new gitFilterRebase class, best of two worlds !

 * Now we deal with parents and children to provide accurate reordering in non flat histories.
 * New cache system to reduce the time for calculating rewrite dependencies.
 * Several optimizations for speed improvements.
 * Fixing git diff outputs blocking the write process (using --no-pager now).
 * Checking that the repository hasn't change to avoid data loss.
 * Fecthing original files doesn't require to reset the repository anymore (useful for gitbuster special mode).

gfbi_core 0.4 (03-06-2011)
==========================

 * Better providing of the unmerged files.
 * The user can decide if he wants to force the committed date/author or let git update it.
 * New API methods to get the first commit, to know if the name is modified.
 * Better dealing with the fake models.
 * Offering gitbuster to populate fake models by itself rather than in git_rebase_process.

gfbi_core 0.3 (28-05-2011)
==========================

Lots of API changes we made to match the need for gitbuster II new features (graphical rebase, remote repositories, fake repositories).

 * Using 'git cherry-pick' rather than 'git filter-base'.
 * The columns are now fixed.
 * Splitting the model to easily hide/show modifications with Qt's MVD.
 * Adding the possibility to add/remove commits of a model.
 * New history feature.
 * Deal with rebase conflicts and accept solutions.
 * Now we can also change the name of a branch.
 * New feature: create a fake model (the model is populated by inserting rows in gitbuster).
