Virtuoso Support for SQLAlchemy
===============================

The :mod:`virtuoso.alchemy` module defines a `SQLAlchemy`_
dialect for Virtuoso. Note that this is in the very early stages
of development and the more elaborate things that are possible
with SQLAlchemy may not work.

.. _SQLAlchemy: http://sqlalchemy.org

With this package installed and the requisite ODBC drivers configured,
you can create a SQLAlchemy engine by doing something like the
following:

.. code-block:: python

    from sqlalchemy.engine import create_engine
    engine = create_engine("virtuoso://dba:dba@VOS")

Implementation Details
----------------------

.. automodule:: virtuoso.alchemy
