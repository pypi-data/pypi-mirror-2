Virtuoso support for RDFLib
===========================

There is now some rudimentary support for a Virtuoso backed
store in RDFLib. It is incomplete and has some known bugs
(notably that you will experience it eating your languages
and datatypes on literals).

If you still want to experiment with it, you can use it by
installing this package and then,

.. code-block:: python

    from rdflib.store import Store
    from rdflib.plugin import get as plugin

    Virtuoso = plugin("Virtuoso", Store)
    store = Virtuoso("DSN=VOS;UID=dba;PWD=dba;WideAsUTF16=Y")

and then use this store as you would any other. This has been
tested with rdflib3 only and may or may not work with rdflib2.
