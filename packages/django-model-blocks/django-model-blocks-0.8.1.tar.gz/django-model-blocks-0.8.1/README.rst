====================
Django Model Blocks
====================

The ``model_blocks`` app provides you with automatically generated, stylable
generic Django templates. It fills a gap left by ``admin`` and ``databrowse`` by
providing filters and tags that allow your to painlessly create templates with 
the following properties:

* Automatically generated read-only views
* Can conform to whatever URL structure you want
* Can be placed as blocks on to your existing templates
* Integrate well with the rest of your project

Add this to the top of any template::

    {% load model_blocks %}

And drop the filter anywhere you have a model instance (e.g., DetailViews)::

    {{ object|as_detail_block }}

Quick Reference
---------------

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the ``model_blocks`` app from PyPI::

    $ pip install django-model-blocks

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Modify your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting to include::

    ...
    model_blocks,
    ...

If you plan on overriding any of ``model_blocks``'s default templates, remember
that ``app_directories.Loader`` searches apps in the order they are specified
in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Usage
~~~~~

Near the top of any template you want to use model blocks, or in a base 
template, include the following line::

    {% load model_blocks %}

Then, where you want to drop a generic model template, use::

    {{ object|as_detail_block }}

Or::

    {{ object_list|as_list_block }}

By default, the title on an object detail block will be the unicode
representation of the object, and the title on a list will be the name of the
model appended with `' List'`. To change the title, pass in a parameter::

    {{ object|as_detail_block:"My Special Object" }}
