What is CodMACs?

CodMACs is a meta-programming python implementation. It helps you to write programs (in any language) 
very quickly by generating source code based on SQL tables structure.
Turns a “hours taker” task into a “seconds taker” one.

First, it reads your databases in order to create a structure for you to include it into your code templates. 
The structure is simply a python class.
Then, the CodMACs core parses your code tamplates, interprets your CodMACs/python code and creates a source 
code file that includes your code and the result of evaluating the code written in CodMACs/python.
