Description: AutoRoleFromHostHeader PAS Plugin
        =================================
        
        Add roles to (anonymous or logged-in) visitors based on browser HTTP header
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        The AutoRoleFromHostHeader plugin allows to assign roles to users looking
        at client HTTP headers.
        
        There is an extraction and authentication plugin included, to enable
        additional roles for anonymous users. They are required since PAS does
        not support roles (or properties or groups) for anonymous users.
        You can disable these interfaces if only logged-in users should get
        additional roles.
        
        AutoRoleFromHostHeader furthermore provides a groups plugin interface,
        allowing you to assign groups instead of roles.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The plugin is configured by editing the **Header name, regexp and roles**
        property on the plugin's Properties screen. Each line represents a mapping
        from an header value (using a regexp match) to one or more roles. The format
        is as follows::
        
        http_header_name; regular expression; role[, role ...]
        
        Caveat
        ======
        
        If you have AutoRoleFromHostHeader configured for anonymous users and come
        from a network matching one of its rules, you will NOT be able to log in with
        an account from a higher-up user folder. This is because AutoRole authenticates
        the Anonymous User which stops the lookup process.
