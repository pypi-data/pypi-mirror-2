Description: Django-data-exports
        ===================
        
        Django-data-exports is a model data exports app for Django. It allows you to easily
        create exports for your models.
        
        Adding this app to your project will let you create exports for your models,
        and customize the data that will be exported by specifying which columns to include,
        and which format to use.
        
        Typical use case: display a few columns from one of your models as a HTML table to
        be easily copy/pasted to a spreadsheet.
