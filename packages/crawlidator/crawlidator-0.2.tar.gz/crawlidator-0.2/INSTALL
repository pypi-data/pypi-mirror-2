Crawlidator can be installed in two ways: by downloading the package and
installing it manually of by using pip.

Using pip
---------

Using pip is the easiest way to install crawlidator. It will autmatically
install the requirements. If you don't have pip installed yet, but you do have
easy_install on your system, install pip using easy_install (it's so much
better)::

    easy_install pip

And use pip to install crawlidator::

    pip install crawlidator

Or if you already have an older version of crawlidator installed and like to
upgrade::

    pip install --update crawlidator


Manual installation
-------------------

If you have downloaded the package:

1. Unpack it::

    tar -zxf crawlidator-0.2.tar.gz

2. Change to the crawlidator directory::

    cd crawlidator-0.2

3. Install

    python setup.py install
