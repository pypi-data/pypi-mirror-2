This is a debugging plugin for TiddlyWeb.

When {server_prefix}/env is accessed the current WSGI environment
is returned as text/plain, formatted with pprint.

You should not run this on your public TiddlyWeb server unless you 
are comfortable with sharing you entire configuration with the 
outside world.
