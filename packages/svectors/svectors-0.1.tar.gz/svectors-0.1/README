svectors 0.1
============

svectors is an efficient implementation of dot product computation on sparse
vectors and Jiang/Conrath similarity on the WordNet taxonomy.  At the moment,
there is no documentation for svectors.  Please have a look at the script
"demo.py" to get an idea of how to use it, or consult the source code!

The module "svectors" is the higher-level interface and should be preferred.
"_svectors" is the low-level machinery. It doesn't do much error checking and
it _will_ crash if you provide it with bad parameters.

Note: You need Python 3.0 or later to run svectors!
To build and install globally run (with appropriate permissions):
