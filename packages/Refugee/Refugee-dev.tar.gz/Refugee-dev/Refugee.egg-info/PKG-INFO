        A simple way to migrate your data without being tied to an orm.
        
        
        Design and Motivation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The use case for this design is to have a wrapper around sql and scripts that
        help version and control the migration process. This should do the following
        * require next to 0 setup
        * control all migrations in a transaction and assure that each applies cleanly
        * prevent migrations from being applied multiple times
        * attempt to merge long branches of migrations
