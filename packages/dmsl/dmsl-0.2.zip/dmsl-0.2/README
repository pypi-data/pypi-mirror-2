Building
========

daml depends on Cython >= 0.13 and lxml so install as per your distribution, for example

#> sudo aptitude install python-lxml
or
#> sudo easy_install lxml

After satisfying lxml dependancy, build and install globally with the following

#> sudo python setup.py install

or if you wish to not install globally, you can build the C extensions in place
and use from directory

#> python setup.py build_ext -i

Running
=======
To run unit tests:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  #> python test/

To use:

.. sourcecode:: python

  import daml
  daml._sandbox._open.template_dir = 'omg/seriously'
  daml.parse('index.daml', {'content': 'Hello World'})

Features and Examples
