collective.lastlogin Package Readme
===================================

Introduction
------------

With this package it's easy to get a list of the users of a Plone site
and the last time they logged in.

This package has been developed for a customer of `Zest Software`_ to
get an overview of active users. Only a minimal version was required
and that's exactly what this is.

configuration`__.  Then go to ``<plone_site>/@@lastlogin`` to get a
list of Plone users and the last time they logged in.
