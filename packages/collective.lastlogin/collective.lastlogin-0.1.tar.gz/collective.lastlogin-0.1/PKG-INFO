        Introduction
        ------------
        
        With this package it's easy to get a list of the users of a Plone site
        and the last time they logged in.
        
        This package has been developed for a customer of `Zest Software`_ to
        get an overview of active users. Only a minimal version was required
        and that's exactly what this is.
