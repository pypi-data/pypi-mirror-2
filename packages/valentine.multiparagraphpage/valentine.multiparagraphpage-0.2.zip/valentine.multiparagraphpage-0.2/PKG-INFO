Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Content type for Plone 3.x to provide separately managed paragraphs.
        Purpose of that solution is to provide complex layouts and ease translation of the content.
        As paragraphs are edited in separate editors even complex layouts may be kept untouched.
        
        We use ``valentine.multiparagraphfield`` to implement multi paragraph support and ``valentine.contentportlets``
        to provide portlets as paragraphs.
