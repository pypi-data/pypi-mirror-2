Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package shows how you might use collective.xdv / Diazo in a Plone site. It
        aims to be more verbose (and probably more redundant) than xdv-worked-example_.
        
        It's aimed towards developers, and it focuses especially on adding worked
        examples of more complex XSLT.  Eventually we're hoping to get the code
        examples in the xdv package itself, as they're not specific to Plone.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Include collective.examples.diazo in your buildout.
        
        There's a buildout on
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.examples.diazo/trunk/buildout.
        It won't work on Mac...yet.  But you can install collective.xdv on a Mac using
        statically compiled lxml, don't use the buildout contained here, but use the
        collective.examples.diazo by checking out the source to your /src directory
        and updating your own buildout.cfg and re-running buildout -N.
        
        Examples in this package
        ------------------------
        
        We do not have a single `static` directory. Instead, we have directories 
        for each theme.
        
        Themes:
        
        `collective-xdv-example`: the example from the collective.xdv product.

        Collective.xdv worked example
        -----------------------------
        
        The initial rulesfile was taken from the collective.xdv documentation.
        To this, we added:
        
        Multiple themes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We want to use a different theme for the "News" section. This is done using the
        <theme> directive. 
        
        We did this by setting a selector for the body element's content class::
            
            <theme href="theme.html" />
            <theme 
                href="theme-news.html" 
                css:if-content="body.section-news"
                />
        
        Note that we have to set the fallback theme. Failing to do so will result in an
        unthemed page.
        
        To use a specific theme for a content type, you can use another selector for
        the body element's class, ie::
        
            <theme href="theme.html" />
            <theme 
                href="theme-news.html" 
                css:if-content="body.portaltype-folder"
                />
        
        You could also theme for a specific template in this way.
        
        This only works on xdv >= 0.4b3, which the current KGS does
        not include. To force the right version of xdv, add this to your buildout::
        
            [versions]
            xdv = 0.4b3
        
        Including extra rules files
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To include an extra rules file, use the XInclude statement. You could use this
        statement to slit up a large rules file into separate files.
        
        For example, this rule in `rules.xml` calls another rules file `rules-standard.xml`::
        
            <!-- Stuff that happens on all pages -->
            <xi:include href="rules-standard.xml" />
        
        This one executes the `rules-document.xml`, but only for Plone Document
        objects::
        
            <!-- Stuff that happens on Plone's Documents (standard pages) only -->
            <rules css:if-content="body.portaltype-document">
                <xi:include href="rules-document.xml" />
            </rules>
