The orange_sunset theme example
-------------------------------

- The Orange Sunset theme was downloaded from oswd.org, a site with 
  Open Source Web Design templates.
- The original static HTML/CSS theme was developed by D Carter, while the 
  this collective.xdv-based theme was developed in collaboration with 
  the members of the Diazo sprint at the Bristol, U.K. Plone Conference, 
  October 30th, 2010. 
- Terms:  The downloaded zip file from oswd.org has a CSS file that refers
  to a license.txt that does not exist, but the author's website indicates
  the terms of the themes developed by DCarter.  These terms indicate that
  this theme should generally maintain the 'Design by DCarter' attribution
  in the footer of the page, or that a contribution should be made to its
  creator.  More information at:  http://www.dcarter.co.uk/terms.html
- Recommendation: This Diazo/xdv theme is meant to provide a nice reference
  for developers and designers who wish to leverage Diazo to theme their 
  own Plone-based websites (although the contained rules.xml could provide
  useful tips on rules syntax when attempting to use standalone XDV (or as
  part of a WSGI pipeline) to theme any type of web application.  This
  theme is not intended to be leveraged to theme your website directly. 

Hopefully. you'll find it useful as an example when building your own 
Diazo themes.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have obviously already installed the collective.examples.xdv product 
that contains the orange_sunset theme and its directory containing static
HTML, image, and CSS files.

Once you have installed the collective.examples.xdv product in your Plone 
site via the Site Setup -> Add Ons area (click checkbox next to this product 
and then click the 'Activate' button.)

Once you have activated the product, click on the new 'XDV theme' configlet 
link under the Add-on Configuration section of Site Setup.

In the 'Theme template' field enter:
python://collective.examples.diazo/static/orange_sunset/index.html

In the 'Rules file' field enter:
python://collective.examples.diazo/static/orange_sunset/rules.xml

In the 'Absolute URL Prefix' field enter::

    /++resource++collective.examples.diazo/orange_sunset

You can modify the 'Domains' box to use the IP and/or port that will work for reaching your 
Plone site.  It typically defaults to port :8080 on localhost, but if your Zope is running
on port 6000, change it to that.

Be sure to have the 'Enabled' checkbox at the top checked in order to 
have this theme applied to your site.

Note:  Do not try to enter '127.0.0.1:your-port' as one of the themed domains in your 
configuration, as the 127.0.0.1 address has been reserved, so that you always have a 
way to get back to viewing the unthemed-through-Diazo Plone website (in case you 
break your theme so badly when modifying your rules file that it renders the site 
unviewable.)


Extending
~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the rules.xml file in this distribution to adjust the existing theme 
mapping rules, create your own, or whatever.

To create your own theme, you might copy/paste the orange_sunset directory in 
this product's /static directory, rename the new directory to a unique name 
for your new theme, and then copy in whatever static html/css/images you'd like 
to use under that directory, as well as modify the rules.xml file in your new
Diazo theme directory.  We hope this jumpstarts your Diazo theme development!
