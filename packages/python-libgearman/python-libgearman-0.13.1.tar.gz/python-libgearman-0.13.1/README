These are the Python wrappers for libgearman.

To build them, setup.py expects to find libgearman/gearman_client.h and
libgearman/gearman_server.h in an include path and libgearman.so in a ld path.

If they are not in those places, you'll probably want to add CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to the command line. Or fix setup.py.

The C source here is generated from SWIG. That, as well as the larger build 
process of which it is a part and from which this source package is derived
can be checked out from launchpad via:

bzr branch lp:gearman-interface
