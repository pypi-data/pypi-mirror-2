You should be able to install this via:

python setup.py install --prefix=SOMEWHERE

I typically install via:

python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local

and then set up
PYVER=python2.6		# Or whatever your current python version is.
# This lets python find the modules in this package:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/local/lib/$PYVER/site-packages
# This lets this package find the necessary gpklib libraries:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
# Running setup.py installs some scripts, so you should put them on
# your search path:
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/local/bin

LIBRARIES REQUIRED:
gpklib ( from http://sourceforge.org/projects/speechresearch ).
