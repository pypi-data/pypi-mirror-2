        Download and docs:

        Description
        -----------
        
        Running edpath displays entries from the PATH (or other named environment
        variable), with ';' separators replaced by newlines, so that each entry is on
        its own line. Running with --edit displays this in $EDITOR, and saved changes
        are written back to the registry, where they will be picked up by all new
        processes.
        
        Run with --help for description and usage.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Microsoft Windows. Only tested on Windows XP.
        * Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.1
        * Package *pywin32*, from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/
        * Package *argparse*, using *easy_install*, or from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse
        
        Argparse is not required on Python 2.7, it is built into the standard library.
        
        
        Status and Known Problems
        -------------------------
        
        Feature complete. No known issues.
        
        If you have comments or it doesn't work for you or you find bugs, I'd love to
        hear about it. -tartley@tartley.com
        
        
        Todo
        ----
        
        * gracefully handle EDITOR not set or doesn't exist
        * modify setup.py to split readme by paras, not lines. see setup-fix.py
        * convert makefile to bin\.sh files?
        * reasess README / usage: which is for which audiences?
        * needs a canonical webpage for *users* (not python devs)
        * store backups of old PATH values in case user trashes their PATH?
        * option to output on stdout in ';' delimited form
        * make Linux-friendly. Presumably we can only display the output there, not persist it.
        
        
        Thanks
