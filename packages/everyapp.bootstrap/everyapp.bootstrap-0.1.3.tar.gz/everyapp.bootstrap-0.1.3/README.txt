About
=====

*everyapp.bootstrap* provides an enhanced and customizable virtualenv_
bootstrap script.  It aims to make it easy to bootstrap a virtual environment
for your project.

This distribution includes a tool to generate a bootstrap script that will
automatically create the virtual environment when run.  By placing the
bootstrap script in the root of your project's source tree and making it
available on a fresh checkout/clone from your version control repository, you
make it easy for anyone who wants to hack on your project (including yourself!)
to work in a consistent development environment.

Additionally, this enhanced bootstrap script can read a configuration file and
perform additional actions beyond just creating a bare-bones virtual
environment.

Features
========

* Easy creation of a virtualenv bootstrap script.
* Better defaults for virtualenv like using distribute_ instead of setuptools_
  and always unzipping eggs.
* Easy customization of the bootstrapping process.
* Automatic installation of additional distributions using pip_ and/or
  easy_install_.
* Easy customization of pip_ and easy_install_ behaviour during distribution
  installation.
* Automatically run additional commands after the bootstrapping is complete.

Status
======

This project is very young and the code should be considered *Alpha* quality.
It has been minimally tested on Linux and Windows, under Python 2.6 and 2.7,
but has not yet been seriously tested on any platform.

That said, it is largely just a wrapper and a few customizations on the
production-grade virtualenv_ project, so it should be reasonably stable.  It
should also be mostly feature complete.

Dependencies
============

``everyapp.bootstrap`` requires only distribute_ and virtualenv_.

Installation
============

The easiest way to install this distribution is::

  pip install everyapp.bootstrap

or::

  easy_install everyapp.bootstrap

For additional installation options and tips see the `doc/INSTALL.txt`_ file.

Usage
=====

In your project's root directory, run::

  mkbootstrap

This will generate a ``bootstrap.py`` script and a ``bootstrap.cfg``
configuration file.  Edit ``bootstrap.cfg`` as desired, then run::

  python bootstrap.py

This will create the virtual environment in the root directory for your
project.

For additional bootstrap script options and information see the documentation
and/or run the following commands::

  mkbootstrap --help
  python bootstrap.py --help
