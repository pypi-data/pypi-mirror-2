[pip]
## In this section, list all the distributions to automatically install with
## pip.  These would normally be the distributions needed for development, not
## the dependencies of your project, which should go in setup.py.
##
## Distribution versions can be specified either in PEP314/PEP345 format using
## parentheses (e.g. "pep8 (>=0.5,!=0.5.2,<0.6)") or in pip-compatible format
## without parentheses (e.g. "pep8>=0.5,!=0.5.2,<0.6").
##
## Note: Not all distributions are compatible with pip.  Use the [easy_install]
## section for those that are not (or use that section for all distributions).

## Requirements
# (none yet)

## Useful Tools
pep8 (>=0.5,<0.6)
pyflakes (>=0.4,<0.5)
ipython (>=0.10,<0.11)
docutils (>=0.7,<0.8)

[easy_install]
## In this section, list all the distributions to automatically install with
## easy_install.  These would normally be the distributions needed for
## development, not the dependencies of your project, which should go in
## setup.py.
##
## Distribution versions can be specified either in PEP314/PEP345 format using
## parentheses (e.g. "pep8 (>=0.5,!=0.5.2,<0.6)") or in easy_install-compatible
## format without parentheses (e.g. "pep8>=0.5,!=0.5.2,<0.6").


[commands]
## This section lets you automatically execute additional commands after the
## virtual environment has been created and all the specified distributions
## have been installed.  List one command (with any arguments) per line.

## Note: You can use the $bin$ token to indicate the virtual environment's bin/
## directory, which can have a different name on some platforms (e.g. Scripts\
## on Windows).  The trailing slash is also included.

$bin$python setup.py develop
