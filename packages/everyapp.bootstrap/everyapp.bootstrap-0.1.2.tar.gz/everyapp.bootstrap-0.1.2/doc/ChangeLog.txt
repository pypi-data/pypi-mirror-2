	* MANIFEST.in, README.txt, doc/AUTHORS.txt, doc/BUGS.txt,
	doc/COPYING.txt, doc/FAQ.txt, doc/HACKING.txt, doc/INSTALL.txt,
	doc/LICENCE.txt, doc/NEWS.txt, doc/THANKS.txt, doc/TODO.txt,
	etc/bootstrap.cfg, setup.cfg, setup.py, src/everyapp/__init__.py,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/__init__.py,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/bootstrap.cfg,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/customize.py,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/mkbootstrap.py:
	Fixed line ending compatibility and cleaned up README.txt.

	 * Since Windows-friendlyness is a priority for this project, all
	file line endings have been changed to \r\n. All new files
	should also be like that.
	 * All files are also utf-8 encoded without a BOM.
	 * Finally, since .txt extension is important for Windows-friendlyness
	and since bitbucket.org only renders .txt files as plain text,
	regardless of preamble, I have removed the formerly commented-out
	text from README.txt. The removed text can be added again later
	by copying it out of the previous revision.
	[683facc4674e]

	* README.txt, doc/TODO.txt, setup.py:
	Fixed up README.txt and updated TODO.txt.

	 * README.txt should now show up rendered on bitbucket.org.
	 * The link to source files in README.txt now point to tip and the
	$VERSION$ subsitution for sdist has been removed. This makes the
	links work even from bitbucket.org, though now releases will
	still point to tip instead of the correct release.
	 * When and if a mailing list is set up, it will be at librelist.com
	instead of Google Groups.
	 * Removed a few completed items from TODO.txt.
