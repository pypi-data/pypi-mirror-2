Description: 
        ghmiles is a Python library that generates a milestone model from the issues in
        a GitHub repository. ghmiles can optionaly generate an HTML page similar to a
        `Trac roadmap`_. 
        
        A milestone is a list of issues having the same label. The progress of a
        milestone is obtained by dividing the number of closed issues by the number of
        total issues. 
        
        Users of ghmiles can specify which labels identify a milestone by providing a
        regular expression.
