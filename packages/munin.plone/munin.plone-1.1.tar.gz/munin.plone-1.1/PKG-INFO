Description: 
        
        This package provides munin plugins for monitoring various aspects of a Plone
        instance.
        
        It uses `gocept.munin`_ for plugin registration. Please refer to its
        documentation if you want to write new plugins.
        
        Plugins
        -------
        
        Currently there is 1 plugin available:
        
        * "contentcreation" - reports content creation and modification taken
        from portal_catalog
        
        How to use it
        -------------
        
        * First include the package in your buildout `instance` slot::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        munin.plone
        zcml =
        ...
        munin.plone
        
        * To create the pluging helper script you'll also need to include the
        following, additional section and extend your `parts` definition::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        munin
        
        [munin]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = munin.plone
        arguments = http_address='${instance:http-address}', user='${instance:user}', plone='plone'
        
        The `arguments` option is used to pass configuration values to the generated
        helper script, which is then used as the actual munin plugin (see below).
        Any settings for `ip-address`, `http-address`, `port-base` and `user` given
        in the `instance` section should be repeated here, separated by commas.
        
        .. |---| unicode:: U+2014  .. em dash
        
        Please be aware, that the variable names use underscores instead of dashes
        here |---| the following list shows all supported settings and their
        respective default values:
        
        * ip_address='<ip-address>'    ['localhost']
        * http_address=<http-address>  [8080]
        * port_base=<port-base>        [0]
        * user=<user-credentials>      [n.a.]
        * plone=<plone-site-id>        ['plone']
        
        Either literal values or references to the `instance` part can be used here,
        i.e. "http_address='${instance:http-address}', user='${instance:user}'".
        Please note that the resulting line will be verbosely copied into the
        generated `bin/munin` script, so the extra quoting is required.
        
        * Now you should be able to call the plugins as follow::
        
        http://localhost:8080/plone/@@munin.plone.plugins/contentcreation
        
        Where `contentcreation` is you plugin name.  Please note that for security
        reasons the view requires the `View management screens` permission.
        
        * Next you need to make symlinks from the helper script inside your
        buildout's `bin/` to the munin plugin directory.  The helper script itself
        can assist you with this::
        
        $ bin/munin install /opt/munin/etc/plugins [<prefix>] [<suffix>]
        
        This will install the necessary symlinks in the given directory using
        either the provided prefix and suffix or else the hostname and current
        directory to assemble their names (see below).
        
        Alternatively, you may also install the desired symlinks yourself::
        
        $ cd /opt/munin/etc/plugins
        $ ln -s ~/zope/bin/munin company_contentcreation_site1
        
        Here `/opt/munin/etc/plugins` is your munin directory, `~/zope/` is the
        root directory of your buildout, `contentcreation` the name of the plugin
        you want to enable, `company` a placeholder for an arbitrary prefix and
        `site1` the name which will be shown in munin.
        
        * Finally configure the plugin in munin (this step can be skipped if you have
        correctly set up the `arguments` option as described in step 2 above)::
        
        $ cd /opt/munin/etc/plugin-conf.d/
        $ vi munin.plone.conf
        ... [company_*_site1]
        ... env.AUTH myuser:myuser
        ... env.URL http://localhost:8080/plone/@@munin.plone
        .plugins/%s
        
        Here `myuser:myuser` are your Zope user credentials and `localhost:8080`
        your site url.  Please check `munin`_ for more information about plugin
        configuration.
