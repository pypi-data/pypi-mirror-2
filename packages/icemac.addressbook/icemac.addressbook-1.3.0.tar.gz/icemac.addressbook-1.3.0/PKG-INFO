        ==============
        Installation
        ==============
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You only need Python 2.5. (Other python versions are currently not
        supported.)
        
        First installation
        ==================
        
        CAUTION: icemac.addressbook can't be installed using ``easy_install``,
        you have to follow these simple steps.
        
        Neither you need any root privileges nor it installs anything outside
        its directory.
        
        1. Download the source distribution (see Download_).
        
        2. Extract the downloaded file.
        
        3. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python, e. g.::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py
        
        4. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
        5. Run the tests. See `Run the tests`_
        
        6. Start the application. See `Run the application`_
        
        Update
        ======
        
        - When you are updating from version 0.3.x or earlier follow the steps
        described in `First installation`_ followed by the steps described
        in `Second part of steps for older versions`_.
        
        - When you are updating from version 0.4 or newer follow these steps:
        
        1. Download and extract the source distribution (see Download_) to a
        new a directory.
        
        2. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python added by the path
        to the previous installation. This way values you entered
        previously are used as defaults instead of the application
        defaults.  Example::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py ../icemac.addressbook-0.4
        
        3. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
        4. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        - If you get an error when running the application after updating
        which looks like::
        
        zope.app.generations.interfaces.UnableToEvolve: (..., u'icemac.addressbook', ...)
        
        Then you have to upgrade to version 0.5.x first and start the
        application, so that legacy data can be converted. Version 1.x is no
        longer compatible with these older versions.
        
        
        Second part of steps for older versions
        ---------------------------------------
        
        1. Stop the old instance of the application.
        
        2. Create a backup of the ZODB og the old instance using::
        
        $ bin/backup
        
        3. Copy the backup directory (``var/backups``) to the new instance.
        
        4. Restore the backup into the new instance using::
        
        $ bin/restore
        
        5. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        Run the tests
        =============
        
        Run the unit tests and functional tests using::
        
        $ bin/test
        
        Run the application
        ===================
        
        To run the application instance in foreground start using::
        
        $ bin/addressbook fg
        
        To run it as a demon process start using::
        
        $ bin/addressbook start
        
        To stop the demon process call::
        
        $ bin/addressbook stop
        
        The default URL is to access the application is::
        
        http://127.0.0.1:8080
        
        To log-in at this URL you need the username and password you chose
        when running ``install.py``. The are stored in ``admin.zcml``.
        
        Create a new address book using the `add address book` link on the
        right. How to create new users inside this address book is described
        in `Create new users`_.
        
        
        Change configuration of the installation
        ========================================
        
        The values you entered during installation resp. update are stored in
        a file named `install.user.ini` in the address book directory.
        
        To change the configuration values call `install.py` using python and
        enter a `.` as parameter like this::
        
        $ python2.5 install.py .
        
        The configuration questions get presented to you with your previously
        entered values as default.
        
        To remove additional packages you have to edit the ``[package]``
        section of `install.user.ini`. There is currently no other way for
        removal.
        
        =================
        User management
        =================
        
        Roles
        =====
        
        Access to the address book is only granted after authentication. There
        are three roles to authorize a user:
        
        - visitor: visit all person's data, search and export, change own
        password
        
        - editor: permissions of visitor + edit all person's data, change own
        log-in name
        
        - administrator: permissions of editor + create and change address
        book and users
        
        Create new users
        ================
        
        Users are persons from the address book augmented by log-in
        information.
        
        To create the first new user inside an address book the adminstrator
        (who was created in `First installation`_) has to log-in and then do
        the following:
        
        1. create a new person with an e-mail address using `Add person`.
        
        2. create a new user using `Master data --> Users --> Add user`.
        
        The newly created user has now a log-in (e-mail address) for the
        address book the person belonges to.

        ==================
        
        - Replaced `Simple single keyword search` by `Keyword search` which
        allows to search for multiple keywords concatenated by `and` or
        `or`.
        
        
        1.2.0 (2010-02-06)
        ==================
        
        - Feature: Added ability to clone a person.
        
        
        1.1.2 (2010-01-27)
        ==================
        
        - Search result table displayed only 50 entries. Now it displays all
        search results ordered by name.
        
        
        1.1.1 (2010-01-25)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed version of `icemac.ab.locales`.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2010-01-25)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Added translation to XLS export files.
        
        - Added creator, last modifier and modification date metadata to
        objects.
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        - When two users are exporting at the same time this could end in
        broken export files.
        
        - On the person edit form:
        
        - the the last modification dates of the entries (postal address,
        phone number etc.) where the one of the person.
        
        - the keywords field was not correctly implemented: it was always
        marked as changed so the a new last modification date on the
        person was set, even when nothing has been changed.
        
        - editing a field of an entry did not change the modification date
        of this entry but of the person.
        
        
        1.0.1 (2010-01-13)
        ==================
        
        - Bugfix: The value fields of a user defined field of type `choice`
        could not contain non ascii characters. This broke the usage of the
        field on any object.
        
        
        1.0.0 (2009-12-29)
        ==================

        - Displaying modification date of adresses now.
        
        - Dropped some package dependencies which existed for compatibility
        reasons with older versions. To upgrade to this version you might
        need to upgrade to 0.5.4 first. (See Update_.)
