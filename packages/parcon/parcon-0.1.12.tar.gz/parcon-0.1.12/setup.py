Parcon is a parser combinator library. It can be used for parsing both normal
text and binary data. It's designed to be easy to use and to provide informative
error messages.

Pargen, which is provided as a submodule of Parcon, is a formatter combinator
library. It's much the opposite of Parcon: while Parcon is used to parse text
into various objects, Pargen is used to format objects into text. As an
example, if you wanted to reimplement Python's json module, you would use
Parcon to implement json.loads and Pargen to implement json.dumps.

All of the classes, and most of the functions, in Parcon are comprehensively
documented. The best place to look for help is in Parcon's module documentation.

Here's an example of a simple expression evaluator written using Parcon::

    from parcon import *
    from decimal import Decimal
    import operator
    expr = Forward()
    number = (+Digit() + -(SignificantLiteral(".") + +Digit()))[flatten]["".join][Decimal]
    term = number | "(" + expr + ")"
    term = InfixExpr(term, [("*", operator.mul), ("/", operator.truediv)])
    term = InfixExpr(term, [("+", operator.add), ("-", operator.sub)])
    expr << term

This expression evaluator can be used thus::

    print expr.parseString("1+2") # prints 3
    print expr.parseString("1+2+3") # prints 6
    print expr.parseString("1+2+3+4") # prints 10
    print expr.parseString("3*4") # prints 12
    print expr.parseString("5+3*4") # prints 17
    print expr.parseString("(5+3)*4") # prints 32
    print expr.parseString("10/4") # prints 2.5

Parcon is currently much more comprehensively documented than Pargen is.
Improved documentation for Pargen will come soon.
