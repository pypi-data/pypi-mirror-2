PyXMPP2 â€“ Python Jabber/XMPP implementation
============================================

Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to rewrite PyXMPP so:

- it uses most current Python APIs
- its API is cleaned up
- etc.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 (Python 3.2 support coming soon)
- `DNSPython`_  Limited functionality is available without it.
