RsTeX
=====

RsTeX provides additional functionality over ``rst2latex``, which is a 
ReStructuedText to latex translator. It is based on ideas found in ``sphinx``
and provides a math role (``:math:``), reference role (``:ref:``), a math 
directive and a pure LaTeX "environment" with ``uspackage`` injection.
