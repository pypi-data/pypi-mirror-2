Version 1.9
===========

- Support binary image arrays and pixel list format WCS by presenting
  a way to call wcslib's wcsbth()

- Updated underlying wcslib to version 4.5, which fixes the following:

    - Fixed the interpretation of VELREF when translating
      AIPS-convention spectral types.  Such translation is now handled
      by a new special- purpose function, spcaips().  The wcsprm
      struct has been augmented with an entry for velref which is
      filled by wcspih() and wcsbth().  Previously, selection by
      VELREF of the radio or optical velocity convention for type VELO
      was not properly handled.

BUGS:

- The "pc" member is now available with a default "raw" Wcsprm object.

- Make properties that return arrays read-only, since modifying a
  (mutable) array could result in secondary values not being
  recomputed based on those changes.

- float properties can now be set using int values

Version 1.3a1
=============

Earlier versions of pywcs had two versions of every conversion method:

  X(...)      -- treats the origin of pixel coordinates at (0, 0)
  X_fits(...) -- treats the origin of pixel coordinates at (1, 1)

From version 1.3 onwards, there is only one method for each
conversion, with an 'origin' argument:

  - 0: places the origin at (0, 0), which is the C/Numpy convention.

  - 1: places the origin at (1, 1), which is the Fortran/FITS
    convention.
