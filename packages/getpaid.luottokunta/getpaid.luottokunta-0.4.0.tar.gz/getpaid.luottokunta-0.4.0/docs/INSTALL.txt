Installation
============

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, just do this:

* Add ``getpaid.luottokunta`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    |   [buildout]
    |   ...
    |   eggs =
    |       getpaid.luottokunta

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    |   [instance]
    |   ...
    |   zcml =
    |       getpaid.luottokunta
    |       getpaid.luottokunta-overrides # Comment out this if getpaid.paymentprocessors is installed.

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
