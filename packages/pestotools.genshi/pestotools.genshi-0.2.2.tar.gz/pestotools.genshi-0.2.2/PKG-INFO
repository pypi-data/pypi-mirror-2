        CHANGELOG
        
        Version 0.2.2
        
        * Added GenshiRender.docstring_as_string
        
        * Added support for Genshi filters to be passed in to render methods
          via the ``filter`` argument
        
        Version 0.2.1
        
        * Rewrote genshi_app function as a class for more flexibility
        
        Version 0.2
        
        * No longer export render/render_docstring functions that can be configured
          with global variables. Instead clients should create instances of GenshiRender
          to access properly configured decorators.
        
        * The @genshi decorator is now redundant and has been removed.
        
        Version 0.1.1
        
        * Values returned from decorated functions that can't be rendered are passed
          through unchanged wherever possible.
        
        Version 0.1
        
        * Initial release.
