CHANGELOG

Version 0.2

* No longer export render/render_docstring functions that can be configured
  with global variables. Instead clients should create instances of GenshiRender
  to access properly configured decorators.

* The @genshi decorator is now redundant and has been removed.

Version 0.1.1

* Values returned from decorated functions that can't be rendered are passed
  through unchanged wherever possible.

Version 0.1

* Initial release.
