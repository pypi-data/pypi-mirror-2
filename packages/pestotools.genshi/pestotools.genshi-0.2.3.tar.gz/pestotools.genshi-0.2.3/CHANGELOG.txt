CHANGELOG

Version 0.2.3

* Bugfix for docstring_as_string using TextTemplate

* Minor change to formfilled decorator, which now calculates form default
  values after the wrapped function has returned.

Version 0.2.2

* Added GenshiRender.docstring_as_string

* Added support for Genshi filters to be passed in to render methods
  via the ``filter`` argument

Version 0.2.1

* Rewrote genshi_app function as a class for more flexibility

Version 0.2

* No longer export render/render_docstring functions that can be configured
  with global variables. Instead clients should create instances of GenshiRender
  to access properly configured decorators.

* The @genshi decorator is now redundant and has been removed.

Version 0.1.1

* Values returned from decorated functions that can't be rendered are passed
  through unchanged wherever possible.
