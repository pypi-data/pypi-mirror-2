2009-10-03
~~~~~~~~~~

* Using a plain ``__import__()`` now without trying to deduce why any
  ``ImportError`` occurs

0.2.1
-----

2009-08-25
~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed the relative import to use ``__import__()`` instead of imp where
  a bug (or my misunderstanding) was causing modules which couldn't be 
  imported to get the namespace of other modules with the same name
  causing havoc!
* Added the ability to import the root package.

~~~~~~~~~~

0.2
---

2009-07-17
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a set of import tools for relative and absolute imports at runtime
  even within scripts and with versions of Python prior to 2.5.
* Added missing ``posixpath`` import.
* Changed ``AttributeDict`` to raise an ``AttributeError`` when setting a
  non-existent key instead of a ``NotImplementedError``.

2009-06-13
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added ``uniform_path()`` function
* Added begining of code for import related functions, including relative 
  imports within scripts (Python 2.5 only supports relative imports within
  packages)
* Added ``relpath()``, a function to calculate the relative path between two
  locations (only works on POSIX systems and already exists in Python 2.6)

0.1.0
-----

~~~~~~~~~~
