purity-ng
----

purity-ng is a reimplementation of the classic "purity" game in Python. 

The goal is maintaining compatibility with the old dataformat, and to
eventually be a drop-in replacement for purity. 

installing
----

 $ python setup.py install

Then run it:

 $ purity-ng list
 $ purity-ng hacker

You'll need tests for purity-ng to be useful. These can be found in the
"purity" package in Debian. Additional (possibly offensive) tests can be found
in the "purity-off" package.
