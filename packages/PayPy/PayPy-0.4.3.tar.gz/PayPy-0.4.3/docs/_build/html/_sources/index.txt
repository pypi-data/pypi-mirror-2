Introduction
------------

PayPy is a multi-gateway integrated payment processing package. There
are two general components to the library: transaction processing and
recurring transaction processing. The latter integrates with the
recurring billing offerings of the payment gateways and does not
handle the actual recurring charges.

As of this writing, Authorize.net is the only supported gateway - the
AIM (Advanced Integration Method) and ARB (Automated Recurring
Billing) API's.
