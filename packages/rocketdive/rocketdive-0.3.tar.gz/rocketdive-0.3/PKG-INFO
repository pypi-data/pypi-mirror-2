Description: Rocketdive is a non-programmer-friendly GUI frontend for Rocket which is
        a modern, multi-threaded, comet-friendly WSGI web server. So, of course, it
        depends on Rocket. Its GUI is written by Tkinter. Tested on Mac OS X, Linux
        and Windows.
        
        You can download executable binaries for Mac OS X (.dmg packaged .app) and

        (The name is borrowed from Japanese artist hide's song of the same title, but
        there is no relation between both.)
