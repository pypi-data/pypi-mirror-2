Introduction
============
The solely intention of this product is to replace the default "Transform" tab in Image content types with an icon-toolbar viewlet in the plone.belowcontent viewlet manager.

By keeping the user in the same page and requiring less clicks and page loads we intend to ease applying transformations in the images.

Features
========

- Degrades gracefully in non-JavaScript browsers
- i18n support by using atcontentypes and plone i18n domains.
- Tested in Plone 3.3.5 and Plone 4.0b3
