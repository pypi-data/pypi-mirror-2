------------------

- Bugfix: Allow to switch the sort order on the header link. This was

  item the other item get selected too.

- Implemented GetAttrFormatterColumn. This column can be used for simple
  value formatting columns.

  class="" for CSS classes. Thanks to Dan for reporting this bugs.

- Fix CheckBoxColumn, use always the correct selectedItems. Use always real
  selectedItems form the table
