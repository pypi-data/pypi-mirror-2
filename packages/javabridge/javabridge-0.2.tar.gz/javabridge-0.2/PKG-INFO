Description: This is a python wrapper for the Java Native Interface.  It was
        written as part of the CellProfiler project (http://cellprofiler.org)
        by members of the Imaging Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and
        Harvard.
        
        This code should be considered pre-Alpha quality.  It has been in use
        in the CellProfiler project, but may take some time to stabilize as a
        standalone library.
        
        Cython is used to compile and link the JNI.
