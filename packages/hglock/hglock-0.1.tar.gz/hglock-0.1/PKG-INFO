        While Mercurial is all about being decentralized, it is sometimes very
        useful to work in a centralized fashion: if the files you work on
        cannot be merged (binary files such as Word documents, Photoshop
        images, etc) then it is better to communicate upfront about any edits
        to avoid concurrent work.
