While Mercurial is all about being decentralized, it is sometimes very
useful to work in a centralized fashion: if the files you work on
cannot be merged (binary files such as Word documents, Photoshop
images, etc) then it is better to communicate upfront about any edits
to avoid concurrent work.


Version History
---------------

0.2
"""

Re-release of version 0.1. The change from a changegroup hook to a
pretxnchangegroup hook in 575c95b4ab8f had bad consequences. So
575c95b4ab8f and the followup fixes (d87f0dc0919e, 4ba9b24da91b,
7ec8374652ad) were too unstable to release.

This release builds on 4b61dc057391 and includes only the fix for lock
identifying the wrong file in a merge (7e3a4247e682 and 019d137a6ece)
along with the packaging changes.

0.1
"""

First tagged release.
