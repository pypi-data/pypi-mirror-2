        Introduction
        ==============================
        
        
        * minitage is a meta-package manager. It's a package manager which install packages with the help of other build systems.
        
        * Its goal is to help you to deploy projects in a standardised layout and to build things quickly and in a simple manner by putting in environment all configurations.
        
        * The main documentation is not there but on http://www.minitage.org, please go there for further instructions.
        
        
        
        =============================
        QuickStart with minitage
        =============================
        
        The whole doc is not there
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        but on http://www.minitage.org
        
        
        Check your Python
        +++++++++++++++++++++
        You need a python with setuptools, zlib, bz2 and ssl support.
        
        Try that in your interpretery::
        
            >>> import tarfile
            >>> import zipfile
            >>> import bz2
            >>> import _ssl
            >>> import zlib
            >>> import setuptools
            >>>
        
        If you do not have that, you can give a try to my pyboostrapper that bootstrap
        a python somewhere::
        
            wget http://git.minitage.org/git/minitage/shell/plain/PyBootstrapper.sh
            chmod +x PyBootstrapper.sh
            bash ./PyBootstrapper.sh /path/to/pythonPrefix
        
        Using virtualenv
        +++++++++++++++++++
        You 'd better to use `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ ,
        minitage fits well with it.
        
        virtualenv is a tool that allow you to create isolated Python
        environments.
        
        
            Here is how to set up an environment with it:
        
            - Install virtualenv::
        
                easy_install virtualenv #(maybe use sudo ;))
        
            - Install minitage prefix::
        
                virtualenv --no-site-packages  ~/minitage
        
            - activate it::
        
                source ~/minitage/bin/activate
        
        
            KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU MUST ACTIVATE VIRTUALENV AT ANY TIME YOU USE IT.
        
        minitage installation
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        The whole doc is not there but on http://www.minitage.org/installation.html.
        
        Minitage is a classical python egg, you can get it throught easy_install.
        
        To install minitage in a stable version, follow those steps:
        
        - Install minitage::
        
            easy_install -U mercurial minitage.core
        
        - Sync its packages (all its minilays in minitage terminology).::
        
            minimerge -s
        
        
        Syncing packages
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
            To sync all your minilays
        
                If you need to, fire your virtualenv::
        
                    source ~/minitage/bin/activate
        
                Sync::
        
                    minimerge -s
