Introduction
============

This library packages `JSON`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`JSON`: http://www.json.org/js.html

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.json``) are published to some URL.
