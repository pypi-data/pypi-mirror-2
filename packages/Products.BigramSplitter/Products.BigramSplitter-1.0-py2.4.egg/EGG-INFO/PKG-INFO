Description: Introduction
        ------------------------------
        
        Specification:
        Text character normalization process uses Python unicodedata.
        Convert full-width numeric and alphabet character into half-width equivalent.
        Convert half-width Katakana into full-width equivalent.
        Therefore all of above character variations can be recognized as same ones.
        
        Language Specifications:
        
        - Chinese
        
        - No space between words.
        - There is only Kanji(Chinese) character
        - Process	with Bigram(2-gram) model
        
        - Japanese
        
        - No space between words
        - Combination 0f Kanji(Chinese), Katakana, and Hiragana character
        
        - Korean
        
        - There are spaces between words, but it contains a particle
        - Combination of Korean alphabet and Kanji(Chinese) character
        - Discriminate Korean alphabet and Kanji(Chinese) character and processed with Bigram(2-gram) model
        
        - Thai
        
        - No space between words
        - It's very difficult to handle this language in a computer
        - A vowel and a consonant are registered in Unicode separately so that it is difficult to recognize as one word.
        - However, there is a possibility of dealing with Thai characters to use Bigram(2-gram) model.
        
        - Other languages (Including English)
        
        - There is a space between words
        
        - It is indexed each word
        
        Notes:
        
        - Source Code
        
        Since no documents are available on how to develop 'word splitter', we refer to other splitter source code. But I still have a number of questions. If you have any more information, please feel free let us know.
        
        - Hotfix to Plone 3.0 source code
        
        Because Plone 3.x catalog setting, catalog.xml, doesn't have existing index overwrite mechanism, we developed hotfix and added XML attribute. We believe Plone 3 XML define mechanism is simple and clear, so that we take this approach. We appreciate any comment.
