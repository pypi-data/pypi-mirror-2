        Changes
        =======
        
        0.5.1
        -----
        
        Upgrades to support the latest CommandTool 0.5.2. In particular:
        
        * Ability to order commands by specifying them as a list of 
          tuples or by using a ``bn.OrderedDict``
        * New ``run()`` method instead of the old ``on_run()``
        * Commands now get their own flow and can access pipes
        * Chained commands can access the states of the commands that executed
          before them in the chain
        * Commands are now marble-like
