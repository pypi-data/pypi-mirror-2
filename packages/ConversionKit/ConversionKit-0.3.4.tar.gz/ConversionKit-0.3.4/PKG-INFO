        Summary
        =======
        
        * A general purpose conversion library
        
        ConversionKit is a general purpose conversion library designed as an
        improvement to the functionality in FormEncode but using simple functions
        rather than complex schema and validators and avoiding the use of exceptions to
        flag errors. See the introducion in the manual for full details.

        =======
        
        0.3.4
        -----
        
        2011-07-06
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Releasing some changes from hg, including use of ``toDict()``
        
        0.3.3
        -----
        
        No changes.
        
        0.3.2
        -----
        
        2010-03-02
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Fixing a bug with ``Field()`` where empty_error settings weren't being 
          applied
        * Fixing a bug with incorrect message arguments
        * Added the start of a types library
        
        2009-12-24
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * BuildKit support
        
        0.3.1
        -----
        
        2009-09-30
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added extra message options to ``toDictionary()``
        * Updated the ``MANIFEST.in`` file to include the tests and doc sources
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        2009-09-29
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Updated the license to GNU AGPLv3
        * Split the FormEncode documentation and tests out from the main docs and 
          tests. FormEncode isn't officially supported and its use with ConversionKit
          is deprecated.
        
        2009-08-18
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Renamed ``new_conversion`` to ``child_conversion`` internally
        * Upgraded ``tryEach()`` to be able to assign items to a dictionary, and stop
          on the first result or first error.
        * Made ``toDictionary()`` return unicode keys by default
        * Used ``pprint()`` in the docs to help avoid the problem of dictionaries
          changing their sort order as functionality changes and help make the code
          easier to read.
        
        2009-08-11
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Allowed missing and empty errors in ``toDictionary()`` to be specified as a
          string and as a tuple as well as a dict and added in documentation and tests.
        
        2009-08-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Improved the documentation and checked doctests all pass
        * Refactored the ``toDictionary()`` converter to support missing and 
          empty errors and defaults
        * Removed the ``nested``, ``first_stab`` and ``second_stab`` modules
        
        2009-07-31
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Clarified process around post converters
        * Changed naming convention to use a lower-case first letter for functions 
          which return functions
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        2009-03-31
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added Or converter
        
        2009-03-23
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Re-written from the ground up with a better naming convention and more 
          explanation in the docs.
        * Implemented if_missing and if_empty.
        
        0.1.0
        -----
        
        2009-02-24
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Completely re-wrote everything again with a vastly simplified API, new 
          detailed documentation, over 180 doctests and Sphinx doc generation.
        
        2009-02-21
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added new handlers
        * Errors now return a string
        * QUERNS format error encoding supported
        * Added some more examples to the docs
        
        2009-02-19
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Complete re-write to use a convesion-oriented approach, remove groups and
          focus on nested structs as the preferred data structure. The original code
          is still available in first_stab.py
        
        0.0
        ---
        
        * Added some better error handling
        * First version
