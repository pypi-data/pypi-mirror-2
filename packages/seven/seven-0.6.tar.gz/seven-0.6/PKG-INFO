Description: ``seven`` is a ``Python 2.6+`` compatibility layer for ``Python 2.5``. It
        allows you to import ``Python 2.6`` or ``2.7`` code in a ``2.5`` interpreter.
        It is mainly intended to be used on ``Google App Engine``.
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        Before importing non-compatible code, you need to start the ``seven`` import
        hook by calling ``seven.start()``::
        
            >>> import seven
            >>> seven.start()
        
            >>> import incompatible.modules
        
            >>> seven.stop()  # optional
        
        The above will install an import hook and preprocess all modules before
        importing them using ``lib2to3`` from the ``Python 2.7`` ``stdlib``. The
        installed hook will process all imported python modules until you call
        ``seven.stop()``. If you don't stop it, all imports will be processed.
        
        
        Import whitelists
        -----------------
        
        Preprocessing all imported modules might not always be a good idea, mainly for
        two reasons. Firs, it comes with a slight performance penalty. Second, more
        important reason is that exceptions raised in modules that have been processed
        by the import hook can be really hard to debug. Line numbers are usually wrong,
        and the filename is not displayed correctly. These things might be improved in
        the future, but for now it is advised that only the necessary modules be
        processed.
        
        The following example will only preprocess the modules ``foo``, ``spam.eggs``
        and their submodules, ``foo.*`` and ``spam.eggs.*``::
        
            >>> seven.start(['foo', 'spam.eggs'])
        
        
        What gets fixed?
        ----------------
        
        
        Of course, not all fixers have been implemented yet. The following features are
        available (without using ``from __future__`` imports):
        
        * ``with`` statement (``from __future__ import with_statement``)
        * absolute imports (``from __future__ import absolute_imports``)
        * integer division (``from __future__ import division``)
        * class decorators
        
        Class decorators are converted like this::
        
            @decorated
            class C:
                pass
        
        becomes::
        
            class C:
                pass
            C = decorated(C)
        
        
        How to disable logging and pickling?
        ------------------------------------
        
        On certain production environments, logging might not be very useful, or
        writing files might not be possible (e.g. App Engine). To disable logging or
        writing pickle dumps, create a module named ``sevenconfig`` and add the ``log =
        False`` or ``speedups = False`` globals (or both). Make sure the module is
        importable before importing ``seven``.
        
        
        What needs to be implemented?
        -----------------------------
        
        The following features do not have fixers yet:
        
        * indented ``class`` decorators
        * ``except Exception as e:``
        * advanced string formatting
        * ``print`` as a function
        * ``set`` literals
        * ``dict`` and ``set`` comprehensions
        * multiple context managers in one ``with`` statement
        * etc.
        
        
        How to write fixers?
        --------------------
        
        By subclassing ``seven.lib2to3.fixer_base.BaseFix``. You can also fork this
        project on GitHub_, have a look at the existing fixers in ``src/seven/fixes``
        and add your own, thend send me a pull request.
