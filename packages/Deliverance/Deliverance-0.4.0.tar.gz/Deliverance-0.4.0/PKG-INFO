Description: Deliverance does transformations of HTML to 'theme' pages, similar in
        function to XSLT but using a simpler XML-based language to express the
        transformation.
        
        New in this release:
        
        
        * Added a response-status matcher, for matching against the status code of the response.
        Use like <match response-status="404" class="notfounds" /> (esanchez)
        
        * Added a ReverseMatcher, which allows you to prefix a match statement with not: to reverse
        the result.  Use like <match path="not:/bad-path" /> (esanchez)
        
        * Added a boolean collapse-sources attribute on TransformActions
        (append, prepend, replace) which can signal that elements moved
        from the content to the theme should be "fully collapsed" into the
        theme immediately, allowing subsequent actions to act on those
        elements within the theme.
        
        * Added support for mounting WSGI applications directly in the proxy,
        as an alternative to HTTP proxy endpoints.
        
        * Fixed error when trying to move or copy HTML comment nodes (#69)
        
        * Fixed error in deliverance-proxy when proxying HEAD requests (#66)
        
        * Factored out method ``DeliveranceMiddleware.default_theme(self, environ)``
        so that subclasses can implement custom logic for calculating the global
        default theme per request based on the WSGI environment and the value of
        ``self._default_theme`` which is set by the ``theme_uri`` parameter in
        the paste.deploy configuration.
        
        The default implementation returns the raw string ``self._default_theme``
        directly.
        
        * Factored out method ``DeliveranceMiddleware.build_external_subrequest``
        which is called when Deliverance is getting a resource via an external
        subrequest (as opposed to a file:// URL or an internal subrequest to the
        application being wrapped by Deliverance)
        
        The method returns a webob.Request object; the default implementation
        returns a blank Request with only the header
        ``x-deliverance-theme-subrequest`` set.  Subclasses can override
        this behavior, e.g. to preserve certain headers from the original
        request into subrequests.
        
        * Moved tests from test_middleware.txt to test_middleware.py, and converted
        to WebTest, to improve clarity of tests and ease of adding new tests.
