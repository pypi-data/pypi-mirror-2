Developer Debugging Console
===========================

You must be logged in to view the developer console.  The login page
is available at ``/.deliverance/login`` -- you define the users using
the `server-settings <configuration.html#server-settings>`_ configuration. 

After you log in you can add ``?deliv_log`` to any page URL to get a
log at the bottom of the page.  The log describes in detail how the
page was transformed, including information about how the proxy was
chosen and any subrequests.  It also lets you browse the source
involved, see what the selectors select in the content or theme, or
get a list of interesting ids and classes in the content.
