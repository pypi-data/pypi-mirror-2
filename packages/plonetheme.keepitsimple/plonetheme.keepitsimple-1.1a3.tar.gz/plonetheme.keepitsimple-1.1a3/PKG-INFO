        1. Overview
        -----------
        
        "Keep it simple" is a fluid 3-column theme, minimalistic and light colored
        design. The original web template comes from http://www.styleshout.com.
        
        The implementation permited different font sizes whit a great degree of
        adaptation.
        
        
        2. Authors & Contributors
        -------------------------
        
        * Silvestre Marcelo Huens (Quimera)(www.menttes.com)
          Ported template to Plone 3.x.
        * Gonzalo Almeida (flecox)(www.menttes.com)
          Migrated the template to Plone 4.0
        * http://www.styleshout.com
          Created the original web template.
        
        
        3. Dependencies
        ---------------
        
        The following are required to use this theme:
        
        * Zope
        * Plone 3.x
        * SetupTools
        
        
        4. Installation
        ---------------
        
        Assuming that you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, proceed this way:
        
        * Add plonetheme.keepitsimple to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
          [buildout]
           ...
           eggs =
               ...
               plonetheme.keepitsimple
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        ::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        Then you can install the product into your Plone site from the Plone control
        panel.
        
        In Plone 4, if you uninstall plonetheme.keepitsimple you will notice that the
        site will start looking very raw in style. This is because 'Plone Default' is
        set as default skin after uninstallation. To change the default skin you need
        to go to the Themes tool in the control panel and select a default skin
        different from 'Plone Default'.
        
        
        5. Customization
        ----------------
        
        This theme have a banner with image and text, there you can customize:
        
        * Logo: place a logo.jpg file in the folder skins/plonetheme_keepitsimple_custom_images
        * Text: edit the template intro_text.pt in the folder browser/templates
        
        Customization done by this product:
        
        * The main_template was customized for change the order of the columns.
        * A viewlet manager and viewlet was added in the header to manage the logo and
          text banner.
        * The search box in the top was customized (no more "current folder only" check
          box)
        
        
        6. Support
