4. Installation
---------------

Assuming that you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, proceed this way:

* Add plonetheme.keepitsimple to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

::

  [buildout]
   ...
   eggs =
       ...
       plonetheme.keepitsimple

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

::

  $ ./bin/buildout


Then you can install the product into your Plone site from the Plone control
panel.

In Plone 4, if you uninstall plonetheme.keepitsimple you will notice that the
site will start looking very raw in style. This is because 'Plone Default' is
set as default skin after uninstallation. To change the default skin you need
to go to the Themes tool in the control panel and select a default skin
different from 'Plone Default'.
