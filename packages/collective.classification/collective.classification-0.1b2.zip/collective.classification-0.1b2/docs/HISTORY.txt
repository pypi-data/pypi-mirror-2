Changelog
=========

0.1b2
-------------------

- Removed the persistent noun storage altogether. Now noun and noun-phrase
  terms are stored directly in the catalog using plone.indexer.
  [ggozad, stefan]
- Using BTrees instead of PersistenDict. Should make writes to ZODB lighter.
  [ggozad]
- Noun-phrase grammar and normalization is now a property of the
  language-dependent tagger.
  [ggozad]
- Removed a lot of the control panel functionality. Not need for confusion.
  [ggozad]
- Fixed Dutch language support.
  [ggozad]

0.1b1
-------------------

- Speed gain by not utilizing the PenTreeBank tagger anymore. [ggozad]
- Added multi-lingual support, starting with dutch! [ggozad]
- No need to download all the coprora anymore. [ggozad]
- A lot of refactoring. Things got moved around and a lot of unnecessary code
  was removed. [ggozad]
- We now use a Brill/Trigram/Affix tagger that is pre-trained. This
  allows collective.classification to ship without all the corpora. The user
  can still supply a different tagger if necessary. [ggozad]
- The default nltk PenTreeBank tagger is no longer used. Too slow. [ggozad]
- npextractor is no longer a local persistent utility. Opted for a global
  non-persisted object. [ggozad]
- zope.lifecycle events are now used. [ggozad]
- Gained compatibility with plone 4. [ggozad]

0.1a3
-------------------

- Introduced IClassifiable interface. ATContentTypes are now adapted to it,
  and it should be easier to add other non-AT content types or customize the
  adapter. [ggozad]
- Handling of IObjectRemovedEvent event. [ggozad]
- Added a form to import sample content from the brown corpus, for debugging
  and testing. [ggozad]
- Added some statistics information with @@classification-stats.
  Displays the number of parsed documents, as well as the most useful terms.
  [ggozad]
- Added @@terms view, allowing a user to inspect the identified terms for some
  content. [ggozad]
- Have to specify corpus categories when training n-gram tagger. Fixes #3
  [ggozad]
