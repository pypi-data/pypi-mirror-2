Introduction
============

unweb.shareit is a plone product that adds a "share this" link or button that shows a jquery popup with links to various social sites. The popup is based on the jquery shareit plugin: http://joanpiedra.com/jquery/shareit/

unweb.shareit aims to be as unobtrusive as possible. It uses GenericSetup actions to register the icon in the document actions, and avoids overriding any plone templates.
