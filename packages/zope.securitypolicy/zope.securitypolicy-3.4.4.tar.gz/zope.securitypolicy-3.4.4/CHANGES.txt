3.4.4 (2010-04-29)
------------------

- LP #564525: Revert the name used for the view permission exported by
  ``zope.dublincore`` to one which matches the names in released versions
  of that package (3.6.0 and earlier).

3.4.3 (2010-04-16)
------------------

- LP #564525:  fix permission moved from ``zope.app.dublincore`` namespace
  to ``zope.dublincore``, and make its grant conditional on the presence of
  ``zope.dublincore``.

3.4.2 (2009-01-28)
------------------

- Changed mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org. Fix package
  homepage to the pypi page.

- Fix test in buildout which still depended on zope.app.securitypolicy
  by mistake.

- Remove explicit dependency on zope.app.form from ``setup.py``; nothing
  in the code directly depends on this.

------------------

- Fix reference to deprecated security policy from ZCML.

3.4.0 (2007-09-25)
