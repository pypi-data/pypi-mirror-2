        ==========
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        LinguaPlus provides several amenities designed to improve the LinguaPlone
        workflow. By automatically applying 'mark outdated' (from slc.outdated)
        to translations when the canonical version is changed,  translators can
        keep track of which translated items need to be updated. Side-by-side
        editing for plone.app.iterate working copies allows the translator
        to reference the canonical version while making changes in a working
        copy. When the content has been updated an administrator can check it
        back in and remove the outdated flag.
        
        Provide content rule triggers for `plone.app.iterate`.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This package allows you to trigger content rules based on
        plone.app.iterate's four events: "An object will been checked
        out" (IBeforeCheckoutEvent), "An object has been checked out"
        (ICheckoutEvent), "A working copy will be checked in" (ICheckinEvent),
        "A working copy has been checked in" (IAfterCheckinEvent).
        
        Mark translations as outdated when the canonical version is changed.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This package provides a content action that can be used to mark all
        translations as outdated when the canonical version is edited, using
        `slc.outdated` to provide the underlying 'mark as outdated' feature.
        
        Most sites are probably edited both directly and by checkout/checkin
        depending on the privileges of the author. To detect both kinds of edits,
        you will need two content rules. One for 'A working copy has been checked
        in' and another for 'Object Modified (but only if the object is not
        a folder)'.
        
        Once these rules are set up, per-language collections of outdated content
        can serve as a to-do list for translators. Once the content has been
        updated, manually 'toggle outdated' on the newly retranslated content.
        
        Edit working copies side-by-side with the canonical version.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This package provides a 'side-by-side' view to edit plone.app.iterate
        working copies alongside the baseline's canonical revision, just like
        LinguaPlone's edit view but for working copies. In a working copy, just
        use the 'side by side' tab instead of the 'edit' tab to reference the
        canonical version.
