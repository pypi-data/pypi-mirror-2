dumb is a suite of tools to manage collections of bookmarks that are:

* indipendent from the browser / application:
   dumb bookmarks can point to anything that has an URL, regardless 
   of the app needed to open them.
* shareable and distributed:
   dumb bookmarks are designed to be easily managed in a DVCS to provide 
   an easy mean to share a bookmark collection within a team, a community 
   or the whole world.
