mappingsql is TiddlyWeb StorageInterface implementation
that maps an RDBMS table as a bag, with each row representing
a tiddler.

It has many limitations (on purpose):

* It is READ ONLY
* It only supports one bag.
* It has no support for recipes.
* It has no support revisions.
* It has limited support for search.

You tell tiddlywebconfig.py what database you want to look
at, what table you want to map, and what bag name you want
that table to think of itself as. The column name 'id'
is mapped to tiddler.title unless overridden by the
configuration setting of 'mappingsql.id_column'. Any column
names that map to Tiddler attributes are applied. Otherwise,
columns are mapped into tiddler.fields.

Search support is used primarily with MySQL and its full text
indexing system. You may turn on this support with 
'mappingsql.full_text' set to True.

This is experimental alpha software, reading and understanding
the code is recommending before using. There is additional information
in the module docstring.

TODO:

* Make mapping of columns to tiddler attributes optional.
* Cast column data to unicode with flair.
