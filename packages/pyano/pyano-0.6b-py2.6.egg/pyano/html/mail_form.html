    <p>
      Use this mixmaster web interface to send anonymous emails. If no remailers are selected in the chain, then mixmaster will automatically select a remailer chain for you. If you intend on using the <em>From</em> field please read the instructions <a href="#from">here</a>. For more detailed instructions, refer to the <a href="#help">help</a> section below.

    <h2><a name="help">Help</a></h2>

    
    <h3><a name="from">From</a></h3>
    <p>
      Not all remailers support "from" lines. If you wish to use a custom from line rather than one the remailer chooses for you, you must select a remailer that supports custom from lines as the last remailer in the chain! Put your from line in this format: <kbd>"John Smith" &lt;john@domain.com&gt;</kbd>
    </p>

    <h3>Chain &amp; copies</h3>

    <p>
      Mixmaster wraps your message in layers of PGP encryption. Each remailer in the chain unwraps one layer and then sends the rest to the next remailer. In this way no one remailer knows the source, destination, and contents. The longer the chain you use, the more guaranteed the anonymity. However, this comes at the cost of reliabilty. Indeed, remailers can be unreliable and there is no guarantee that every message sent will arrive at it's destination. Increasing the number of copies increases the reliability.

    <p>
      The remailers are listed in the drop lists with some stats. Those stats are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="description">
      <li><dfn>Name</dfn>: The name of the remailer.</li>
      <li><dfn>Latency</dfn>: Latency means how long the remailer will hold onto the message before delivering it to the next remailer in line.</li>
      <li><dfn>Uptime</dfn>: This is a percentage. Obviously you want to use remailers with high uptime. I would choose 95% or better.</li>
      <li><dfn>M (middle)</dfn>: If you see this letter next to a remailer it means that this remailer only operates in <em>middleman</em> mode. That means you can only use it in the middle of a chain. If you use it at the end, your message will not be delivered.</li>
      <li><dfn>F (from) </dfn>: This remailer may allow user-supplied from headers. See above for more information.</li>
      <li><dfn>(breaks: list)</dfn>: This remailer has known problems when using any other remailer in this list as a next hop.</li>
    </ul>
