# Sample configuration file for pymix
[Pyano]

# Path to the mixmaster binary
# 
# Pyano assumes that mixmaster is installed on the system
# and that the user running the web-server can use it.
# Make sure this works before trying to run the web interface.
# For example, try:
#   su www-data; mixmaster
#
# Default: /usr/bin/mixmaster
#
#mixmaster: /usr/bin/mixmaster


# Default list of mail2news gateways
#
# A comma-separated list of mail2news gateways to use in the
# usenet web interface to override the configuration of the
# final remailer in the chain.
#
# Default: mail2news@dizum.com, mail2news@bananasplit.info, mail2news@m2n.mixmin.net, mail2news@reece.net.au
#
#mail2news: mail2news@dizum.com, mail2news@m2n.mixmin.net

# Path to the mlist2.txt file
#
# This file contains reliability statistics on known remailers.
# Without it, the interface will not display any statistics or 
# allow you to choose your remailer chain, and simply rely
# on mixmaster to make all the decisions.
#
# This file is provided either by a pinger (e.g. echolot)
# or located in the 'stats' directory of the mixmaster user's home
# after running 'mixmaster --update-stats'.
#
# The webserver needs READ access to this file. 
#
# Default: ''
#
#mlist2: /home/echolot/results/mlist2.txt


# Path to the from.html file
#
# This file contains information on which remailers
# allow User-supplied 'From' headers. Without it, the interface
# will display no information on whether or not a given 
# pinger lets though custon 'From' headers.
#
# This file is provided by the echolot pinger. If you don't run
# a pinger yourself, you can run a cron script to regularily 
# download it from a pinger's website.
# 
# The webserver needs READ access to this file. 
#
# Default: ''
#
#allow_from: /home/echolot/results/from.html


# Security
#
# In order to prevent spamming, Pyano keeps timestamps
# of the past uses of the web interface per ip in the 'hist_file'
# file.
#
# Pyano uses a sliding window of 'hist_window' minutes. 
# During this period, a given ip may not send more than 'hist_max_uses'
# messages during this time frame. If the same ip continues to
# try to send messages despite being blocked, it will be permanently
# banned after 2*'hist_max_uses' attempts. These ips are stored in
# the 'banned_file' file.
#
# The webserver needs WRITE access to both the 'hist_file' and
# 'banned_file'. 
#
# WARNING: if these option is not defined, there will be no
# limit on the frequency with which people may use the 
# interface.
# 
# Defaults:
#   hist_file: ''
#   banned_file: ''
#   hist_window: 15
#   hist_max_uses: 5
#
#hist_file: /tmp/hist_file
#banned: /tmp/banned_file
#hist_window: 15
#hist_max_uses: 5


# Maximum Chain Length
#
# This sets the maximum number of remailers that may
# be chosen in the web interface.
#
# Default: 5
#
#max_chain_length: 5


# Maximum number of copies
#
# This sets the maximum number of redundant copies that may
# be chosen in the web interface to increase reliability.
#
# Default: 5
#
#max_copies: 5
