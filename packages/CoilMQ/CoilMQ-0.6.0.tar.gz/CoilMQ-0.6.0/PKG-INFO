Description: 
        The provided server implementation for CoilMQ uses the Python SocketServer 
        libraries; however, CoilMQ is only loosely coupled to this server 
        implementation.  It could be used with other socket implementations.
        
        The CoilMQ core classes and bundled storage implementations are built to be
        thread-safe.
        
        Changes in 0.6.0
        ----------------
        * Added a new diagnostic thread that will run when --debug option
          is passed on the commandline.
        * Added method to QueueManager API  to support tracking subscriber count. 
        * Improved unit and functional test coverage of storage engines.
        * Fixed bug in engine.commit() and updated tests to catch previous 
          failure (issue 28).
