Description: 
        CoilMQ is a STOMP message broker written in Python.
        
        The provided server implementation for CoilMQ uses the Python SocketServer libraries;
        however, CoilMQ is only loosely coupled to this server implementation.  It could be used
        with other socket implementations.
        
        Two things worth noting:
        
          1. The CoilMQ core classes and bundled storage implementations are designed to be thread-safe.
        
          2. While this project could be used with asynchronous frameworks like Twisted, it is not 
             explicitly designed to use the async patterns (e.g. using Twisted Deffered), which may 
             make it impractical to use this with slow/blocking storage mechanisms (e.g. using db 
             storage will cause all clients to block).
