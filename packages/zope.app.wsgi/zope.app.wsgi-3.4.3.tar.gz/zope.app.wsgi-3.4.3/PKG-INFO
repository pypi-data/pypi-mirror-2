Description: This package provides the ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` class which
        exposes the object publishing machinery in ``zope.publisher`` as a
        WSGI application.  It also lets us bring up the Zope application
        server (parsing ``zope.conf`` and ``site.zcml``) with a mere function
        call::
        
        >>> db = zope.app.wsgi.config('zope.conf')
        
        This is especially useful for debugging.
        
        To bring up Zope and obtain the WSGI application object at the same
        time, use the ``getWSGIApplication`` function.  Here's an example of a
        factory a la PasteDeploy_::
        
        def application_factory(global_conf):
        zope_conf = os.path.join(global_conf['here'], 'zope.conf')
        return zope.app.wsgi.getWSGIApplication(zope_conf)
        
        .. _PasteDeploy: http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/
