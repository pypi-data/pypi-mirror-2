Clio
****

Clio is a library based on SQLAlchemy that can be used to add a
publication workflow and archiving system to a database.

The documentation is available at http://packages.python.org/clio/

Note that currently MySQL is a requirement (for running the tests, and
for the sequence support). This requirement is not a core requirement
of Clio however, and the main Clio codebase does not depend on it, so
it is expected to go away.
