CHANGES
*******

0.7 (2010-05-14)
================

- Changed the database schema: two new fields were added
  (``changed_timestamp`` and ``created_userid``).  Throw away the
  ``clio_tests`` database and recreate it again to run the tests. You
  will have to upgrade your existing databases as well.
 
- When a new version is created of an existing object, the
  ``changed_userid`` will be copied over from the last version. If a
  new object is created from scratch, it will be the
  ``created_userid``. ``changed_timestamp`` is treated the same. This
  makes it possible to detect changes between versions by comparing
  the timestamps.

- Update documentation to include integer status codes as they appear
  in the database.

- Updated documentation to include changed information about the
  timestamps were recorded (as of 0.6), as well as the new timestamp.

0.6.4 (2010-02-17)
==================

- Provide an 'update' method for Sequence, so we can set the sequence
  value. This can be useful in code that converts old databases that
  already define the equivalent of 'code'.

0.6.3 (2010-02-12)
==================

- Another bugfix with revert logic. Allow reverting already published
  objects, as they may have relations that need to be reverted. Don't
  raise an error when trying to revert an archived object, instead
  just don't do anything.

0.6.2 (2010-02-12)
==================

- Fixed a bug in revert logic. Reversion of edited records should now
  work better when there are relations.

0.6.1 (2010-02-10)
==================

- Added ``_actual`` property which is like _editable, except that deleted
  items are not part of it.

- Also added is_actual method.

0.6 (2010-02-10)
================

- userid tracking for workflow events.

- change the way timestamps are recorded so that queries for older
  published items can more easily be constructed. This breaks existing
  databases. We assume nobody but the author is using Clio yet.

- stop using pysqlite in the tests; the tests now depend on MySQL.

- Introduce ACTUAL_STATUSES. This is what is present in the edit UI,
  except those things that were deleted. This can be handy in queries.

0.5 (2009-11-16)
================

- Initial public release.
