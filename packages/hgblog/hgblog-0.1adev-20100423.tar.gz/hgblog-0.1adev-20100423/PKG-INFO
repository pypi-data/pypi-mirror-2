Description: .. -*- restructuredtext -*-
        
        HgBlog is a set of modifications to the Sphinx project to make it slightly more
        suitable as a blogging engine.  It's built for those of us who love using
        reStructuredText markup to write documents.
        
        The quickstart wizard handles setting up an HgBlog for you.  This includes all
        of the usual things that the Sphinx quickstart utility does, but it creates a
        Mercurial repository and installs a hook and intelligent ignores for you.  The
        hook will automatically convert the ``.rst`` files that Mercurial is tracking
        into HTML using Sphinx when you commit changes to the repository.
        
        Additionally, when you pull changes in from a remote clone of the repository,
        the hook will do the conversion just like when you commit locally.  You can set
        the hook up on remote clones as well.  The hook *only* converts ``.rst`` files
        that are tracked by Mercurial.  This means you can work on new blog articles
        without committing them to the repository to have them not appear online.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        There are several ways to install HgBlog:
        
        * Using ``pip`` (recommended)::
        
        pip install -U hgblog
        
        * Using ``easy_install``::
        
        easy_install hgblog
        
        * From the CheeseShop
        
        * Download the ``.tar.gz`` file from `PyPI <http://2ze.us/m2M>`_
        * Extract the ``.tar.gz`` file
        * Run ``python setup.py install`` using the ``setup.py`` in the extracted directory
        
        * Using Mercurial::
        
        hg qclone http://bitbucket.org/codekoala/hgblog
        cd hgblog
        hg qapply -a
        python setup.py install
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        HgBlog leverages the existing quickstart wizard for Sphinx projects.  There
        are some modifications to reduce the number of steps required, so you should
        be able to be up and running within a minute using::
        
        hgblog-quickstart
        
        All you need to do is:
        
        * Provide the directory on your filesystem that shall be used for your blogging
        needs.
        * Provide a name for your blog
        * Provide your name
        * Select any extensions you may want to include in your blog
        
        Once you do that, you should have a few new directories, one of which will be
        called ``source``.  This is where you should write your ``.rst`` articles.  When
        you're done working on a particular article, you can use::
        
        hg add
        hg ci
        
        ...to add and commit it to your Mercurial repository.  At this point, Sphinx will
        be asked to generate the HTML for your blog based on your ``.rst`` files.
        
        TODOs
        =====
        
        * Implement Disqus commenting
        * Add RSS feeds
        * Include a simple, static HTML web server for faster results
