        PySideKick:  helpful utilities for working with PySide
        ======================================================
        
        
        This package is a rather ad-hoc collection of helpers, utilities and custom
        widgets for building applications with PySide.  So far we have:
        
          * PySideKick.Call:  helpers for calling functions in a variety of ways,
                              e.g. qCallAfter, qCallInMainThread
        
          * PySideKick.Console:   a simple interactive console to embed in your
                                  application
