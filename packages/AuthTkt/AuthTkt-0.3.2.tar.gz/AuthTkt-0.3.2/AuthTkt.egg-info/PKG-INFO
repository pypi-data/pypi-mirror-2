        This software was written from scratch, line by line by James Gardner. It is
        designed to replace the Perl modules and CGI scripts distributed with
        mod_auth_tkt.
        
        Just to save any complications this software is currently licensed under the
        same license as mod_auth_tkt which can be found below but if I have time I
        might investigate a more standard Open Source license instead.
