Portions (if not the entirety) Copyright (c) 2008 James Gardner

This software was written from scratch, line by line by James Gardner. It is
designed to replace the Perl modules and CGI scripts distributed with
mod_auth_tkt.

Just to save any complications this software is currently licensed under the
same license as mod_auth_tkt which can be found below but if I have time I
might investigate a more standard Open Source license instead.

It also uses an AuthTkt class which I think might have originally been
