PyTTY
=====

Installing
----------

Install this package using distutils:
# python setup.py build
# sudo python setup.py install

See the distutils documentation or help for more options.


Purpose
-------
I created PyTTY because PySerial/etc are not available for Python 3.  
While it would be good to get these older packages upgraded for newer 
Python releases, PyTTY is intended to be cleaner and use more of 
Python's standard library than older serial packages.


Help
----
Use pydoc for more information on using pytty.
