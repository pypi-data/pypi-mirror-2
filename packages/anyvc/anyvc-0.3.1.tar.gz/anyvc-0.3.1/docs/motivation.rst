Why was anyvc created?
======================

The idea for anyvc came along when there was need to
integrate various VCS's better in PIDA_.

Taking a look at other IDE's they had all separate Plugins 
for the different VCS, at different stages of
support, testability and various other issues.

So the idea of a Common, well tested api at the same stage of support formed.

One api to create checkouts/reps, and to interact with the workspaces and the history.
