.. currentmodule:: testfixtures

1.9.0 (11 February 2011)
------------------------

- Added :class:`~components.TestComponents` for getting a sterile
  registry when testing code that uses :mod:`zope.component`.

1.8.0 (14 January 2011)
-----------------------

- Added full Sphinx-based documentation.

- added a `Manuel <http://packages.python.org/manuel/>`__ plugin for
  reading and writing files into a :class:`TempDirectory`.

- any existing log handlers present when a :class:`LogCapture` is
  installed for a particular logger are now removed.

- fix the semantics of :class:`should_raise`, which should always
  expect an exception to be raised!

- added the :class:`ShouldRaise` context manager.

- added recursive support to :meth:`TempDirectory.listdir` and added
  the new :meth:`TempDirectory.check_all` method.

- added support for forward-slash separated paths to all relevant
  :class:`TempDirectory` methods.

- added :meth:`TempDirectory.getpath` method.

- allow files and directories to be ignored by a regular expression
  specification when using :class:`TempDirectory`.

- made :class:`Comparison` objects work when the attributes expected
  might be class attributes.

- re-implement :func:`test_time` so that it uses the correct way to
  get timezone-less time.

- added :meth:`~tdatetime.set` along with `delta` and `delta_type`
  parameters to :func:`test_date`, :func:`test_datetime` and
  :func:`test_time`.

- allow the date class returned by the :meth:`tdatetime.date` method
  to be configured.

- added the :class:`OutputCapture` context manager.

- added the :class:`StringComparison` class.

- added options to ignore trailing whitespace and blank lines when
  comparing multi-line strings with :func:`compare`.

- fixed bugs in the handling of some exception types when using
  :class:`Comparison`, :class:`ShouldRaise` or :class:`should_raise`.

- changed :func:`wrap` to correctly set __name__, along with some
  other attributes, which should help when using the decorators with
  certain testing frameworks.

1.7.0 (20 January 2010)
-----------------------

- fixed a bug where the @replace decorator passed a classmethod
  rather than the replacment to the decorated callable when replacing
  a classmethod

- added set method to test_date, test_datetime and test_time to allow
  setting the parameters for the next instance to be returned.

- added delta and delta_type parameters to test_date,test_datetime and
  test_time to control the intervals between returned instances.


1.6.2 (23 September 2009)
-------------------------

- changed Comparison to use __eq__ and __ne__ instead of the
  deprecated __cmp__

- documented that order matters when using Comparisons with objects
  that implement __eq__ themselves, such as instances of Django
  models.

1.6.1 (06 September 2009)
-------------------------

- @replace and Replacer.replace can now replace attributes that may
  not be present, provided the `strict` parameter is passed as False.

- should_raise now catches BaseException rather than Exception so
  raising of SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt can be tested.

1.6.0 (09 May 2009)
-------------------

- added support for using TempDirectory, Replacer and LogCapture as
  context managers.

- fixed test failure in Python 2.6.

1.5.4 (11 Feb 2009)
-------------------

- fix bug where should_raise didn't complain when no exception 
  was raised but one was expected.

- clarified that the return of a should_raise call will be None
  in the event that an exception is raised but no expected 
  exception is specified.

1.5.3 (17 Dec 2008)
-------------------

- should_raise now supports methods other than __call__

1.5.2 (14 Dec 2008)
-------------------

- added `makedir` and `check_dir` methods to TempDirectory and added
  support for sub directories to `read` and `write`

1.5.1 (12 Dec 2008)
-------------------

- added `path` parameter to `write` method of TempDirectory so
  that the full path of the file written can be easilly obtained

1.5.0 (12 Dec 2008)
-------------------

- added handy `read` and `write` methods to TempDirectory for
  creating and reading files in the temporary directory
