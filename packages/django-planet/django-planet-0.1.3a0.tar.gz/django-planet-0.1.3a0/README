django-planet
=============

This is a generic application for Django projects aiming to provide a planet
feed aggregator app.

Django-planet is heavily based on Feedjack's [1] models by Gustavo Picon and my
django app that extends it: feedjack-extension [2]. Changes and addings to
models were inspired by Mark Pilgrim's Feedparser [3].
