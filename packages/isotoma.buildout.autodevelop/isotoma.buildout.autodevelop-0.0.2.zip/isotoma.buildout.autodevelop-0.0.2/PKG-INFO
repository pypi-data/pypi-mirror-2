Description: Autodevelop buildout extension
        ==============================
        
        This package provides a buildout_ extension for automatically developing source eggs
        in the current project.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Logging your buildout run
        -------------------------
        
        You just need to add an extension to your buildout.cfg::
        
        [buildout]
        extensions = isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
        
        By default this will check every directory below where you execute buildout for
        setup.py. Buildout managed directories like develop-eggs-directory will be excluded.
        If you want to further restrict the search path, you can till the extension where
        to search::
        
        [buildout]
        extensions = isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
        autodevelop =
        src
        externals
        
        This will develop any source eggs contained in your src and externals directories.
        
        
        Optional Parameters
        -------------------
