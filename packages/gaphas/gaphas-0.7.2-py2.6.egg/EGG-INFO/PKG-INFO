Description: Gaphas is a MVC canvas that uses Cairo_ for rendering. One of the nicer things
        of this widget is that the user (model) is not bothered with bounding box
        calculations: this is all done through Cairo.
        
        Some more features:
        
        - Each item has it's own separate coordinate space (easy when items are
        rotated).
        - Items on the canvas can be connected to each other. Connections are
        maintained by a linear constraint solver.
        - Multiple views on one Canvas.
        - What is drawn is determined by Painters. Multiple painters can be used and
        painters can be chained.
        - User interaction is handled by Tools. Tools can be chained.
        - Versatile undo/redo system
        
        GTK+ and PyGTK_ are required.
