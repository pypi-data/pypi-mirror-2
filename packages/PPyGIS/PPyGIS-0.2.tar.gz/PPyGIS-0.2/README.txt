PPyGIS is an extension the Psycopg_, a PostgreSQL_ database adapter for the Python_ programming language. PPyGIS adds support for PostGIS_ geometry objects by transparently translating between their PostGIS EWKB representation and Python objects.

PPyGIS is written in pure Python. It has been tested with Python 2.7 and may work with earlier versions as well. A Python 3 version does not currently exist.
