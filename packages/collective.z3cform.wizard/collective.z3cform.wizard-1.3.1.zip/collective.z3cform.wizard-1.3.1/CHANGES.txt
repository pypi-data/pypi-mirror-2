* Moved the default wizard CSS to a browser resource which is available but
  not pulled in by anything by default.

* Adjusted the criteria for visibility of the Finish button so that it shows up
  on any step as long as data is stored in the session for all steps.
  Previously it was only shown on the final step.

* Added wizard navigation which lists the wizard's steps and links to ones
  that are available.

* Added support in the Wizard class for jumping to a particular step based
  on an index passed in the request (but only if that step is available).

* Adjusted the URL check that triggers session invalidation to not pay
  attention to the query string or fragment.

* Changed the updateCurrentStep method of the Wizard class (not part of the
  public API) to take a single parameter, the target step index.

* Added 'allStepsFinished' property to the Wizard class.

* Added 'available' property to the Step class.

* Added 'absolute_url' property to the Wizard class.

* Reset the wizard session if you leave it before finishing.
