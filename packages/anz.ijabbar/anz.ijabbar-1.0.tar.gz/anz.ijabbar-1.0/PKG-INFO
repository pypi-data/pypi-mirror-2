        anz.ijabbar was configured to connect our company's XMPP server by default. After you
        installed anz.ijabbar and refresh your page, you will login to our server as anonymous
        automatically. You can chat with us to experience the product. If you like it you should
        read the following section to do more integration work.
        
        Full Integration Works You Should Do?
        =====================================
        * Deploy your own XMPP server
        * Integrate your plone site with your XMPP server
        - users integration
        - friends mechanism
        - SSO
        - ...
        
        * Configure anz.ijabbar
        - login in as site administrator
        - goes to ZMI and enter {your site url}/portal_properties/anz_ijabbar_properties
        - configure as your situation
        
        Installation
        ============
        To install anz.ijabbar into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run
        ``easy_install anz.ijabbar``. Find out how to install setuptools
        (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * Create a file called ``anz.ijabbar-configure.zcml`` in the
        ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
        should only contain this::
        
        <include package="anz.ijabbar" />
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``anz.ijabbar`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        anz.ijabbar
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        anz.ijabbar
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        In Plone just add "anz.ijabbar" product with quick_installer, or install "anz.ijabbar"
        by portal_setup.
        
        ToDo
        ====
        * More documentations about integrate anz.ijabbar with your XMPP server.
        * Implement a 'friends mechanism', to let you only add your friends to your IM network.
        * SSO support.
