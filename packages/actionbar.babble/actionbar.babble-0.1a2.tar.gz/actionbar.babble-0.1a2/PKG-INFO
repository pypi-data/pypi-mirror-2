Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        actionbar.babble is the Babble chat client integration package for
        the ActionBar, an extensible floating panel with links at the
        bottom of your Plone site.
        
        For more information regarding Babble and ActionBar, please see their
        respective packages: babble.client, babble.server and actionbar.panel.
        
        
        How to use:
        -----------
        
        Just install actionbar.babble via the Plone control panel, or the
        portal_quickinstaller tool.
        
        actionbar.panel and babble.client will be installed automatically as well.
        
        Make sure that the portal_chat tool for babble.client is configured correctly.
        
        You should now automatically have the ActionBar at
        the bottom of your Plone site. At the bottom right, you will see a section
        called *Online Users*. Clicking on it will popup a dialog showing all the
        current online users you can chat with.
