# Use Cases for DataPkg (or: reasons to use it in the first place)

These use cases are not necessarily implemented but are a guide to what we are
*trying to do*.

## 1. Grabbing some data from an index

    >>> datapkg index-add file:///....
    >>> datapkg update
    >>> datapkg search "military spending"
    afjadadfajdjfkjadsf Military Spending 1890-1914
    afjadadfajdjfkjadsf Military Spending 1890-1914 (normalized)
    >>> datapkg install xyz
    ...
    >>> datapkg plot xyz

## 2. Grab two different files and use them together in some way.

What data?

  * Normalize data
    * Cross country and then convert to standard (e.g. US$, GBP)
      * Exchange rates
      * Cost of living
    * Changes across time and then do real present value
  * Plot two different data sources again each other.
    * Government expenditure in different sectors?

    >>> datapkg install pkg-a
    >>> datapkg install pkg-b
    >>> datapkg create merged
    # manual merge
    # e.g. PPP, GDP
    >>> datapkg register my-merged-package


## 3. Adding and index and then installing

    >>> datapkg add-index http://www.ckan.net/packages.ini
    >>> datapkg install ckan-wikipedia
