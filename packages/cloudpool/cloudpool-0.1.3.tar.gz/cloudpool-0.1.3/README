cloudpool is a Python library that provides a pool of processors for executing processes.  It is similar to the Python multiprocessing module, with two major differences:
* the pool is actually a threadpool of threads that manage underlying process
* the processor can be a remote host, thereby enabling applications that use this library to make use of cloud clusters such as those provided by Amazon's EC2

It requires the following:
* paramiko (http://www.lag.net/paramiko/)
* threadpool 1.2.7+ (http://www.chrisarndt.de/projects/threadpool/)

Once installed (see INSTALL for instructions), your Python application can use cloudpool as follows.

First, import the module:
        import cloudpool

See src/test/TestExecute for examples of usage.
