        DESCRIPTION
        ===========
        
        ftp-cloudfs is a ftp server acting as a proxy to Rackspace Cloud
        Files. It allow you to connect via any FTP client to do
        upload/download or create containers.
        
        By default the server will bind to port 2021 which allow to be run as
        a non root/administrator user.
        
        REQUIREMENT
        ===========
        
        - Python >= 2.5
        - python-cloudfiles >= 1.3.0  - http://github.com/rackspace/python-cloudfiles
        - pyftpdlib >= 0.5.2 - http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/
        
        Operating Systems
        =================
        
        This has been tested on a Debian testing Linux distribution but it
        should work on any Unices (including MacOSX) as long you have the
        requirement listed above. 
        
        It should as well work on Windows but this has been completely
        untested.
        
        INSTALL
        =======
        
        Use standard setup.py directives ie :
        
        python setup.py install
        
        USAGE
        ======
        
        The install should have created a /usr/bin/ftpcloudfs (or whatever
        prefix defined in your python distribution or command line arguments)
        which can be used like this :
        
        Usage: ftpcloudfs [OPTIONS].....

                                    Auth URL for alternate providers (eg OpenStack)
