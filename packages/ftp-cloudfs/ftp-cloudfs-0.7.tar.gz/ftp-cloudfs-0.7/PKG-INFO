        DESCRIPTION
        ===========
        
        ftp-cloudfs is a ftp server acting as a proxy to `Rackspace Cloud Files`_ or to `OpenStack Swift`_. It allow you to connect via any FTP client to do
        upload/download or create containers.
        
        By default the server will bind to port 2021 which allow to be run as
        a non root/administrator user.
        
        .. _OpenStack Swift: http://launchpad.net/swift
        .. _RackSpace Cloud Files: http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/
        
        It supports pseudo-hierachical folders/directories as described in the `Rackspace Cloud Files API`_ and the `OpenStack Object Storage API`_.
        
        .. _Rackspace Cloud Files API: http://docs.rackspacecloud.com/files/api/cf-devguide-latest.pdf
        .. _OpenStack Object Storage API: http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-object-storage/developer/content/
        
        REQUIREMENT
        ===========
        
        - Python >= 2.6 (probably 2.5 as well but not extensively tested)
        - python-cloudfiles >= 1.3.0  - http://github.com/rackspace/python-cloudfiles
        - pyftpdlib >= 0.6.0 - http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/
        - python-daemon >= 1.6 - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/
        
        Operating Systems
        =================
        
        This has been tested on a Debian testing Linux distribution but it
        should work on any Unices (including MacOSX) as long you have the
        requirement listed above. 
        
        It should as well work on Windows but this has been completely
        untested.
        
        INSTALL
        =======
        
        Use standard setup.py directives ie :
        
        python setup.py install
        
        Or if you have `pip`_ installed you can just do a ::
        
          pip install ftp-cloudfs
        
        which will install ftp-cloudfs with all the dependences needed.
        
        .. _`pip`: http://pip.openplans.org/
        
        USAGE
        ======
        
        The install should have created a /usr/bin/ftpcloudfs (or whatever
        prefix defined in your python distribution or command line arguments)
        which can be used like this :
        
        Usage: ftpcloudfs [OPTIONS].....
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -p PORT, --port=PORT  Port to bind the server default: 2021.
          -b BIND_ADDRESS, --bind-address=BIND_ADDRESS
                                Address to bind by default: 127.0.0.1.
          -a AUTHURL, --auth-url=AUTHURL
                                Auth URL for alternate providers(eg OpenStack)
          -s, --service-net     Connect via Rackspace ServiceNet network.
          -f, --foreground      Do not attempt to daemonize butrun in foreground.
          -l LOG_FILE, --log-file=LOG_FILE
                                Log File: Default stdout when in foreground
          --pid-file=PID_FILE   Pid file location when in daemon mode.
          --uid=UID             UID to drop the privilige to when in daemon mode
          --gid=GID             GID to drop the privilige to when in daemon mode
