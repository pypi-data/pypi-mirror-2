This tutorial presents a :mod:`repoze.bfg` application that uses
technologies which will be familiar to someone with :term:`Pylons`
experience.  It uses :term:`SQLAlchemy` as a persistence mechanism and
:term:`url dispatch` to map URLs to code.  It can also be followed by
people without any prior Python web framework experience.

To code along with this tutorial, the developer will need a UNIX
machine with development tools (Mac OS X with XCode, any Linux or BSD
variant, etc) *or* he will need a Windows system of any kind.

This tutorial is targeted at :mod:`repoze.bfg` version 1.3.

Have fun!
