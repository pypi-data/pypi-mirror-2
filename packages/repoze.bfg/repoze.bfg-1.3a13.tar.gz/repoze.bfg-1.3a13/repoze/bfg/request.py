    def add_response_callback(self, callback):

        Add a callback to the set of callbacks to be called by the
        :term:`router` at a point after a :term:`response` object is
        successfully created.  :mod:`repoze.bfg` does not have a
        global response object: this functionality allows an
        application to register an action to be performed against the
        response once one is created.

        A 'callback' is a callable which accepts two positional
        parameters: ``request`` and ``response``.  For example:

        .. code-block:: python
           :linenos:

           def cache_callback(request, response):
               'Set the cache_control max_age for the response'
               response.cache_control.max_age = 360
           request.add_response_callback(cache_callback)

        Response callbacks are called in the order they're added
        (first-to-most-recently-added).  No response callback is
        called if an exception happens in application code, or if the
        response object returned by :term:`view` code is invalid.

        All response callbacks are called *after* the
        :class:`repoze.bfg.interfaces.INewResponse` event is sent.

        Errors raised by callbacks are not handled specially.  They
        will be propagated to the caller of the :mod:`repoze.bfg`
        router application.

        .. note: ``add_response_callback`` is new in :mod:`repoze.bfg`
           1.3.

        See also: :ref:`using_response_callbacks`.
        """

        callbacks = self.response_callbacks
        if not callbacks:
            callbacks = []
        callbacks.append(callback)
        self.response_callbacks = callbacks

    def _process_response_callbacks(self, response):
        callbacks = self.response_callbacks
        while callbacks:
            callback = callbacks.pop(0)
            callback(self, response)

    def add_finished_callback(self, callback):
        """
        Add a callback to the set of callbacks to be called
        unconditionally by the :term:`router` at the very end of
        request processing.

        ``callback`` is a callable which accepts a single positional
        parameter: ``request``.  For example:

        .. code-block:: python
           :linenos:

           import transaction

           def commit_callback(request):
               '''commit or abort the transaction associated with request'''
               if request.exception is not None:
                   transaction.abort()
               else:
                   transaction.commit()
           request.add_finished_callback(commit_callback)

        Finished callbacks are called in the order they're added (
        first- to most-recently- added).  Finished callbacks (unlike
        response callbacks) are *always* called, even if an exception
        happens in application code that prevents a response from
        being generated.

        The set of finished callbacks associated with a request are
        called *very late* in the processing of that request; they are
        essentially the last thing called by the :term:`router`. They
        are called after response processing has already occurred in a
        top-level ``finally:`` block within the router request
        processing code.  As a result, mutations performed to the
        ``request`` provided to a finished callback will have no
        meaningful effect, because response processing will have
        already occurred, and the request's scope will expire almost
        immediately after all finished callbacks have been processed.

        Errors raised by finished callbacks are not handled specially.
        They will be propagated to the caller of the :mod:`repoze.bfg`
        router application.

        .. note: ``add_finished_callback`` is new in :mod:`repoze.bfg`
