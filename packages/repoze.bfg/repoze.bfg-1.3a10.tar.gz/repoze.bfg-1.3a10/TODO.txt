:mod:`repoze.bfg` TODOs
=======================

- Supply ``X-Vhm-Host`` support.

- Basic WSGI documentation (pipeline / app / server).

- Provide a webob.Response class facade for forward compat.

- Fix message catalog extraction / compilation documentation.

- Change docs about creating a venusian decorator to not use ZCA.

- ``decorator=`` parameter to bfg_view.

- Try to better explain the relationship between a renderer and a
  template in the templates chapter and elsewhere.  Scan the
  documentation for reference to a renderer as *only* view
  configuration (it's a larger concept now).

- Create a ``render_view`` that works by using config.derive_view
  against an existing view instead of querying the registry.

- Create a function which performs a recursive request.

- Debug option to print route matching decision.

- Debug option to print view matching decision.

- Script or paster command that prints, for a given URL, the views
  that might match.  Underneath each potentially matching route, list
  the predicates required.  Underneath each route+predicate set, print
  each view that might match and its predicates.  E.g. with the input
  URL ``/foo``::

    '/foo' (foo_xhr)
       xhr = True
         (no view predicates)
           mypackage.views.MyXHRFooView.__call__

    '/{action}' (action_route)
       request_method = 'POST'
         action = '^foo$'
           mypackage.views.MyView.foo_POST
       request_method = 'GET'
         action = '^foo$'
           mypackage.views.MyView.foo_GET

- Ability to use configurator as a context manager.

- Switch tutorials and templates to non-ZCML.

- Race condition when caching templates:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/karl3/+bug/621364.

- Provide a response_cookies attribute on the request for rendered
  responses that can be used as input to response.set_cookie.

- Raise an exception when a value in response_headerlist is not a
  string or decide to encode.

- Change docs so that we dont use INewReponse, but instead just
  NewResponse (likewise for INewRequest, etc).

- Change "Cleaning up After a Request" in the urldispatch chapter to
  use ``request.add_response_callback``.

- Add a default_view_permission setting:

  From IRC: if I use something like http://bfg.repoze.org/pastebin/764
  (does it even make any sense?), why do I still have to put
  view_permission="something_random" inside every <route>, so that
  those alc's kick in? or am I doing it completely wrong?
