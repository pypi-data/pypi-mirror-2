:mod:`repoze.bfg` TODOs
=======================

- Supply ``X-Vhm-Host`` support.

- Basic WSGI documentation (pipeline / app / server).

- Provide a webob.Response class facade for forward compat.

- Fix message catalog extraction / compilation documentation.

- Change docs about creating a venusian decorator to not use ZCA.

- Add a ``susbcriber`` decorator and docs.

- ``decorator=`` parameter to bfg_view.

- Try to better explain the relationship between a renderer and a
  template in the templates chapter and elsewhere.  Scan the
  documentation for reference to a renderer as *only* view
  configuration (it's a larger concept now).

- The ``system`` value passed to a renderer is not extensible.  It
  should be extensible on a per-application basis.  For example, you
  might want to add a top-level variable ``c`` to the values passed to
  all renderers representing a template context to emulate Pylons.

- ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_zpt.render_template_to_response``, et. al. do
  not use the same machinery as view renderers.  It would be useful if
  templates rendered with ``render_template_to_response`` had the same
  ``system`` values available to it as templates renderered via a view
  renderer.
