General
================================================================

This project exposes a way to load classes dynamically and to
make sure that each class that is loaded has and adheres to one 
or more verifiable interfaces.



Project Name
================================================================

The project name started as simply "class registry", but that 
seemed really dull and boring.  Totally not entertaining.  So, 
my wife and I brainstormed and we came up with the idea of a 
plant, which is both something that grows and somthing that 
simply produces items according to technical specification
(AKA factory).  Then, I started to consider the types of plants
that we grow which create hearty staples, and potatos came to 
mind.  And yes, I could have used "potato plant", but that 
was too long, so now its just "potato".  My wife wanted to 
call it "pytatoe", but I said that that was too cheesy.  



Motivation
================================================================

I wanted a system for a plug-in architecture.  I got the idea 
for this project from the following stackoverflow.com question:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145378/dynamic-module-import-
of-class-list-from-module-given-its-full-path

As I developed it, it became apparent that a construct and/or
pattern must have been used in the making of such evil software
as Microsoft Windows.



Usage
