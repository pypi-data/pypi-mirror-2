        Buildout Installation
        ---------------------
        
        Add the following code to your buildout.cfg to install plone.formwidget.recaptcha::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                plone.formwidget.recaptcha
                ...
        
            ...
            [instance]
            ...
            zcml =
                ...
                plone.formwidget.recaptcha
            ...
        
        
        ReCaptcha setup
        ---------------
        
        In order to use ReCaptcha on your Plone site, you need
        an account on `recaptcha.net`_. Go to
        `recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html`_ to create an
        account and to receive your private and public key.
        
        If you don't want to rely on an external service for
        captcha, you might want to consider using
        plone.formwidget.captcha instead.
        
        After creating an account, go to the ReCaptcha control panel
        (your-site/@@recaptcha-settings) and fill in your personal
        ReCaptcha keys.
