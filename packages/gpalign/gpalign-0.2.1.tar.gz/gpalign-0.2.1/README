Grapheme-phoneme aligner
========================

Alignment code
--------------

This is the grapheme-phoneme alignment algorithm described in the paper

    Yencken, Lars and Baldwin, Tim
    "Efficient grapheme-phoneme alignment for Japanese"
    Proceedings of ALTW 2005, Sydney, pp. 143-151 (2005).
    (Available: http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~lljy/papers/alta-2005.pdf)

For a broader outline of the purpose of this software, please see the original
paper.

For all intents and purposes, this software is legacy. However, it is still
used to align the EDICT dictionary for the FOKS dictionary interface.
