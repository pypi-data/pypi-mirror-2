Introduction
============

This product simplifies FacultyStaffDirectory to make it more user-friendly.  
It hides tabs that most users don't need to see when editing their profile
and cleans up some visual clutter.  The options remain visible to Managers and Personnel 
Managers who may need to access them.

In particular, this product will:

* Hide the Contents, Sharing, and Relations tabs from the user (when viewing their Person).

* Hide the Actions and Display menus from the user (when viewing their Person).

* Hide the User Settings, categorization, dates, ownership, and settings schema from the user
  (when editing their Person).

* Correct the versioning configuration so that the "Save as new version" box
  will not display at the bottom of the profile edit view (unless versioning is
  enabled).

* Make the username in the personal bar link directly to the FSD profile,
  instead of the Plone dashboard (and hide the default FSD 'My Folder' link).
  
You should install FacultyStaffDirectory first before using this product.
