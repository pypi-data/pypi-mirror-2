Description: Introduction
        *************
        
        This is a one line recipe to allow buildout users to refer to ${grp:GROUP} to get the current
        user's group. In other words, the results of `id -g -n` on UNIX systems for the person executing 
        the buildout. This can be handy in combination with the 'gocept.recipe.env' recipe, when setting 
        ownership on the contents of a buildout, e.g. chown -R  ${env:USER}:${grp:GROUP} ${buildout:directory}
