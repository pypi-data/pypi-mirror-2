Description: rbco.statcvswrapper
        ===================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        rbco.statcvswrapper is an wrapper around StatCVS_ to make it more straightforward to use. It also
        solves a problem: it corrects the encoding so accentuation is displayed correctly in the generated
        reports.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        1. Download the StatCVS jar from its website.
        2. Add an environment variable called ``STATCVS_JAR_PATH`` with the full path to the downloaded JAR.
        Example: ``export STATCVS_JAR_PATH=/home/rafaelb/statcvs.jar``. Normally you want to put this
        at the end of your ``~/.bashrc`` file.
        3. Use Python's setuptools to install rbco.statcvswrapper.
        Example: ``easy_install rbco.statcvswrapper``
        
        Running
        -------
        
        1. Change into your working copy directory.
        2. Do a ``cvs update``.
        3. Run ``statcvs_wrapper .``.
        
        This will issue the command to get the log from CVS, run StatCVS, correct the encoding of the
        report and open the report in Firefox.
