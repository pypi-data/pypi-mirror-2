Description: What is it?
        ===========
        
        ftw.calendar is a calendar view based on fullcalendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar).
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Generic: ftw.calendar doesn't care about the event objects, it only needs a collection in which the resulting brains have a start and a end attribute.
        
        * Lightweight: the only requirement (apart from plone of course) is simplejson. Optionally, if you want to enable resizing of events and the drag and drop functionality, you can install jquery.ui but thats up to you.
        
        * Internationalized: currently ftw.calendar is available in german and english. Feel free to add more translations. The translations and date formats are located in the javascript files in the skin directory.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Install ftw.calendar using the quickinstaller and select calendar_view as the new default view on any collection. The default events-collection in a new plone site should work well, you probably should remove the date criterions though, since fullcalendar needs to be able to set them according to the selected month.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        Often there are javascript-errors just after installing and trying the calendar view. Normally these are due to javascript caching and can be easily solved by enabling javascript debugging in the js_registry.
