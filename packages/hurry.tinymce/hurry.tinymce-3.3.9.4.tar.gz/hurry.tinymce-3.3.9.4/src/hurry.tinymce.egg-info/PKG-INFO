        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages TinyMCE_ for `hurry.resource`_.
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        
        .. _TinyMCE: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``tinymce`` like this::
        
        from hurry.tinymce import tinymce
        
        And then to trigger inclusion in the web page, anywhere within
        your page or widget rendering code, do this::
        
        tinymce.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and
        ``hurry.resource``, and making sure that the original resources
        (shipped in the ``tinymce-build`` directory in ``hurry.tinymce``) are
        published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you
        depend on the `hurry.zopetinymce`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the
        above example should work out of the box. Starting with version
        3.2.3.0.1 you do not need `hurry.zopetinymce`_ anymore. Instead it is
        sufficient to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your
        ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zopetinymce`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zopetinymce
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.tinymce before release
        ======================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.tinymce``; if
        you don't know whether you are, you aren't.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.tinymce``, an extra step should be
        taken. Follow the regular package `release instructions`_, but before
        egg generation (``python setup.py register sdist upload``) first
        execute ``bin/tinymceprepare <version number>``, where version number is
        the version of the TinyMCE release, such as ``3.2.0.2``. This will download
        the TinyMCE code of that version and place it in the egg.

        CHANGES
        *******
        
        3.3.9.4 (2011-09-07)
        ====================
        
        * Upgrade to TinyMCE version 3.3.9.4
        
        * Add ability to specify additional languages which are downloaded and
        installed to TinyMCE. By default, german is installed additionally.
        
        * Change download behaviour to match the current TinyMCE download
        infrastructure.
        
        * Pin version of hurry.recource to 0.9.1 because newer version have
        incompatible api changes.
        
        3.2.3.1 (2009-05-04) (TinyMCE version: 3.2.3)
        =============================================
        
        * Upgrade to TinyMCE version 3.2.3.
        
        * Add ZCML configuration from `hurry.zopetinymce`. With Zope you can
        now use `hurry.tinymce` without additional
        `hurry.zopetinymce`. Please make sure, however, that
        `hurry.zoperesource` is available at runtime.
        
        * Modified ``prepare.py`` to also cope with changed directory
        structure of TinyMCE 3.2.3.
        
        3.2.0.2 (2008-10-13) (TinyMCE version: 3.2.0.2)
