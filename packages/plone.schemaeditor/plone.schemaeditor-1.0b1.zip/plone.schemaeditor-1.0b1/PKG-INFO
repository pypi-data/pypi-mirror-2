Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.schemaeditor provides a through-the-web interface for modifying Zope 3
        schemata (interfaces).
        
        Currently there is support for:
        
        * adding and removing fields
        * editing attributes of existing fields
        * reordering fields
        * renaming fields
        
        plone.schemaeditor only handles the actual schema editing.  To be useful, it
        requires some integration code to take care of the following pieces:
        
        * traversing to a schema that is used as the context of the editor
        * persisting schema changes across Zope restarts
        
        See plone.app.dexterity (along with plone.dexterity and plone.supermodel) for
        one approach to this integration.
        
        The following field types (from zope.schema) are currently supported:
        
        * TextLine
        * Text
        * Int
        * Float
        * Bool
        * Password
        * Datetime
        * Choice (with simple list of values)
        * List of Choice (with simple list of values)
        
        Third-party packages can make additional field types available by registering
        new IFieldFactory utilities.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * Zope 2
        * z3c.form
        * plone.z3cform
        
        Despite the namespace, Plone is not a dependency.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b1 - 2010-04-18
        ------------------
        
        * Added overlay support to the field edit screens.
        [davisagli, limi]
        
        * Revamped UI to show WYSIWYG representation of fields.
        [davisagli, limi]
        
        * Removed the JavascriptFormWrapper.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Major package cleanup.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Omit the 'required' and 'missing_value' fields for Bool fields.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Add the ability to define vocabularies of simple TextLine values.
        Both single and multiple select fields are provided.
        [rossp]
        
        * Override base field interfaces to get the correct field types for the default
        and missing_value fields, rather than using the MetaFieldWidgetFactory.
        [rossp]
        
        * Make sure that normalized ids for new fields use _ instead of -, so that they
        can be accessed without using getattr.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fix issue with moving fields to position 0 in a schema.
        [davisagli]
        
        * List the available field type vocabulary alphabetically.
        [davisagli]
        
        * No longer provide a field factory for zope.schema.Bytes, since
        plone.namedfile provides a better file field and now registers its own field
        factories.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fix inline validation for the field edit form.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Added ReadOnlySchemaListing for listing fields without making them editable.
        [davisagli]
        
        * CSS tweaks
        [davisagli]
        
        
        1.0a2 - 2009-07-12
        ------------------
        
        * Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
        the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
        apologies, but it's now or never. :-/
        
        If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
        code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. add_field() becomes
        addField().
