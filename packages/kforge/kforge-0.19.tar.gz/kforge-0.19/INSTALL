##  Quick Instructions

Use the KForge virtualenv script to generate a KForge service in an
isolated virtual Python environment. KForge will be set up with an SQLite
database, you can switch database backends later.

1.  Prepare by checking these packages are installed (Debian package names):

        apache2-mpm-prefork
        build-essential
        libapache2-mod-python  (optional legacy alternative to mod_wsgi)
        libapache2-mod-wsgi
        python
        python-dev
        sqlite3
        libsqlite3-dev

    If you want to use the PostgreSQL database, then make sure the server
    package with the PostgreSQL development files is installed, e.g.:

        postgresql-server-dev-8.3

    If you want to use Git or Subversion with Trac, then check these packages
    are also installed (Debian package names):

        git-core
        libapache2-svn
        subversion
        python-subversion

    If you want to use DAV or Subversion make sure the Apache modules are
    enabled:

        $ sudo a2enmod dav
        $ sudo a2enmod dav_fs
        $ sudo a2enmod dav_svn

2.  Download the KForge installer (and make it executable):

        $ curl -O http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/docs/kforge-virtualenv
        $ chmod +x kforge-virtualenv

3.  Run the KForge installer. Note that the PATH folder should never be 
    under DocumentRoot of the Apache installation or any other directory
    exposed via Apache web server:
 
        $ ./kforge-virtualenv PATH

    The installer will download and install the KForge system, and then create
    a service instance with KForge config file, HTML templates, static media,
    an SQLite database, and an auto-generated Apache configuration file.


4.  Include the generated Apache configuration file in a dedicated Apache
    virtual host, restart Apache, and load KForge in your favorite browser.

5.  Later, switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL.

##  Overview of Install Process

The KForge install steps are summarised here. Details are provided below.

The install process is automated by the KForge installer, a virtualenv script,
which can be used either manually or automatically with the Provide system.

1.  Prepare the operating system platform.
    *   Python (and a few common packages)
    *   Database server
    *   Web server

2.  Prepare the database management system (optional).
    *   Database user
    *   Database user permissions
    *   Database instance

3.  Install KForge software (and dependencies).
    *   In virtual Python environment (or global site packages).

4.  Set up the KForge service.
    *   Create a KForge configuration file.
    *   Edit the KForge configuration file.
    *   Create the KForge template and media files.
    *   Create a KForge database.
    *   Create a KForge Apache configuration file.

5.  Configure Apache for the KForge service.
    *   Include the KForge Apache configuration file.
    *   Change ownership of KForge service files.
    *   Configure reloading of Apache configuration.

6.  Visit the KForge service.
    *   Restart the Apache service.
    *   Load the KForge service in your browser.

7.  Troubleshoot.

##  Automated Install Options

There are two options for an automated installation. Either you can use
the KForge virtualenv script, or you can use the Provide system.

If you use the KForge virtualenv script, you will still need to prepare the
platform (and optionally a database management system) before installation,
and you will still need to prepare an Apache virtual host after installation.

If you use the Provide system, you will stll need to prepare the platform
before installation. Provide will prepare the database and configure Apache.

### 1. Deploy KForge using the KForge virtualenv script.

The KForge virtualenv script is an application of virtualenv. It will
prepare a new virtual Python environment, install KForge into it. A new
KForge service will be set up (optionally not with --skip-service-setup),
but you will need to configure Apache for the KForge service.

1.  Download and run the KForge virtualenv script:

        $ wget http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/docs/kforge-virtualenv
        $ chmod +x kforge-virtualenv

    For information about options, read the usage message:

        $ ./kforge-virtualenv --help
        Usage: kforge-virtualenv [OPTIONS] KFORGE_DIR
        
        Options:
        ...

    1.  The only required argument is KFORGE_DIR, a folder for the new KForge
        virtualenv installation. Note that KFORGE_DIR folder should never be 
        under DocumentRoot of the Apache installation or any other directory
        exposed via Apache web server:

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv /path/to/kforge

        If you only want to install the software, and not set up a service:

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --skip-service-setup /path/to/kforge

    2.  However, you will probably want at least to set your own service name:

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --service-name MyForge /path/to/kforge

    3.  If you will upgrade KForge in future, you may wish to place the project
        data folder in a separate place now. It will contain e.g. Subversion
        repositories and Trac environments, which in general can't be moved
        once created, and so will continue to be used by new versions after
        upgrading.
    
            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --project-data-dir /path/to/kforge/data   \
             --service-name MyForge /path/to/kforge/version

    4.  The installer will attempt to create and initialise the database. If
        the database user, the database password, and database name are set
        (with the --db-user, --db-pass, and --db-name options), they will be
        used by default to create a PostgreSQL database.

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --db-user DBUSER --db-pass DBPASS         \
            --db-name DBNAME --project-data-dir /path/to/kforgedata         \
            --service-name MyForge /path/to/kforge

        Of course, in this case the database user needs the privilege to
        create the database. However, if the database user does not have
        the privilege to create the database, then create the database before
        running the installer, and use the --skip-db-create option.

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --skip-db-create --db-user DBUSER         \
            --db-pass DBPASS --db-name DBNAME --project-data-dir            \
            /path/to/kforgedata --service-name MyForge /path/to/kforge

        If you want to use MySQL, set the database type to 'mysql' (with
        the --db-type option).

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --db-type mysql --db-user DBUSER          \
            --db-pass DBPASS --db-name DBNAME --project-data-dir            \
            /path/to/kforgedata --service-name MyForge /path/to/kforge

        If no --db- options are provided, an SQLite database will be created
        and initialised, as if the following --db- options has been set:

            --db-name /path/to/kforge/var/sqlite.db --db-type sqlite

        If the database can't be created by the installer, you will need to
        create and initialise the database using the installed 'kforge-admin'
        command. Make sure your database software and credentials are okay.
        In this case, you will also need to generate the KForge Apache
        configuration file. Refer to the detailed step-by-step instructions.

    5.  If you are upgrading from an existing service, prepare by creating a
        migration dump file from the existing service.
            
            $ source /path/to/existing/kforge/bin/activate
            (kforge)$ kforge-admin db dump DUMPPATH

        Then, set the prepared domain data file (with the --dump-file option).
        Set the *same* service name, db user, db pass, and project data folder
        as the existing service. Set a *different* database name from that
        used by the existing service, and a *different* KFORGE_DIR from that
        used by the existing service.

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --dump-file DUMPPATH --db-user DBUSER     \
            --db-pass DBPASS --db-name NEWDBNAME --project-data-dir         \
            /path/to/kforgedata --service-name MyForge NEWKFORGE_DIR

        Warning: If you are upgrading from 0.16, and you have used the Trac
        plugin to create Trac services, then you need to tweak that domainmodel
        code. Find dm/migrate.py, and add the following lines:

            # Load plugin model classes into domain class register.
            self.pluginController = RequiredFeature("PluginController")
            self.pluginController.getPlugins()

        So that the domain model dumper class starts like this:

            class DomainModelDumper(object):

                def __init__(self):
                    self.registry = RequiredFeature("DomainRegistry")
                    self.dictionary = RequiredFeature("SystemDictionary")
                    self.jsonDataDump = ''
                    self.dataDump = None
                    # Load plugin model classes into domain class register.
                    self.pluginController = RequiredFeature("PluginController")
                    self.pluginController.getPlugins()

                def dumpData(self):
        
        Then, use 'kforge-admin migratedump' instead of 'kforge-admin db dump'.

    6.  If you want to boost the performance of the access controller, then
        enable memoization (with the '--enable-memoization' option):

            $ ./kforge-virtualenv --enable-memoization --db-user DBUSER     \
            --db-pass DBPASS --db-name DBNAME --project-data-dir            \
            /path/to/kforgedata --service-name MyForge /path/to/kforge


2.  After running the installer, try activating the new KForge virtualenv.

        $ source /path/to/kforge/bin/activate
        (kforge)$ 

    Please note, the environment variable KFORGE_SETTINGS now has the path
    to the new KForge configuration file.
        
        (kforge)$ echo $KFORGE_SETTINGS
        /path/to/kforge/etc/kforge.conf

    Please note, you may undo the activatation of the virtualenv with 'deactivate'.

        (kforge)$ deactivate
        $

    But don't do that now. :-)

    Compare the new KForge configuration file with the existing service,
    and carry any preferences for log levels, memoization, secret key,
    email address, and so on over to the new KForge configuration file.

        (kforge)$ vim $KFORGE_SETTINGS

3.  After activation, check the 'kforge-admin' script is available:
 
        (kforge)$ which kforge-admin
        /path/to/kforge/bin/kforge-admin
        (kforge)$ kforge-admin --version

4.  If you are upgrading from an existing service, any plugins that were
    enabled in the existing service will already be enabled in the new,
    but you may need again to add the plugin configuration section again
    to the KForge configuration file.
    
    Otherwise, if you are creating a new service, you must enable plugins
    before project administrators will be able to create project services.

    Discover all available plugins with the 'kforge-admin plugin choices'
    command.

        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin choices
        dav
        joomla
        mailman
        mercurial
        moin
        notify
        svn
        trac
        wordpress
        www

    List the enabled plugins with the 'kforge-admin plugin list' command.

        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin list
        dav
        www

    For each plugin you would to use, read the 'plugin doc', then 'plugin enable'
    the plugin, and then 'plugin show' its status. You won't be able to enable
    a plugin if its dependencies aren't available on your system.

    [Example] Enable the Trac, Subversion, and Mercurial plugins.

        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin enable trac
        The 'trac' plugin is now enabled (see 'doc' and 'status').
        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin enable svn
        The 'svn' plugin is now enabled (see 'doc' and 'status').
        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin enable mercurial
        The 'mercurial' plugin is now enabled (see 'doc' and 'status').
        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin list
        dav
        mercurial
        svn
        trac
        www

    [Example] Read the documentation for the Subversion plugin.

        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin doc mercurial
        ...

    [Example] Read the status of the Subversion plugin.

        (kforge)$ kforge-admin plugin status mercurial
        ...

    Please refer the the KForge User Guide for more information.


5.  Configure Apache. Configure Apache reloading. Restart and load in browser.

    See below for details.


### 2. Deploy KForge using the Provide system (experimental).

Like KForge, the Provide system is an application of DomainModel. It will
create a new virtual Python environment, install KForge into it, and
then set up several KForge services.
 
It will optionally configure and restart Apache. It will test the 
software before production deployment, and it will allow data migrations to
be verified before cutting users over to new versions.

1.  Read about Provide, learn about the working process it supports.

    <http://appropriatesoftware.net/provide/>

2.  Download and deploy Provide.

    <http://kforge.appropriatesoftware.net/provide/trac/wiki#DeployingProvide>

3.  Deploy KForge inside Provide.

    Provide a new KForge version x.xx service with these commands:

        $ provide scripts kforge x.xx
        $ provide-kforge-init
        $ provide-kforge-x.xx-init
        $ provide-kforge-x.xx-accept
        $ provide-kforge-x.xx-production

    Migrate from an existing KForge version y.yy service with:

        $ provide scripts kforge x.xx
        $ provide-kforge-x.xx-init
        $ provide-kforge-x.xx-accept-from-y.yy
        $ provide-kforge-x.xx-production-from-y.yy

    Later, migrate to a future KForge version z.zz with:

        $ provide scripts kforge z.zz
        $ provide-kforge-z.zz-init
        $ provide-kforge-z.zz-accept-from-x.xx
        $ provide-kforge-z.zz-production-from-x.xx

Todo: More information about using KForge with Provide.


##  Detailed Step-by-Step Install Instructions

### 1. Prepare Platform

Please ensure you have available on your system the following:

* Python language >= v2.3 (python on Debian)
* Header files and a static library for Python (python-dev on Debian) 
* Apache >= v2.0 (apache2 on Debian)
    * Modpython (libapache2-mod-python on Debian)
    * [optional] ssl (libapache2-mod-ssl on Debian)
* RDBMS PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite (postgresql, mysql-server, or sqlite3)

If you wish to use Subversion, Mercurial and Git, ensure you also have:

* Subversion (subversion on Debian)
* Mercurial (mercurial on Debian)
* Git (git-core on Debian)

If you are using PostgreSQL and KForge won't have access to global Python
packages, ensure you also have:

* PostgreSQL development files (postgresql-server-dev-8.3 on Debian Lenny)

If KForge will have access to global Python packages, installing the following
Python packages with the system package manager is probably easiest:

* Python DB bindings (python-psycopg2, python-mysqldb, or python-sqlite)
* Egenix DateTime packages (python-egenix-mxdatetime on Debian)

Please note, it's possible to run without installing Egenix DateTime globally.
However, if you wish to use PostgreSQL on Debian then you will discover that
the python-psycopg2 package depends on python-egenix-mxdatetime package. In
this case, installing egenix-mx-base from the Python package index can cause
conflicts and occasionally lead to strange errors. Of course, it is possible
and sometimes necessary to install egenix-mx-base and psycopg2 locally (e.g.
into a virtual environment), but it is much easier to use the system (e.g.
Debian) packages. Other similar conflicts could arise, depending on what you
have installed, so keep things simple if you can.


### 2. Prepare Database Management System

If necessary, please consult the instructions for your database system. 

Todo: Link to PostgreSQL manual.
Todo: Link to MySQL manual.
Todo: Link to SQLite manual.

1.  Decide a database type for KForge to use. You can use PostgreSQL, MySQL,
    SQLite, or (probably) any other system supported by SQLObject.

2.  Decide a database instance name for KForge to use. If you are using
    SQLite, the database name will be a filesystem path.

3.  If necessary, create a database user for KForge to use and set a password
    for the user. If necessary, configure the database management system to
    allow this user to access the KForge database instance via TCP/IP sockets.
    If you are using PostgreSQL, then edit the pg_hba.conf file. If you are
    using SQLite there is no need to create any database user, or set any
    password.

4.  [optional] Create the database instance. You can also create the database
    instance after the KForge configuration file has been created by using
    the 'kforge-admin db create' command (see below), but then the KForge
    database user must have been given permission to create databases. If you
    don't want the KForge database user to be able to create databases, create
    the database instance now. If you are using sqlite, there is no need to do
    anything here.

5.  Remember the database instance name, any database user name and password, and
    the database host name if it is different from 'localhost'. You will need to
    write these values into the KForge configuration file (generated below).


### 3. Install KForge Software

Decide how KForge will be installed. It is recommended that you establish an
isolated installation inside a virtual Python environment (virtualenv). It is
also possible, of course, to install KForge to your global Python packages.

EITHER - Install KForge into a virtual Python environment.

1.  Create and activate a new virtual Python environment.

        $ virtualenv /path/to/kforge

    Note that KForge should never be installed under DocumentRoot of the
    Apache installation or any other directory exposed via Apache web server.

2.  Activate the new virtual Python environment.

        $ source /path/to/kforge/bin/activate
        (kforge)$

3.  Install the KForge Python package using virtual easy_install:

        (kforge)$ which easy_install
        /path/to/kforge/bin/easy_install
        (kforge)$ easy_install kforge

4.  After installation, check the KForge scripts are available:

        (kforge)$ which kforge-makeconfig
        /path/to/kforge/bin/kforge-makeconfig
        (kforge)$ which kforge-admin
        /path/to/kforge/bin/kforge-admin

5.  After creating the configuration file, make sure to set the 
    virtualenv bin_dir value /path/to/kforge/bin. Then copy the 
    .../kforge/handlers/kforgevirtualenvhandlers.py file from the KForge
    Python library into that virtualenv bin. This ensures Apache can access
    the code from the virtual environment.

OR - Install the KForge Python package into global Python packages.

1.  EITHER - Install using easy_install (python-setuptools on Debian):

        $ sudo easy_install kforge

    OR - Download the stable tarball, extract it, change into the distribution
    root directory (folder containing the KForge setup.py file), and run:

        $ python setup.py install

    Please note, if you experience trouble downloading the 'markdown' Python
    package, then you'll have to try again - regular testing has shown that
    its download service is relatively unreliable.

2.  After installation, check the KForge scripts are available:

        $ which kforge-makeconfig
        /usr/bin/kforge-makeconfig
        $ which kforge-admin
        /usr/bin/kforge-admin


### 4. Set up KForge Service

1.  Create a KForge configuration file:

        $ kforge-makeconfig /path/to/kforge/etc/kforge.conf

    There are lots of options for setting configuration values

        $ kforge-makeconfig --help
        $ kforge-makeconfig [OPTIONS] /path/to/kforge/etc/kforge.conf
    
    [optional]: You may wish to set the environment variable KFORGE_SETTINGS
    to point to your KForge configuration file. It will save you having to
    use the --config option with kforge-admin. Set the environment with:

        $ export KFORGE_SETTINGS=/path/to/kforge/etc/kforge.conf

2.  Edit the configuration file with your favorite editor.

    Please note, you can adjust a prefix for all config paths with the 
    'master_path' variable. It is used only to expand other path variables in 
    the example configuration file. But it is equally possible to set the
    other path variables independently, and remove this variable from the
    KForge configuration file entirely.

    1.  The name of your KForge service:

        Enter a name for your KForge service ('service_name'). This name can be
        any unicode string. It will be used instead of 'KForge'.

    2.  The folder for your KForge project service data:

        KForge will need to write to a folder where data from KForge project 
        services will be stored. If it doesn't exist, KForge will attempt to
        create this folder (and parent folders that don't exist).

        Enter a filesystem path for KForge project data ('project_data_dir').

    3.  [optional] The path to the virtual environment bin folder:

        If you installed KForge into a virtual environment, uncomment and 
        enter the absolute filesystem path to the bin folder ('bin_dir').

    4.  The timezone of your KForge service:

        KForge will show time local to the timezone of the service. This affects
        logging messages, and other time sensitive features.

        Enter your timezone ('timezone') e.g Europe/London.

    5.  The KForge log file:

        KForge will attempt to write log messages to file.

        Enter a filesystem path for the KForge log file ('log_file').

        NB: KForge will attempt to create this file (and any parent folders
        that don't exist).

        Todo: More documentation about log levels.

    6.  The KForge database:

        KForge will need to access a database. You will need to enter the 
        database values you remembered above.

        Enter the database type ('type') as 'postgres', 'mysql', or 'sqlite'.

        Enter a database username and password, and name for the KForge database
        instance ('user', 'pass', 'name'). If you are using SQLite, use the
        database name ('name') to set a filesystem path to a new file.

        Your database tables and initial records will be generated later with
        the "kforge-admin db init" command. If you didn't already create the
        database instance, you will also use "kforge-admin db create".

    7.  The KForge HTML templates:

        KForge will read a folder of templates files (Django templates used to
        generate HTML pages in response to KForge client requests).

        Enter a filesystem path for the KForge templates folder ('templates_dir').

        NB: Your KForge template folder will be generated below (with the
        "kforge-admin fs create" command). KForge will attempt to 
        create this folder (and any parent folders that do not exist). An error
        will occur if this folder already exists.

    8.  The KForge media files:

        KForge will configure Apache to serve a folder of media files (images,
        CSS, and Javascript files) that will be used by KForge clients to
        complete the HTML pages they receive.

        Enter a filesystem path for a KForge media folder ('media_dir').

        NB: Your KForge media folder will be generated below (with the
        "kforge-admin fs create" command). KForge will attempt to create
        this folder (and any parent folders that do not exist). An error will
        occur if this folder already exists.

    9.  The KForge Apache configuration file: 

        KForge will update a fragment of Apache configuration, to reflect changes
        to KForge project services as they happen.

        Enter an Apache configuration file ('apache\_config\_file').

        NB: The Apache configuration file will be generated below (with the
        "kforge-admin apacheconfig create" command). If it doesn't exist, 
        KForge will attempt to create this file (and parent folders that do
        not exist). Any existing file will be overwritten.

    10. Configuration of the KForge plugins.

        Please check the configuration values for any plugins you wish to use.

        Any problems, just ask for help on the mailing list.
        
        Todo: More documentation about plugin configuration.
        Todo: Resolve this section with section 1.4, perhaps make new section.

 
2.  Create KForge template and media files.

    Generate your KForge templates and media folders: 
 
        $ kforge-admin [--config KFORGE_SETTINGS] fs create

3.  [optional] Create database (only if you didn't do this above):

        $ kforge-admin [--config KFORGE_SETTINGS] db create

    This will use KForge's understanding of your database system. If it
    doesn't work out, just create a database instance by hand, using the
    database instance name you decided above.

4.  Initialise the database (creates the tables and initial records):

    EITHER: If you are creating a new service, initialise with defaults:

        $ kforge-admin [--config KFORGE_SETTINGS] db init

    OR: If you are upgrading from an existing service, load migrated data

        $ kforge-admin [--config KFORGE_SETTINGS] db init DUMPPATH

    Please note, you can dump data from the existing service by running *its*:

        $ kforge-admin [--config KFORGE_SETTINGS] db dump DUMPPATH

5. Generate KForge Apache configuration file (requires the database):

        $ kforge-admin [--config KFORGE_SETTINGS] apacheconfig create 


### 5. Configure Apache for KForge Service

1.  Include the generated KForge Apache configuration file (location is
    specified in the KForge configuration file) in your main apache config,
    for example within the VirtualHost for the domain on which you will
    run KForge. Use the Apache Include directive:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName kforge.mydomain.com
            Include /path/to/kforge/var/httpd-autogenerated.conf
            <IfModule mod_wsgi.c>
                WSGIDaemonProcess kforge threads=25 maximum-requests=1000
            </IfModule>
        </VirtualHost>
 
    As it will be regenerated as project services change. It is important to
    include the generated file, rather than copy its contents elsewhere.

2.  Give the Apache user (the user under which the web server runs) control
    of the project and log folders, and the auto-generated Apache
    configuration file:
       
        $ chown -R {www-user}:{www-user} {filesystem-path}

    There is further information on setting file permissions in the Extra
    Notes section below.

3.  Auto-reloading of Apache configuration (KForge modifies the Apache
    configuration file when project services are created, updated, and deleted).

    There is further information in the Extra Notes section below.

    1.  EITHER: Set KForge to auto reload apache by setting the 'reload_apache'
        config variable. Note that for this to work you will need to ensure 
        appropriate permissions are granted to the user under which the KForge
        system runs (more details below).

        OR: Automatically reload the apache configuration using some external
        means. For example, create a cron-job that automatically reloads apache
        configuration at regular intervals (example below) or a monitoring
        service of some kind (such as monit) to reload apache each time the
        apache config file is rebuilt (example below).


### 6. Attempt To Visit KForge Service

1.  Restart Apache with the normal command line command (perhaps something
like '/etc/init.d/apache2ctl restart'). 

2.  Now attempt to visit the KForge service in your browser. Does it load?


### 7. Troubleshoot

If you need to troubleshoot the KForge installation, try setting the
KForge configuration variable 'system_mode = development' in the [DEFAULT]
section of the KForge configuration file. Errors will be sent to the browser.

Any problems, please join the mailing list and ask for help.


##  Additional Notes

### 1. Setting File Permissions

Please note, some files need to be writable by the Apache user. By default,
these files are all contained within the /path/to/kforge/var folder:
 
* KForge auto-generated Apache configuration file
* Kforge log file
* KForge project data folder

The remaining files need only to be readable by the Apache user:

* KForge configuration file
* KForge template folder (and files)
* KForge media folder (and files)

For web access to work for KForge you must allow Apache to access the KForge
files. There are (at least) two options:

1.  Have the Apache user own all KForge files.  This may cause problems if
    you then wish to run command line utilities to administer KForge, since 
    you may not have permission to write to files and directories. You can
    also run the commands as the Apache user.

2.  Allow for dual access by the KForge user and the Apache user.

    A suitable umask value UMASK to allow group access is 002 or 007.

    1.  Set umask for <kforge-user> so that group also has write permissions.

        Add the following to the your environment config (e.g. ~/.bashrc):

            umask UMASK

    3.  Giving Apache user access to KForge service files by adding Apache to
        KForge group.
  
            $ usermod -GKFORGEGROUP APACHEUSER
  
    4.  Set umask for Apache to allow group access.

        Add the following to Apache startup script (usually /usr/sbin/apachectl
        or /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -- you can find it referenced in
        /etc/init.d/apache<version>):

            umask UMASK
      
    5.  Give group access to existing files and make sure new files and
        directories remain in the KForge group by setting sgid:

            $ chmod g+rX -R /path/to/kforge
            $ chmod g+wX -R /path/to/kforge/var

3.  Run Apache as a 'kforge' user. This may cause problems if you wish to
    use the Apache server for other things, but it make the SSH plugin easy
    to configure.


### 2. Reloading the Apache configuration file

When project services change, it is necessary for the KForge system to
regenerate the KForge Apache configuration file. For these changes to take
effect it is then necessary for Apache to reload its configuration.

There are three options for reloading the Apache configuration file:

1.  Event-driven reloading with KForge

    In the [www] section of the KForge configuration file, set 'reload_apache' to
    the command which will reload the apache configuration on your system.

    NB: In order for this to work the user which owns the Apache process must be
    able to reload the configuration.  Specifically it must be able to run the
    'reload_apache' command specified in the [www] section of the configuration.
    You can normally achieve this by adding something to your /etc/sudoers file:

        Cmnd_Alias APACHE = <insert-apache-reload-command>
        [....]
        <www-user-name> ALL =NOPASSWD: APACHE

2.  Regular time-interval reloading with external tool (e.g. cron)

    Reload the Apache config on a regular basis using some external tool. For
    example the following uses cron to reload Apache config every half an hour:

        # Reload Apache config every half an hour.
        # The apache reload command is for apache2 on Debian
        # and might need to be modified for other systems.
        30 * * * *   /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

3.  Event-driven reloading with external tool (e.g. monit)

    Alternatively you could use some form of monitoring service to only reload when
    KForge rebuilds its Apache configuration file. For example, the following uses
    monit:

        check file ${file-name} with path ${path-to-kforge-generated-apache-config}
          if changed timestamp
            then exec "/etc/init.d/apache2 reload"

### 3. Cronjobs

1.  Backups. Hotcopy KForge model data and project service data.

        # Hotcopy KForge service data every night.
        0 4 * * * source /path/to/kforge/bin/activate; kforge-admin backup PATH

    On an external machine, rsync *both* the installation *and* the hotcopy
    folders. You may also dump raw SQL, just use a suitable database command.

2.  Update the recent changes feeds.

        # Update KForge feed every half an hour.
        0,30 * * * * source /path/to/kforge/bin/activate; kforge-admin updatefeed

    If you never run this command, the 'recent changes' feed will not show.
