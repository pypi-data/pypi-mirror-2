"""
A Plugin to provide wordpress subsystem applications.

## Notes ##

We follow an approach where we install a copy of the wordpress code for every
install.

There might be nicer approaches involving symlinking (see e.g. [1]) or the use
of wordpress mu but these all seem to have problems if the blogs aren't laid
out in some consistent manner.

## Installation ##

1. Install Wordpress 2.0 on your system in a master directory.

2. Setup a mysql database for use by the wordpress services (they will all
share the same db)

3. Edit wp-config-sample.php to correspond to the database you have just set
up. This file will be use as the template for the config file for each of the
KForge wordpress installations created in the future.

4. Add the following configuration section to your kforge config

[wordpress]
# path to your master wordpress installation that will be used as a template
master_path = /path/to/your/wordpress/installation
# shell command to run in order to backup the wordpress db
backup_command = mysqldump --user=<insert-name> --password=<insert-password> <db-name>

5. Enable the wordpress plugin in your KForge installation by creating a
wordpress plugin object in the domain model (see the KForge guide for details).

6. That's it!
