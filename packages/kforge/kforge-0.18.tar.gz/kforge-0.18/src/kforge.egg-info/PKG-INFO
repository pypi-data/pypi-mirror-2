Description: 
        KForge provisions project services on-demand and controls access with a robust, role-based, single sign-on access controller.
        
        Project services include version control systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial, Subversion); project frameworks with mechanisms to plan and track work (e.g. Trac); wikis and mailing lists (e.g. MoinMoin, Mailman); and content management systems and blogs (e.g. Joomla, Wordpress).
        
        KForge provides a complete Web interface for review and administration of project members and services, as well as a fully-developed plugin system so that new kinds of services can be added easily.
