KForge is free and open source project hosting software. KForge integrates a variety of common applications with a flexible and robust project management and access control mechanism.

KForge provisions project services on-demand and controls access with a robust, role-based, single sign-on access controller.

Project services include version control systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial, Subversion); project frameworks with mechanisms to plan and track work (e.g. Trac); wikis and mailing lists (e.g. MoinMoin, Mailman); and content management systems and blogs (e.g. Joomla, Wordpress).
