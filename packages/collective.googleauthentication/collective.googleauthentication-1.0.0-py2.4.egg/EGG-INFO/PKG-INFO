        About GoogleAuthentication
        --------------------------
        
        GA takes care of the user authentication upon Google Docs service, so that the Plone
        application can access the documents stored on Google servers.
        
        To let the Plone application access the documents stored on Google servers, it is necessary
        to complete the authentication procedure for Web applications provided by Google Docs. The
        procedure allows Web applications to authenticate users through their Google accounts. For
        security reasons, the application acquires an authentication token which will later be used
        to dowload or upload documents from Google servers without explicitly providing the user's
        credentials. The Plone user is redirected to a Google page that invites him to insert his
        credentials. Once he logs in with his Google account, the user is asked to authorize the
        Plone application to access his documents. Then, if the user grants access, he is pointed
        again to the Plone site. The URL of the last redirection embeds the authentication token
        which, as mentioned above, allows the Plone application to access the user's documents on
        Google servers for the following requests.
        
        GA inititates the authentication procedure upon Google Docs immediately after the user has
        logged into the Plone application. The procedure will be executed just once, as when the
        Plone application obtains the authentication token, it will store as an attribute,
        google_token, in the user profile.
