Description: hgcampfire
        ==========
        
        ``hgcampfire`` provides a Mercurial hook to notify a `Campfire`_
        chatroom about changesets coming in to a repository.
        
        .. _Campfire: http://campfirenow.com
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add the following to your Mercurial config (in a system, user, or
        repo-level hgrc file), replacing the API key, URL, and room ID::
        
        [campfire]
        api_key = CAMPFIRE_AUTH_TOKEN_FOR_THE_USER_NOTIFICATIONS_WILL_COME_FROM
        url = http://myorg.campfirenow.com
        room = 123456
        
        [hooks]
        changegroup.campfire = python:hgcampfire.notify
        
        These configs can of course be separated into different hgrc files,
        for instance if you want to specify the Campfire data user-wide, but
        apply the actual hook only to certain repositories.
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        You can modify the template ``hgcampfire`` uses for its notification
        by setting the ``template`` config value in the ``[campfire]``
        section. The default value is ``{user} pushed:\n{changesets}``. This
        template has the following context available to it: ``root`` is the
        repository root path, ``user`` is the value of the ``$USER``
        environment variable, and ``changesets`` is the list of changesets
        pushed.
        
        You can also modify the template ``hgcampfire`` uses to report each
        changeset, by setting the ``cset_template`` config value in the
        ``[campfire]`` section. This should be a Mercurial changeset template,
        of the same form you'd pass to --template. The default value is
        ``* "{desc}" by {author}``.
