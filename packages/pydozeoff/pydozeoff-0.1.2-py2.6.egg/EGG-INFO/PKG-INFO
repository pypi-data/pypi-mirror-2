Description: 
        As a Linux user, I don't have access to so called "professional" presentation
        softwares such as Apple Keynote or MS PowerPoint. OpenOffice Impress used to be
        my first choice, but I gave up using it since it's a memory/processor hog for
        medium-sized presentations.
        
        After a little research, I came across a wonderful tool called `S5`_. It was a
        perfect fit, except for the one-big-fat-presentation-html thing and the lack of
        syntax highlighting.
        
        This is what I'm trying to solve with this project.
