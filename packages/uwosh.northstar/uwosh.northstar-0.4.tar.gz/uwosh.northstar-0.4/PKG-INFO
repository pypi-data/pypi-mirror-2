Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This project aims to make editing and creating workflows in Plone easier.
        
        Right now it adds a control panel entry ``Workflow Manager`` where you can access the tool at.
        
        Also, this is strictly for add-on product workflows and content types. The tool can not be used to edit default Plone workflows by design.
        
        It provides all the functionality you need to manipulate workflows TTW easily with an ajax powered interface.
