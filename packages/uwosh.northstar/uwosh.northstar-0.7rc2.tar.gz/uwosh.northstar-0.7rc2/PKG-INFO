Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Our vision for uwosh.northstar is as a complete through-the-web (TTW)
        tool for generating workflow applications, ie. a custom content type
        combined with an assigned custom workflow.
        
        Right now it adds a control panel entry ``Workflow Manager`` where you
        can access the workflow tool. It also adds a ``Workflow App Generator``
        control panel entry where you can generate your workflow app products.
        
        Creating content types is easily done by using Dexterity. The tool will
        simply dump your dexterity content type. If you can not use dexterity,
        the tool also supports using PloneFormGen as your modeling tool in which
        it'll create a corresponding Archetype for the PloneFormGen form you've
        created.
        
        uwosh.northstar is strictly for add-on product workflows and content types.
        By design, the tool cannot be used to edit default Plone workflows.
        
        It provides all the functionality you need to manipulate workflows
        easily through the web, using an AJAX-powered interface and to generate the
        products of the content types and workflows you've created TTW.
        
        
        Tested with
        -----------
        * Firefox
        * Google Chrome
        * Safari
        * Opera

        Installation
        ============
        
        Just add `uwosh.northstar` to your buildout eggs sections and then install the
        "North * " product in the add/remove products control panel. In order for the
        workflow application generator to work, you'll need to also add ZopeSkel,
        PasteScript and Paste to the eggs section in your buildout. Additionally, you'll
        need to activate PloneFormGen or Dexterity in your site.
        
        In older versions of Plone, you might need to add plone.app.jquerytools to your
        zcml section also.

        -------------------
        
        * Sanity check now takes initial state into account and checks if transition

        [vangheem]
        
        * added go to state/transition links for the definitions of the states and
        transitions so it is much easier to go to and from transitions that are
        connected to states and visa versa.
        [vangheem]
        
        * when adding a state from a transitions or a transition from a state, it'll
        automatically set the related values respectively since it'll assume you
        want to activate it for that item.
