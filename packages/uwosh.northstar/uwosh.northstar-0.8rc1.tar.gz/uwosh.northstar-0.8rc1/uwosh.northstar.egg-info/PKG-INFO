Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Our vision for uwosh.northstar is as a complete through-the-web (TTW)
        tool for generating workflow applications, ie. a custom content type
        combined with an assigned custom workflow.
        
        Right now it adds a control panel entry ``Workflow Manager`` where you
        can access the workflow tool. It also adds a ``Workflow App Generator``
        control panel entry where you can generate your workflow app products.
        
        Creating content types is easily done by using Dexterity. The tool will
        simply dump your dexterity content type. If you can not use dexterity,
        the tool also supports using PloneFormGen as your modeling tool in which
        it'll create a corresponding Archetype for the PloneFormGen form you've
        created.
        
        uwosh.northstar is strictly for add-on product workflows and content types.
        By design, the tool cannot be used to edit default Plone workflows.
        
        It provides all the functionality you need to manipulate workflows
        easily through the web, using an AJAX-powered interface and to generate the
        products of the content types and workflows you've created TTW.
        
        
        You can take a look at the new video demonstrating the workflow editor

        Tested with
        -----------
        * Firefox
        * Google Chrome
        * Safari
        * Opera
        * IE8
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just add `uwosh.northstar` to your buildout eggs sections and then install the
        "North * " product in the add/remove products control panel. In order for the
        workflow application generator to work, you'll need to also add ZopeSkel,
        PasteScript and Paste to the eggs section in your buildout. Additionally, you'll
        need to activate PloneFormGen or Dexterity in your site.
        
        In older versions of Plone, you might need to add plone.app.jquerytools to your
        zcml slug section of your buildout also.
        
        
        Graphing
        --------
        
        One feature of North * is that it can create a Diagram of the workflows
        you create TTW.
        
        The inspiration for this piece was pretty much taken from DCWorkflowGraph.
        
        In order to enable this feature, you'll need to install the Graphviz library.

        Produced by Secret Laboratory Number 1 at UW Oshkosh.

        * when adding a state from a transitions or a transition from a state, it'll
