Description: Stellaris is a metadata management service developed within the AstroGrid-D project. Our focus is to provide a flexible way to store and query metadata relevant for e-science and grid-computing. This can range from resource description of grid resources (compute clusters, robotic telescopes, etc.) to application specific job metadata or dataset annotations. We use common web-standards such as RDF to describe metadata and the accompanying query language SPARQL. Some features of the software include:
        
        - A simple but powerful management interface for RDF-graphs
        - Different backends for persistence through the use of RDFLib and Virtuoso
        - Authorization and authentication based on X.509-certificates
        - Supports different ways of VO-based authorization such as VOMRS
        - SPARQL-protocol implementation with both XML/JSON result formats
