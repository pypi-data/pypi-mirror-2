Release Notes - Stellaris - Version 0.3.1 (2008/08/22)

- Minor fix to update setup.py with the correct versions of dependencies

Release Notes - Stellaris - Version 0.3.0 (2008/08/22)

- HTTPS server based on OpenSSL from the python standard library
- Possible to run embedded Stellaris instances using WSGI behind for
  example Apache
- Configuration options for worker-timeout to avoid problems when
  uploading large files
- Fixed REMOTE_USER WSGI environment variable
- Added a first implementation of a javascript-client
- Support for migration of instance environments to new stellaris versions
- Fixed performance issue of the logging
- Fixed version-handling in the RDBMS-backend

Release Notes - Stellaris - Version 0.2.0

- Rewrote the Virtuoso-index to fix problems with removal of data
- Client now has support for both backup and restore 
- Update to latest version of virtuoso (5.0.6) fixes filtering of
  dates.
- Virtuoso is configured and started by stellaris
- Moved to trac for issue-tracking and documentation 
  (http://stellaris.zib.de/trac/)
- Updated documentation on security-model, protocol, etc.

Release Notes - Stellaris - Version 0.2.0c1

- Introduction of a separate stellaris client package (stellaris.client)
- A single installation can support multiple index backends (rdflib,
sesame, virtuoso)
- Graphs are stored in a separate database (i.e. not in the index as earlier)
- Parts of the HTTP Interface has been updated, breaking previous
clients. The old service will therefore be online until there has been
enough time to update the clients.
- The /context/-path is now configurable (e.g. it can be / or /graphs/ etc.)
- Resolving of URIs from the RDF is done by checking parent paths
until a graph is found. RDF-data stored under /jobs/1234 can then
contain paths such as /jobs/1234/config, and still be resolvable. I.e,
a request for /jobs/1234/config ends up at /jobs/1234.
- XML-format for atomically performing multiple operations (append,
remove, update) within a single request.
- Out-of-sync indices can be brought back to a current state using the
graph database. This means that it is possible to plugin new index
types at a later stage
- Client-side support for backup/(restore)
- Note that the ChangeLog is missing releases between 0.1.1 and 0.2.0c1

- Moved to Jira's ChangeLog format.
- Removed dependency on Twisted
- The CherryPy HTTP server + WSGI is used for the frontend
- Installation via setup-tools
- Re-factored into using a view concept, each request is handled by a stack

- Added support for authorization via VOMRS, flat-files and gridmap-files of 
  change requests (POST, PUT and DELETE).

    * [ICE-15] - JSON and XML output handle optional variables incorrect
    * [ICE-16] - synchronisation problem when removing/uploading the same context
    * [ICE-18] - Updating lists remove the old list and the new list
