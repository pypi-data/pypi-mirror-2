Description: # What is BayesOnRedis?
        
        Bayesian classifier on top of Redis
        
        ## Why on Redis?
        
        [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis) is a persistent in-memory database with supports for various data structures such as lists, sets, and ordered sets.
        All this data types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection, difference between sets, and so forth.
        
        Because of Redis properties:
        
        * It is extremely easy to implement simple algorithm such as bayesian filter.
        
        * The persistence of Redis means that the Bayesian implementation can be used in real production environment.
        
        * Even though I don't particularly care about performance at the moment. Redis benchmarks give me confidence that the implementation can scale to relatively large training data.
        
        ## How to install? (Ruby version)
        
        gem install bayes_on_redis
        
        ## Getting started
        
        # Create instance of BayesOnRedis and pass your Redis information.
        # Of course, use real sentences for much better accuracy.
        # Unless if you want to train spam related things.
        bor = BayesOnRedis.new(:redis_host => '127.0.0.1', :redis_port => 6379, :redis_db => 5)
        
        # Teach it
        bor.train "good", "sweet awesome kick-ass cool pretty smart"
        bor.train "bad", "sucks lame boo death bankrupt loser sad"
        
        # Then ask it to classify text.
        bor.classify("awesome kick-ass ninja can still be lame.")
        
        ## for Pythonistas
        
        BayesOnRedis is also available in Python. With the same API.
