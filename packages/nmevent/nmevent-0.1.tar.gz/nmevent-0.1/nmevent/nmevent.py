"""nmevent - C#-like implementation of the Observer pattern

This is a Python module "nmevent", simple C#-like implementation of
the Observer pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).
It's main purpose and goal is to allow developers to use events
with C#-like syntax in their Python classes.
