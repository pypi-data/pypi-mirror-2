"""nmevent - C#-like implementation of the Observer pattern

This is a Python module :mod:`nmevent`, simple C#-like implementation of
the Observer pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).
It's main purpose and goal is to allow developers to use events
with C#-like syntax in their Python classes.

Usage example
=============

The most straightfoward way to use :mod:`nmevent` is this:

>>> import nmevent
>>> class ExampleClass(object):
...    def __init__(self):
...       self.event = nmevent.Event()
...
...    def _do_something(self):
...       self.event(self)
...
>>> example = ExampleClass()
>>> example.event += handler

It should be noted, that event doesn't necessarily need to
be an object attribute. :class:`Event` instance is basically
just a callable object that works as a sort of "dispatch
demultiplexer".

This usage, however, isn't very C#-like. In C#, events are declared
in class scope and that's where the :class:`EventSlot` comes in.
Once you've created event using :class:`EventSlot`, you can
use the same way you use :class:`Event`, only you don't need
to specify the sender when raising the event. That's because
the event is already bound to the instance of the class it has
been declared in.

>>> from nmevent import EventSlot
>>> class ExampleClass(object):
...    event = EventSlot()
...
...    def _do_something(self):
...       self.event()
...
>>> def handler(sender, **keywords):
...    pass
...
>>> example = ExampleClass()
>>> example.event += handler

Perhaps this looks even more straightfoward than instantiating
:class:`Event` in object's constructor, but there's actually
lot more going on under hood this time.

>>> import nmevent
>>> @nmevent.with_events
... class ExampleClass(object):
...    @nmevent.nmproperty
...    def x(self):
...       return self._x
...
>>> example = ExampleClass()
>>> example.x_changed += handler
>>> example.x = 10 # handler gets called

    This is an event descriptor, which means it works
    kind of like the built-in property object. You can
    find more information on descriptors in Python's
    documentation (http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel#customizing-attribute-access),
    or in a number of articles such as Raymond Hettinger's
    how-to (http://users.rcn.com/python/download/Descriptor.htm).
    In short, as the Python documentation puts it, descriptor
    is an object with "binding behavior".

    The rationale for this class is that, unlike the :class:`Event`
    class alone, it alows client to declare events in the class scope.
    The events don't need the ``__init__()`` method to be run in order
    to be instantiated. This is especially helpfull when using inheritance,
    because the inherited class doesn't need to explicitly call base
    class's constructor in order to inherit the events.

    Also, declaring the events in the class scope is more C#-like
    than instantiating them in the constructor.

    Usage:

    >>> class Example(object):
    ...    something_changed = EventSlot()
    ...
    ...    def foo(self):

       of any property, but need to know which one changed.
