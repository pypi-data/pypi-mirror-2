Changelog
=========

1.0b2

 * Emulate Plone 4 form tabbing in Plone 3.x. Probably mainly useful with
   PloneFormGen quick edit mode
   [smcmahon]
 
 * Reproduce the Plone 4 popups as possible.
   [smcmahon]
 
 * Adjust styles to work in IE 6.
   [davisagli]

1.0b1

 * Shifted the division of labor between pipbox and plone.app.jquerytools.
   The overlay support is now in plone.app.jquerytools so that we can use
   it in plonetheme.sunburst. pipbox is now mainly a wrapper aimed at
   making it possible to use the jqt bling without writing any js.

0.3a8

 * Add a "Close" span to close button. It's hidden by the default style sheet.
   This is a temporary fix, since it's not translatable as implemented.

0.3a7

 * Make overlay loading smoother.

0.3a6

 * Add width parameter.
 
 * Tweak default styles.

0.3a5

 * Load jQuery Tools from plone.app.jqtools

0.3a4

 * Append overlays to #visual-portal-wrapper or body -- not the link.

0.3a3
