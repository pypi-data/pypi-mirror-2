        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Galleriffic`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Galleriffic`: http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.galleriffic``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``galleriffic`` from ``js.galleriffic`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.galleriffic import galleriffic
          >>> galleriffic.need()
