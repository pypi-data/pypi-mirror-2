What is pluto?

Pluto is not a planet. Unlike other planet projects, pluto aims to provide an
architecture to manually import articles from other feeds. The imported article
are available as a new feed or for integration into other parts of a Django
project.


==================
How to setup pluto
==================

Pluto has some requirements:

* Django 1.1
* Universal Feed Parser from http://www.feedparser.org/


===========
Using pluto
===========

Pluto has no own interface but uses the Django admin interface. To import a new
article just add a new entry. Usually it is enough to paste the link to the
article.
