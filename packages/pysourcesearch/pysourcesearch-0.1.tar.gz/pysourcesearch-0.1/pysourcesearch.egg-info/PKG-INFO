Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package will allow you to create your own search engines for your packages and sets of packages.
        It's not perfect, but I find it useful. It's really fast and easier to find what you're looking for often.
        
        You can search specifically for methods, classes and filenames or just do a full text search.
        
        It's built on repoze.bfg, repoze.catalog and pygments.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Start off with a virtualenv::
        
        >>> virtualenv pysourcesearch --no-site-packages
        >>> cd pysourcesearch
        >>> ./bin/easy_install pysourcesearch
        >>> ./bin/easy_install PasteScript
        
        
        Then you can use the ini WSGI configuration provided with the package or create your own similar to this::
        
        >>> [app:main]
        >>> use = egg:pysourcesearch#app
        >>> debug_notfound = false
        >>> catalogs_location = %(here)s/catalogs
        >>> reindex = False
        >>> package_groups =
        >>>     Plone:/Applications/Plone/buildout-cache/eggs
        >>> skipped_paths =
        >>>		tests
        >>>
        >>> [server:main]
        >>> use = egg:Paste#http
        >>> host = 0.0.0.0
        >>> port = 6543
        
        Then run::
        
        >>> ./bin/paster serve pysourcesearch.ini
        
        The first time it runs it will take some time to index everything. If you tail the catalog you'll
        be able to see the status of indexing.
        
        >>> tail -f pysourcesearch.log
        
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Here are some of the WSGI configuration options::
        
        * catalogs_location = Location where the indexes are stored
        * reindex = If you want to reindex every time it's run
        * package_groups = a list of locations to egg packages. This is normally a `buildout-cache/eggs` direction or a `lib/python2.6/site-packages` directory
        * skipped_paths = a list of folders that you'd rather not index the contents of
