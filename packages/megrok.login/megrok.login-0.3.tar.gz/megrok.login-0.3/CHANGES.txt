megrok.login changes
********************

0.3 (2010-07-03)
================

* Support for Grok >= 1.1. 

  We now use zope.pluggableauth and friends if available. Note, that
  if you run into problems like non-found authentication adapters, you
  might have to add `zope.app.authentication` manually in your
  project. You can do so by adding::

    <include package="zope.app.authentication" file="configure.zcml"
    />

  in your projects' `configure.zcml`.

  If you use ``includeDependencies`` in your projects'
  ``configure.zcml`` (which is most likely true for all projects based
  on `grokproject`, it should be sufficient to depend on
  `megrok.login` in your project's ``setup.py``, as the
  ``configure.zcml`` of `megrok.login` now includes
  ``zope.app.authentication`` for you.

* Default PAU setup now does not include 'No Challenge if
  Authenticated' authenticator plugin anymore. Using this plugin in a
  pipe of authenicators, already authenticated users that entered a
  still forbidden page got ``Unauthorized`` errors instead of being
  redirected to the login page.

  Note that this new behaviour applies only to applications newly
  created. If you have some older applications setup with an older
  version of `megrok.login`, you have to modify the authenticator
  plugins of your already setup PAU manually, for instance using the
  ZMI.


0.2 (2009-12-09)
================

* Changed utility setup to reflect changes in Grok API: eventually use
  `IUtilitySetup` instead of `grokcore.meta.setupUtility`. Thanks go to
  Simon Jagoe.

* Changed the test configuration to handle the new grok.View permission.

* Added the versions.cfg file from grok.
