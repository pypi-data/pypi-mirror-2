TakeAction, content as actions
------------------------------

Introduction
------------

This is a simple tool that provides specific content as actions. Simply
put the paths in the content_paths field (absolute or relative to the portal),
give the action a category, and use the actions anywhere in your skin.

As an added bonus, translatable content (such as LinguaPlone content), will
automatically result in translated actions pointing at the correct translation.

Installation
------------

Choose the 'takeaction' profile in the portal_setup tool, and import.
