Description: ------------------------------
        TakeAction, content as actions
        ------------------------------
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a simple tool that provides specific content as actions. Simply
        put the paths in the content_paths field (absolute or relative to the portal),
        give the action a category, and use the actions anywhere in your skin.
        
        As an added bonus, translatable content (such as LinguaPlone content), will
        automatically result in translated actions pointing at the correct translation.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Choose the 'takeaction' profile in the portal_setup tool, and import.
