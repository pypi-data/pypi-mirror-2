It is common for django views to require the same import boilerplate
over and over again, with slight variations.  Most of the things I
find I need to import regularly are in djview, so I can get them all
with a single "from djview import *".

I also include several utility functions that I think we all tend to
recreate in one form or another, and a decorator for json views that
handles date formatting and has a custom encode hook.
