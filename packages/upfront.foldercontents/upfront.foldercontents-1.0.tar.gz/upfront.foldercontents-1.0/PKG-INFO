Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        upfront.foldercontents is a folder contents implementation that does not
        depend on the portal_catalog. It adapts IFolderish content to a folder
        implementation that indexes allowedRolesAndUsers directly on the
        container and iterate directly over the objects in the container.
        
        Once you use the foldercontents adapter provided by this package you no
        longer depend on the portal_catalog to list the content of a folder. No
        indexes are removed from the catalog however since it is not the
        responsibility of this package to do so.
        
        Currently it does not support sorting inside a folder and does not have
        an index that is equivalent to getObjectPositionInParent. You are
        encouraged to sublcass and extend the existing adapter if you want this
        functionality.

        =============
        
        So far it has only been tested on Plone 3.x.
