0.1 - 0.2

* Plone 4 compatibility

* Removed global defines special handlers - they were used for Plone 3,
  but Plone 4 is now out solving the problem itself
  
* Added special exception type for the cases viewlet is not found by name.
  It was bad idea to return NotFound as Zope has special meaning for
  this exception (you get 404).
