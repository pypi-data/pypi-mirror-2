Towards a totally accessible Plone
----------------------------------

ItalianSkin (IS) is a product for Plone that aims making Plone compliant to latest Xhtml 1.0 Strict standards, a positive answer to the italian tight law called Legge Stanca, among its main features a useful tool for costumizing your visualization.

Besides assuring whole compliance with the capital principles of italian law on web for public administration (Legge Stanca, 4/2004), ItalianSkin enables a comprehensive safeguard for final user improving the code for an appropriate readability by means such as screen readers (a necessary instrument for blind users) and produces an alternative high-visibility layout thought expressly for partially-sighted people.

Compared to a traditional Plone site, ItalianSkin introduces:

   - Support for a bare Xhtml 1.0 Strict code, valid for the whole portal, as well as for other popular products used by the community (separately to install)
	. tableless layout
	. traditional layout

   - Fitting Plone site pages and popular third part products to W3C's accessibility principles, following requirements established by italian civil law (legge Stanca), avoiding those code instruments that weigh down or make impossible a proper visualization.

    - Dynamic evaluation and correction of non-compliant elements of the code to the Xhtml Stric grammar, eventually mistaken by an inexpert user.


Answering the free software issue about an open source code, ItalianSkin is released under the same licence as Plone.
