Usage of createzopecoverage
===========================

.. :doctest:

createzopecoverage provides a ``createzopecoverage`` script, which has an entry point:

    >>> from createzopecoverage import script
    >>> script.main
    <function main at ...>

The createzopecoverage script looks at sys.argv, so we reset that one first.

    >>> import sys
    >>> original_argv = sys.argv[1:]
    >>> sys.argv[1:] = []

I haven't mocked up a test environment yet, so we get an error about a missing
bin/test file:

    >>> script.main()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: Test command doesn't exist: .../parts/test/bin/test

I set up a temp directory:

    >>> import os
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> currdir = os.getcwd()
    >>> tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    >>> os.chdir(tempdir)
    >>> bindir = os.path.join(tempdir, 'bin')
    >>> os.mkdir(bindir)
    >>> testbinary = os.path.join(bindir, 'test')
    >>> open(testbinary, 'w').write('hello')

And to prevent this test from opening browser windows, we monkey patch the
build-in webbrowser module:

    >>> import webbrowser
    >>> def monkey_open(path):
    ...     print "Opening %s in webbrowser" % path
    >>> original_open = webbrowser.open
    >>> webbrowser.open = monkey_open

And we monkey patch the command runner:

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> original_call = subprocess.call
    >>> def monkey_call(items):
    ...     print "Calling %s" % ' '.join(items)
    ...     if 'bin/test' in items[0]:
    ...         # bin/test creates a coverage dir, normally.
    ...         os.mkdir(os.path.join(tempdir, 'coverage'))
    >>> subprocess.call = monkey_call

Now we're ready for testing:

    >>> script.main()
    Running tests in coverage mode (can take a long time)
    Calling .../bin/test --coverage=.../coverage
    Creating coverage reports...
    Done.
    Opening .../coverage/reports/all.html in webbrowser

After this first run, there's a coverage dir.  A second run will remove it first:

    >>> script.main()
    Removing old coverage dir
    Running tests in coverage mode (can take a long time)
    Calling .../bin/test --coverage=.../coverage
    Creating coverage reports...
    Done.
    Opening .../coverage/reports/all.html in webbrowser

If we pass in a command line argument we treat that as the output directory,
which gets created if it doesn't exist.  We also assume that this will be only
done by buildbot, so we won't open the results in a webbrowser.

    >>> outputdir = os.path.join(tempdir, 'output')
    >>> os.path.exists(outputdir) # Not yet!
    False
    >>> sys.argv[1:] = [outputdir]
    >>> script.main()
    Buildbot mode, output will be placed in .../output
    Removing old coverage dir
    Running tests in coverage mode (can take a long time)
    Calling .../bin/test --coverage=.../coverage
    Creating coverage reports...
    Done.

Test cleanup:

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree(tempdir)
    >>> webbrowser.open = original_open
    >>> subprocess.call = original_call
    >>> sys.argv[1:] = original_argv
    >>> os.chdir(currdir)
