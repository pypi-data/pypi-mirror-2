Description: createzopecoverage
        ==================
        
        createzopecoverage provides a ``bin/createzopecoverage`` script that serves as
        a one-line coverage report generator.  It is essentially a wrapper around
        `z3c.coverage <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.coverage>`_.  It is intended
        for use inside buildouts, so there are two assumptions:
        
        - The directory you run this script from is the root of the buildout.
        
        - There is a ``bin/test``.
        
        And yes, it assumes a z3c.coverage, so a zope test setup.  It doesn't work
        with a "regular" coverage.py setup.
        
        
        Installation and use
        --------------------
        
        To install, add ``createzopecoverage`` to a zc.recipe.egg section.  You often
        already have one for common scripts.  So something like this::
        
          [buildout]
          ...
          parts =
              ...
              console_scripts
        
          [console_scripts]
          recipe = zc.recipe.egg
          eggs =
              ...
              createzopecoverage
        
        This gives you a ``bin/createzopecoverage`` script that does the following:
        
        - Check whether bin/test exists.  Safety feature.
        
        - Remove old coverage dir if it exists.  This way you always have clean
          results.
        
        - Run bin/test with the ``--coverage=...`` option.
        
        - Use z3c.coverage to create the actual reports.  By default into
          ``./coverage/reports``.  If you start createzopecoverage with a command line
          argument (``bin/createzopecoverage /tmp/output``) it will put the reports into
          that directory.
        
        - Open the reports in your webbrowser *if you did not specify an output
          directory*.  The assumption here is that if you run the script as-is, you
          just want to see the coverage reports.  If you *do* specify an output
          directory, you're probably running it from within buildbot or so on the
          server and you want the output in some webserver-served directory.  No use
          to open a browser on the server.

        The source code lives at https://bitbucket.org/reinout/createzopecoverage, you
        can also `report issues
        <https://bitbucket.org/reinout/createzopecoverage/issues>`_ there.  Feel free
        to suggest improvements (and especially to make them yourself).
        
        
        OSX comment
        -----------
        
        z3c.coverage uses the "enscript" command for python code highlighting.  The
        version provided by OSX before 10.5.7 complains about an unkown ``--footer``
        argument passed by z3c.coverage.  There are two possible solutions:
        
        - Update to 10.5.7.  That update came out a few minutes after I wrote this
          original comment :-)
        
        - Install enscript from macports.
        
        - Add a script called "enscript" on your path that calls the original enscript
          minus the offending argument::
        
            #!/bin/sh
            shift
            /usr/bin/enscript -q --header -h --language=html --color -o - $9
