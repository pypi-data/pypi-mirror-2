			Python classes that extend the 
		Functionality of 'netsnmp' Extension Module

### Main Features
(1) BULKWALK : Current implementation of netsnmp  does not provide
a 'bulkwalk' method . The existing 'snmpwalk' implementation uses 
single 'getnext' operations that take a long time to complete in a 
device with several interfaces. However 'python' snmp provides a 
class to do this, by extending the getbulk method in 'netsnmp 
extension module'
(2) BULKWALKMULTI : A multithreaded interface to run concurrent 
'bulkwalk' on several devices at once. This is still in progress 


### Introduction:
pythonsnmp module currently provides classes that add functionality
to net-snmp's python bindings. To use these classes you need to have
net-snmp installed along with python bindings. Please review the LICENSE
for both, that are available from their respective websites.
