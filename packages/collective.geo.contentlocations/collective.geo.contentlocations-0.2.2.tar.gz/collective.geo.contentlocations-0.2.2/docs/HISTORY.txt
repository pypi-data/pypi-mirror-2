* Manage coordinates form now redirects to the the View action for
  certain types of content specified in the site properties.  This 
  includes types such as File and Image where redirecting to their normal
  absolute URL would prompt the user to download said content.

  settings.

  changes in collective.geo.kml. The manage coordinates form now

  with WGS 1984 reference system.  This involves standardising the
