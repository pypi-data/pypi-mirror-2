        Intended audience
        =================
        
        This component is clearly dedicated to Zope developers and integrators. This

        ==========
        
        ``aws.zope2zcmldoc`` has been tested with Zope 2.10, Zope 2.11, and Zope
        2.12. It may or may not work with earlier or later versions of Zope.
        
        Please consider
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        With ``zc.buildout`` and ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``, you just need to add
        this in your ``buildout.cfg`` file ::
        
        ...
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        aws.zope2zcmldoc
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        aws.zope2zcmldoc
        ...
        
        Start your Zope instance, open a browser in your Zope root as Manager and type
        in your address bar: http://<your-zope-root>/@@install-aws-zope2zcmldoc
        
        Now go to the Zope Control Panel and learn the various ZCML namespaces, elements
        and attributes.
        
        Uninstallation
        ==============
        
        Before removing the ``aws.zope2zcmldoc`` from your ``buildout.cfg`` and
        rebuilding your instance, you may want to remove the control panel entry.
        
        Removing the Control Panel entry is not essential, but if you don't do this, a
        slate entry will be left in the Zope Control Panel of your Zope instance.
        
        Start your Zope instance, open a browser in your Zope root as Manager and type
        in your address bar: http://<your-zope-root>/@@uninstall-aws-zope2zcmldoc
