        ================
        
         * Include required files in distribution [Łukasz Nowak]
        
        0.1 (2011-05-27)
        ================
        
         * Merged slapos.slap, slapos.tool.console, slapos.tool.format,
           slapos.tool.grid, slapos.tool.libnetworkcache and slapos.tool.proxy into one

        ======
        
        slapformat is an application to prepare SlapOS ready node (machine).
        
        It "formats" the machine by:
        
         - creating users and groups
         - creating bridge interface
         - creating needed tap interfaces
         - creating needed directories with proper ownership and permissions
        
        In the end special report is generated and information are posted to
        configured SlapOS server.
        
        This program shall be only run by root.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Linux with IPv6, bridging and tap interface support.
        
        Binaries:
        
         * brctl
         * groupadd
         * ip
         * tunctl
         * useradd

        slapgrid is a client of SLAPos. SLAPos provides support for deploying a SaaS
        system in a minute.
        Slapgrid allows you to easily deploy instances of softwares based on buildout
        profiles.
        For more informations about SLAP and SLAPos, please see the SLAP documentation.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        A working SLAP server with informations about your computer, in order to
        retrieve them.
        
        As Vifib servers use IPv6 only, we strongly recommend an IPv6 enabled UNIX
        box.
        
        For the same reasons, Python >= 2.6 with development headers is also strongly
        recommended (IPv6 support is not complete in previous releases).
        
        For now, gcc and glibc development headers are required to build most software
        releases.
        
        
        Concepts
        --------
        
        Here are the fundamental concepts of slapgrid : 
        A Software Release (SR) is just a software.
        A Computer Partition (CP) is an instance of a Software Release.
        Imagine you want to install with slapgrid some software and run it. You will
        have to install the software as a Software Release, and then instantiate it,
        i.e configuring it for your needs, as a Computer Partition.
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        When run, slapgrid will authenticate to the SLAP library with a computer_id and
        fetch the list of Software Releases to install or remove and Computer
        Partitions to start or stop.
        Then, it will process each Software Release, and each Computer Partition.
        It will also periodically send to SLAP the usage report of each Computer
        Partition.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        With easy_install::
        
          $ easy_install slapgrid
        
        slapgrid needs several directories to be created and configured before being
        able to run : a software releases directory, and an instances directory with
        configured computer partition directory(ies).
        You should create for each Computer Partition directory created a specific user
        and associate it with its Computer Partition directory. Each Computer Partition
        directory should belongs to this specific user, with permissions of 0750.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        slapgrid needs several informations in order to run. You can specify them by
        adding arguments to the slapgrid command line, or by putting then in a
        configuration file.
        Beware : you need a valid computer resource on server side.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        simple example : 
        Just run slapgrid:
        
          $ slapgrid --instance-root /path/to/instance/root --software-root
          /path/to/software_root --master-url https://some.server/some.resource
          --computer-id my.computer.id
        
        
        configuration file example::
        
          [slapgrid]
          instance_root = /path/to/instance/root
          software_root = /path/to/software/root
          master_url = https://slapos.server/slap_service
          computer_id = my.computer.id
        
        then run slapgrid::
        
          $ slapgrid --configuration-file = path/to/configuration/file
        
        
        
        libnetworkcache
        ===============
        The goal of libnetworkcache python library is to abstract the REST calls.
        It works as wrapper of python httplib to use the Networkcache HTTP Server.
        
        API
        ---
        So, it must provide 2 methods:
        
         put(file)
         ''' Upload the file to Networkcache HTTP Server using PUT as HTTP method.'''
        
         get(key)
         ''' Download the file from Networkcache HTTP Server using GET as HTTP method.''' 
        
        
        proxy

        Simple Language for Accounting and Provisioning python library.
        
        Developer note - python version
        -------------------------------
        
        This library is used on client (slapgrid) and server side.
        Server is using python2.4 and client is using python2.6
        Having this in mind, code of this library *have* to work
        on python2.4
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        The SLAP main server which is in charge of service coordination receives from participating servers the number of computer paritions which are available, the type of resource which a party is ready provide, and request from parties for resources which are needed.
        
        Each participating server is identified by a unique ID and runs a slap-server daemon. This dameon collects from the main server the installation tasks and does the installation of resources, then notifies the main server of completion whenever a resource is configured, installed and available.
        
        The data structure on the main server is the following:
        
        A - Action: an action which can happen to provide a resource or account its usage
        CP - Computer Partition: provides a URL to Access a Cloud Resource
        RI - Resource Item: describes a resource
        CI - Contract Item: describes the contract to attach the DL to (This is unclear still)
        R - Resource: describes a type of cloud resource (ex. MySQL Table) is published on slapgrid.org
        DL - Delivery Line: Describes an action happening on a resource item on a computer partition
        D - Delivery: groups multiple Delivery Lines
