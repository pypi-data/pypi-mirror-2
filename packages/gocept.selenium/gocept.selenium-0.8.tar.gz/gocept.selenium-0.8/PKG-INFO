Description: Selenium RC integration with zope.testing
        =========================================
        
        gocept.selenium integrates Selenium RC with your Plone/Zope 2/ZTK test suite.
        
        
        Quick start with ZTK
        --------------------
        
        Assuming that you already have a package that uses zc.buildout and
        zope.testing, you need to do this to enable Selenium tests:
        
        1. Add gocept.selenium to the list of eggs either in your setup.py, or in
           buildout.cfg
        
        2. Install Selenium RC by some means, e.g. by downloading a version from
            <http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-remote-control/>.
        
        3. Run buildout to install gocept.selenium and selenium (the Python bindings
           for Selenium RC).
        
        4. Create a layer for your tests, like this::
        
            import gocept.selenium.ztk
            import zope.app.testing.functional
            zcml_layer = zope.app.testing.functional.ZCMLLayer(
                'ftesting.zcml',
                __name__, __name__, allow_teardown=True)
            selenium_layer = gocept.selenium.ztk.Layer(zcml_layer)
        
          Essentially, the ``zcml_layer`` is what you would use for typical ZTK
          functional tests, and then you wrap it to create ``selenium_layer``.
        
        5. Start writing tests that inherit ``gocept.selenium.ztk.TestCase``; make
           sure you set the ``layer`` attribute to ``selenium_layer`` on each test
           class.
        
        6. In your tests, use ``self.selenium`` to control Selenium RC, e.g. ::
        
            class MyTest(gocept.selenium.ztk.TestCase):
        
                layer = selenium_layer
        
                def test(self):
                    self.selenium.open('http://%s/foo.html' % self.selenium.server)
                    self.selenium.assertBodyText('foo')
        
        7. Run seleniumrc: java -jar /path/to/selenium-server.jar
        
        8. Run bin/test and see it work!
        
        
        Quick start with Zope 2/Plone
        -----------------------------
        
        Essentially the same, only use gocept.selenium.zope2 or gocept.selenium.plone
        instead of gocept.selenium.ztk.
        
        
        Similar packages

        zc.selenium -- integrates Selenium Core with zope.testing.

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.8 (2010-10-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed tests for the StaticFilesLayer to pass with Python 2.4 through 2.7.
        - API expandsion: ``getSelectOptions``
        
        
        0.7 (2010-08-16)
        ----------------
        
        - API expansion: ``getElementHeight|Width``, ``getCookie*`` and a few others.
        - lots of action methods (``mouse*`` among others)
        
        
        0.6 (2010-08-09)
        ----------------
        
        - assertXpathCount now also takes ints (#7681).
        
        - API expansion: add ``isChecked`` to verify checkboxes, ``runScript``,
          ``clickAt``, ``getLocation``, ``getSelectedValue``, ``getSelectedIndex``.
        
        - The ``pause`` method uses float division now. Pauses where implicitly rounded
          to full seconds before when an int was passed.
        
        - The name of the factored test layer contains the module of the bases now. The
          name is used by zope.testrunner distinguish layers. Before this fix selenium
          layers factored from base layers with the same names but in different modules
          would be considered equal by zope.testrunner.
        
        - The factored ZTK layer cleanly shuts down the http server in tearDown now.
          This allows to run different selenium layers in one go.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-08-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a static files test layer for running selenium tests against a set
          of static (HTML) files.
        - Patterns now also work with multiline strings,
          i. e. 'foo*' will match 'foo\nbar' (#7790).
        
        
        0.4.2 (2010-05-20)
        ------------------
        
        - API expansion: ``*keyDown``, ``*keyUp``, ``keyPress``.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2010-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - API expansion: added ``getSelectedLabel``.
        
        - Ignore the code of a server's response when calling `open`. The default
          behaviour of SeleniumRC changed between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 but we want the old
          behaviour by default.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-03-30)
        ----------------
        
        - API expansion: add ``getLocation`` to retrieve currently loaded URL in
          browser.
        
        - API expansion: added ``waitForPopUp``, ``selectPopUp``, ``deselectPopUp``
          and ``close``.
        
        - API expansion: added ``verifyAlertPresent``, ``verifyAlertNotPresent`` and
          ``waitForAlertPresent``.
        
        - Usability: raise a better readable exception when an unimplemented selenese
          method is called.
        
        - Usability: raise failure exceptions that convey the name of the failed
          assertion in spite of some lambdas wrapped around it.
        
        
        0.3 (2010-01-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Extracted 'host' and 'port' as class attributes of gocept.selenium.ztk.Layer
          so subclasses can override them; stopped hardcoding 8087 as the server port.
        
        
        0.2.1 (2009-12-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix incomplete sdist release on PyPI.
        
        
        0.2 (2009-12-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Make Zope 2 test server reachable from the outside.
        - Implemented getTitle/assertTitle/waitForTitle/etc.
        
        
        0.1 (2009-11-08)
        ----------------
        
        - first release
