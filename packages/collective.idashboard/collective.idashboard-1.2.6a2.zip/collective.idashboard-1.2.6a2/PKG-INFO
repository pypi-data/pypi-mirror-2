Description: Introduction
        ============
        Pimp your Plone dashboard!
        
        This is a Plone Product that makes your users' Plone dashboard behave similarly to the iGoogle dashboard.
        
        Specifically, it adds the following functionality:
        - Drag and drop portlets within and between rows
        - Ajax enabled inline portlet editing and saving
        - Ajax removal/deletion of portlets with themable confirmation modal dialog.
        - Toggle show/hide portlets
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.js.jquery
        * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.js.jqueryui
        * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.alerts
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Add 'slc.idashboard' egg to the [instance] part in your buildout configure::
        
        eggs =
        collective.idashboard
        
        
        Upgrading from <=1.2.2:
        =============================
        
        From version 1.2.3 onwards, overrides.zcml is no longer used, so make sure you
        *remove* the following from the 'zcml' subsection in your [instance] section::
        
        zcml =
        collective.idashboard
        collective.idashboard-overrides
        
        Make sure that you run the import step in the Plone Control Panel. Just click
        on the button next to 'Upgrade:'. Drag and drop will not be enabled if you forget to do this.
