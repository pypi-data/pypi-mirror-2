Everjoke
========

Everjoke manages a joke database.

Alpha Testing
------------

Install Everjoke with the command "sudo easy_install everjoke".

Run Everjoke with the command "everjoke" or "everjoke --help".

Report any bugs or feature requests to me directly: cody dot hess at
gmail dot com.

Project source will *soon* be available on GitHub.

Operating System
----------------

Everjoke builds a local working directory to store journal files,
currently this directory is only specified on OS X at
~/Library/Application Support/Everjoke/.  As we polish the software
we'll choose default locations for Linux and Windows directories.
