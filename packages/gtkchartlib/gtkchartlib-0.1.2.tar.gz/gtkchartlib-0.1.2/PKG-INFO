Description: Collection of GTK+ chart widgets
        --------------------------------
        
        Provides some nice GTK+ chart widgets.  Requires PyGTK_ 2.12 or higher.
        
        At this time, provides just a single widget.  More may come as I scratch
        other itches, or as others scratch their own itches and send patches.
        
        ``gtkchartlib.RingChart``
          Visualise hierarchical data in concentric circles.
        
        This project was previously named "pygtkchart".  The name was changed
        after a project of similar name and purpose was encountered elsewhere.
