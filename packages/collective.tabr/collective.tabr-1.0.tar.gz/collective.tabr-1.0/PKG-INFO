Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.tabr allows for easy editing of "tabbed content" using the `jQuery
        Tools Tabs`_ UI tool.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add collective.tabr to your buildout. It uses the z3c.autoinclude plugin so you
        do not need to add it to the ``zcml=`` section of your buildout.
        
        Install via the Add-on Products control panel like you would any other Product.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Tabs are created by selecting "Tab" from the style menu of your editor. This
        will cause everything after the "Tab" element to be a part of that tab's pane
        until another Tab, Default Tab, or "Pane Break" is reached. For example::
        
          <h2 class="content-tab">First Tab</h2>
          <p>This is a paragraph inside the first tab</p>
          
          <h2 class="default-content-tab">Second Tab</h2>
          <p>This is a paragraph inside the second tab</p>
          <p>This tab will be shown first</p>
          
          <hr class="pane-break" />
          
          <p>This paragraph is not inside of a tab</p>
          
          <h2 class="content-tab">First Tab part 2</h2>
          <p>This paragraph will be in the first tab of the second grouping of tabs</p>
          
        This will result in two groups of tabs, the first of which will contain two tabs
        of which the second will be pre-selected when the page loads. The second tab
        group will only have a single tab in it, and it will be preceded by a paragraph
        between itself and the end of the previous tab group.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This package depends on the `jQuery Tools`_ library which is provided by
        `plone.app.jquerytools`_. It does not depend on a specific version of either
        jQuery Tools or jQuery, but you should check to make sure that another package
        is not including multiple versions of any library in use, though this is not
        common.
