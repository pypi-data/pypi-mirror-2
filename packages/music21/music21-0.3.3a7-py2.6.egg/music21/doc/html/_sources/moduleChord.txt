.. module:: music21.chord

This module defines the Chord object, a sub-class of :class:`~music21.note.GeneralNote` as well as other methods, functions, and objects related to chords.

Inherits from: :class:`~music21.note.NotRest`, :class:`~music21.note.GeneralNote`, :class:`~music21.base.Music21Object`, :class:`~music21.base.JSONSerializer`

.. class:: Chord(notes=[], **keywords)

    Class for dealing with chords A Chord functions like a Note object but has multiple pitches. Create chords by passing a string of pitch names 

    >>> from music21 import *
    >>> dmaj = chord.Chord(["D","F#","A"])

    
    Or you can combine already created Notes or Pitches: 

    
    >>> C = note.Note()
    >>> C.name = 'C'
    >>> E = note.Note()
    >>> E.name = 'E'
    >>> G = note.Note()
    >>> G.name = 'G'

    
    And then create a chord with note objects: 

    
    >>> cmaj = chord.Chord([C, E, G])

    
    Chord has the ability to determine the root of a chord, as well as the bass note of a chord. 
    In addition, Chord is capable of determining what type of chord a particular chord is, whether 
    it is a triad or a seventh, major or minor, etc, as well as what inversion the chord is in. 
    NOTE: For now, the examples used in documentation give chords made from notes that are not 
    defined. In the future, it may be possible to define a chord without first creating notes, 
    but for now note that notes that appear in chords are simply shorthand instead of creating notes 
    for use in examples

            >>> a = chord.Chord(['a', 'c', 'e'])
            >>> a.quality
            'minor' 
            Inversions don't matter. 
            >>> a = chord.Chord(['f', 'b', 'd', 'g'])
            >>> a.quality
            'major' 
            >>> a = chord.Chord(['c', 'a-', 'e'])
            >>> a.quality
            'augmented' 
            >>> a = chord.Chord(['c','c#','d'])
            >>> a.quality
            'other' 

            

        .. attribute:: scaleDegrees

            returns a list of two-element tuples for each pitch in the chord where the first element of the tuple is the scale degree as an int and the second is an Accidental object that specifies the alteration from the scale degree (could be None if the note is a part of the scale) 

            It is easiest to see the utility of this method using a chord subclass, :class:`music21.roman.RomanNumeral`, but it is also callable from this Chord object if the Chord has a Key or Scale context set for it. 

            

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> k = key.Key('f#')  # 3-sharps minor
            >>> rn = roman.RomanNumeral('V', k)
            >>> rn.pitches
            [C#5, E#5, G#5] 
            >>> rn.scaleDegrees
            [(5, None), (7, <accidental sharp>), (2, None)] 
            >>> rn2 = roman.RomanNumeral('N6', k)
            >>> rn2.pitches
            [B4, D5, G5] 
            >>> rn2.scaleDegrees # N.B. -- natural form used for minor!
            [(4, None), (6, None), (2, <accidental flat>)] 

            
            As mentioned above, the property can also get its scale from context if 
            the chord is embedded in a Stream.  Let's great the same V in f#-minor 
            again, but give it a context of c-sharp minor, and then c-minor instead: 

            
            >>> chord1 = chord.Chord(["C#5", "E#5", "G#5"])
            >>> st1 = stream.Stream()
            >>> st1.append(key.Key('c#'))   # c-sharp minor
            >>> st1.append(chord1)
            >>> chord1.scaleDegrees
            [(1, None), (3, <accidental sharp>), (5, None)] 

            
            >>> st2 = stream.Stream()
            >>> st2.append(key.Key('c'))    # c minor
            >>> st2.append(chord1)          # same pitches as before
            >>> chord1.scaleDegrees
            [(1, <accidental sharp>), (3, <accidental double-sharp>), (5, <accidental sharp>)] 

            
            >>> st3 = stream.Stream()
            >>> st3.append(key.Key('C'))    # C major
            >>> chord2 = chord.Chord(["C4","C#4","D4","E-4","E4","F4"])  # 1st 1/2 of chromatic
            >>> st3.append(chord2)
            >>> chord2.scaleDegrees
            [(1, None), (1, <accidental sharp>), (2, None), (3, <accidental flat>), (3, None), (4, None)]

        .. method:: closedPosition(forceOctave=None, inPlace=False)

            Returns a new Chord object with the same pitch classes, but now in closed position. If `forcedOctave` is provided, the bass of the chord will be shifted to that provided octave. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> chord1 = chord.Chord(["C#4", "G5", "E6"])
            >>> chord2 = chord1.closedPosition()

        .. method:: containsSeventh()

            returns True if the chord contains at least one of each of Third, Fifth, and Seventh. raises an exception if the Root can't be determined 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cchord = chord.Chord(['C', 'E', 'G', 'B'])
            >>> other = chord.Chord(['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'B'])

            True 

        .. method:: containsTriad()

            returns True or False if there is no triad above the root. "Contains vs. Is": A dominant-seventh chord contains a triad. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cchord = chord.Chord(['C', 'E', 'G'])
            >>> other = chord.Chord(['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
            >>> cchord.containsTriad() #returns True
            True 
            >>> other.containsTriad() #returns True
            True 

        .. method:: fifth(testRoot=None)

            shortcut for scaleX(5) 

        .. method:: findBass()

            Returns the lowest note in the chord The only time findBass should be called is by bass() when it is figuring out what the bass note of the chord is. Generally call bass() instead example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cmaj = chord.Chord(['C4', 'E3', 'G4'])
            >>> cmaj.findBass() # returns E3
            E3 

        .. method:: findRoot()

            Looks for the root by finding the note with the most 3rds above it Generally use root() instead, since if a chord doesn't know its root, root() will run findRoot() automatically. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cmaj = chord.Chord(['E', 'G', 'C'])
            >>> cmaj.findRoot() # returns C
            C 

        .. method:: hasAnyRepeatedScale(testRoot=None)

            Returns True if for any scale degree there are two or more different notes (such as E and E-) in the chord. If there are no repeated scale degrees, return false. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cchord = chord.Chord (['C', 'E', 'E-', 'G'])
            >>> other = chord.Chord (['C', 'E', 'F-', 'G'])
            >>> cchord.hasAnyRepeatedScale()
            True 
            >>> other.hasAnyRepeatedScale() # returns false (chromatically identical notes of different scale degrees do not count.
            False 

        .. method:: hasFifth(testRoot=None)

            Shortcut for hasScaleX(5) 

        .. method:: hasRepeatedScaleX(scaleDeg, testRoot=None)

            Returns True if scaleDeg above testRoot (or self.root()) has two or more different notes (such as E and E-) in it.  Otherwise returns false. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cchord = chord.Chord (['C', 'E', 'E-', 'G'])
            >>> cchord.hasRepeatedScaleX(3) # returns true
            True 

        .. method:: hasScaleX(scaleDegree, testRoot=None)

            Each of these returns the number of semitones (mod12) above the root that the third, fifth, etc., of the chord lies, if there exists one.  Or False if it does not exist. You can optionally specify a note.Note object to try as the root.  It does not change the Chord.root object.  We use these methods to figure out what the root of the triad is. Currently there is a bug that in the case of a triply diminished third (e.g., "c" => "e----"), this function will incorrectly claim no third exists.  Perhaps this be construed as a feature. In the case of chords such as C, E-, E, hasThird will return 3, not 4, nor a list object (3,4).  You probably do not want to be using tonal chord manipulation functions on chords such as these anyway. note.Note that in Chord, we're using "Scale" to mean a diatonic scale step. It will not tell you if a chord has a specific scale degree in another scale system.  That functionality might be added to scale.py someday. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cchord = chord.Chord(['C', 'E', 'E-', 'G'])
            >>> cchord.hasScaleX(3) #
            4 
            >>> cchord.hasScaleX(5) # will return 7
            7 
            >>> cchord.hasScaleX(6) # will return False
            False 
            >>> achord = chord.Chord(['a', 'c', 'e#7'])
            >>> achord.hasScaleX(3)
            3 
            >>> achord.hasScaleX(5)
            8 
            >>> achord.hasScaleX(2) # will return False
            False 

            

            

        .. method:: hasSeventh(testRoot=None)

            Shortcut for hasScaleX(7) 

        .. method:: hasSpecificX(scaleDegree, testRoot=None)

            Exactly like hasScaleX, except it returns the interval itself instead of the number of semitones. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cmaj = chord.Chord(['C', 'E', 'G'])
            >>> cmaj.hasSpecificX(3) #will return the interval between C and E
            <music21.interval.Interval M3> 
            >>> cmaj.hasSpecificX(5) #will return the interval between C and G
            <music21.interval.Interval P5> 
            >>> cmaj.hasSpecificX(6) #will return False
            False 

        .. method:: hasThird(testRoot=None)

            Shortcut for hasScaleX(3) 

        .. method:: inversion()

            returns an integer representing which standard inversion the chord is in. Chord does not have to be complete, but determines the inversion by looking at the relationship of the bass note to the root. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> a = chord.Chord(['g', 'b', 'd', 'f'])
            >>> a.inversion()
            2 

        .. method:: inversionName()

            Returns an integer representing the common abbreviation for the inversion the chord is in. If chord is not in a common inversion, returns None. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> a = chord.Chord(['G3', 'B3', 'F3', 'D3'])
            >>> a.inversionName()
            43 

        .. method:: isAugmentedTriad()

            Returns True if chord is an Augmented Triad, that is, if it contains only notes that are either in unison with the root, a major third above the root, or an augmented fifth above the root. Additionally, must contain at least one of each third and fifth above the root. Chord might NOT seem to have to be spelled correctly because incorrectly spelled Augmented Triads are usually augmented triads in some other inversion (e.g. C-E-Ab is a 2nd inversion aug triad; C-Fb-Ab is 1st inversion).  However, B#-Fb-Ab does return false as expeccted). Returns false if is not an augmented triad. 

            >>> import music21.chord
            >>> c = music21.chord.Chord(["C4", "E4", "G#4"])

        .. method:: root(newroot=False)

            Returns or sets the Root of the chord.  if not set, will run findRoot (q.v.) example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cmaj = chord.Chord(['C', 'E', 'G'])
            >>> cmaj.root() # returns C
            C 

        .. method:: scaleX(scaleDegree, testRoot=None)

            Exactly like hasScaleX, except it returns the (first) pitch at the provided scaleDegree instead of the number of semitones. example: 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cmaj = chord.Chord(['C','E','G#'])
            >>> cmaj.scaleX(3) # will return the third of the chord
            E 
            >>> gis = cmaj.scaleX(5) # will return the fifth of the chord
            >>> gis.name
            'G#' 
            >>> cmaj.scaleX(6)
            False 

        .. method:: seekChordTablesAddress()

            Utility method to return the address to the chord table. Table addresses are TN based three character codes: cardinaltiy, Forte index number, inversion Inversion is either 0 (for symmetrical) or -1/1 NOTE: time consuming, and only should be run when necessary. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c3'])
            >>> c1.orderedPitchClasses
            [0] 
            >>> c1.seekChordTablesAddress()
            (1, 1, 0) 
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c', 'c#', 'd', 'd#', 'e', 'f', 'f#', 'g', 'g#', 'a', 'b'])
            >>> c1.seekChordTablesAddress()
            (11, 1, 0) 
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c', 'e', 'g'])
            >>> c1.seekChordTablesAddress()
            (3, 11, -1) 
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c', 'e-', 'g'])
            >>> c1.seekChordTablesAddress()
            (3, 11, 1) 
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c', 'c#', 'd#', 'e', 'f#', 'g#', 'a#'])
            >>> c1.seekChordTablesAddress()
            (7, 34, 0) 
            >>> c1 = chord.Chord(['c', 'c#', 'd'])
            >>> c1.seekChordTablesAddress()
            (3, 1, 0) 

        .. method:: semiClosedPosition()

            TODO: Write moves everything within an octave EXCEPT if there's already a pitch at that step, then it puts it up an octave.  It's a very useful display standard for dense post-tonal chords. 

        .. method:: seventh(testRoot=None)

            shortcut for scaleX(7) 

        .. method:: sortAscending(inPlace=False)

            No documentation. 

        .. method:: sortChromaticAscending()

            Same as sortAscending but notes are sorted by midi number, so F## sorts above G-. 

        .. method:: sortDiatonicAscending(inPlace=False)

            The notes are sorted by Scale degree and then by Offset (so F## sorts below G-). Notes that are the identical pitch retain their order After talking with Daniel Jackson, let's try to make the chord object as immutable as possible, so we return a new Chord object with the notes arranged from lowest to highest 

            

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> cMajUnsorted = chord.Chord(['E4', 'C4', 'G4'])
            >>> cMajSorted = cMajUnsorted.sortDiatonicAscending()
            >>> cMajSorted.pitches[0].name
            'C' 
            >>> c2 = chord.Chord(['E4', 'C4', 'G4'])
            >>> junk = c2.sortDiatonicAscending(inPlace=True)
            >>> c2
            <music21.chord.Chord C4 E4 G4> 

        .. method:: sortFrequencyAscending()

            Same as above, but uses a note's frequency to determine height; so that C# would be below D- in 1/4-comma meantone, equal in equal temperament, but below it in (most) just intonation types. 

        .. method:: third(testRoot=None)

            shortcut for scaleX(3) 

        .. method:: transpose(value, inPlace=False)

            Transpose the Note by the user-provided value. If the value is an integer, the transposition is treated in half steps. If the value is a string, any Interval string specification can be provided. 

            >>> from music21 import *
            >>> a = chord.Chord(['g4', 'a3', 'c#6'])
            >>> b = a.transpose('m3')
            >>> b
            <music21.chord.Chord B-4 C4 E6> 
            >>> aInterval = interval.Interval(-6)
            >>> b = a.transpose(aInterval)
            >>> b
            <music21.chord.Chord C#4 D#3 F##5> 
            >>> a.transpose(aInterval, inPlace=True)
            >>> a
            <music21.chord.Chord C#4 D#3 F##5>
