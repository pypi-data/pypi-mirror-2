Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This Python module aims to provide a Python interface to the VMware vSphere
        Web Services SDK.
        
        By using this module, one can perform all operations on a vSphere server such
        as:
            * Query host systems, datastores and virtual machines
            * Provision new virtual machines
        
        This is a working but very incomplete version of psphere. You should follow
        the latest development efforts at http://bitbucket.org/jkinred/psphere2 for
        more complete (but potentially broken) bindings.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        psphere is best installed using the official package:
        
        $ pip install psphere
        
        This will fetch psphere and it's dependencies from PyPI.
