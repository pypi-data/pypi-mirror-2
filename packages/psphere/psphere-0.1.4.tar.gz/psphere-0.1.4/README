Introduction
------------

This Python module aims to provide a Python interface to the VMware vSphere
Web Services SDK.

By using this module, one can perform all operations on a vSphere server such
as:
    * Query host systems, datastores and virtual machines
    * Provision new virtual machines

This is a working but very incomplete version of psphere. You should follow
the latest development efforts at http://bitbucket.org/jkinred/psphere2 for
more complete (but potentially broken) bindings.

Installation
------------

psphere is best installed using the official package:

$ pip install psphere

This will fetch psphere and it's dependencies from PyPI.
