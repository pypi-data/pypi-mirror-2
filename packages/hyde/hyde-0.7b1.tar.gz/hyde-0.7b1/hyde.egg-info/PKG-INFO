        # A brand new **hyde**
        
        This is the new version of hyde under active development. Incomplete documentation
        can be found [here][hydedocs]. [This][hyde1-0] should give a good understanding of
        the motivation behind this version. You can also take a look at the
        [documentation source][docs] for a reference implementation.

        [Here](http://groups.google.com/group/hyde-dev/browse_thread/thread/2a143bd2081b3322) is
        the initial announcement of the project.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To get the latest released version:
        
            pip install hyde
        
        For the current trunk:
        
            pip install -e git://github.com/hyde/hyde.git#egg=hyde
        
        ## Creating a new hyde site
        
        The following command:
        
                hyde -s ~/test_site create -l doc
        
        will create a new hyde site using the test layout.
        
        ## Generating the hyde site
        
                cd ~/test_site
                hyde gen
        
        ## Serving the website
        
                cd ~/test_site
                hyde serve
                open http://localhost:8080
        
        
        The server also regenerates on demand. As long as the server is running,
        you can make changes to your source and refresh the browser to view the changes.
        
        
        ## Examples
        
        1. [Cloudpanic](https://github.com/tipiirai/cloudpanic)
        2. [Ringce](https://github.com/lakshmivyas/ringce/tree/v3.0)
        
        ## A brief list of features
        
        
        1. Support for multiple templates (although only `Jinja2` is currently implemented)
        2. The different processor modules in the previous version are now
           replaced by a plugin object. This allows plugins to listen to events that
           occur during different times in the lifecycle and respond accordingly.
        3. Metadata: Hyde now supports hierarchical metadata. You can specify and override
           variables at the site, node or the page level and access them in the templates.
        4. Sorting: The sorter plugin provides rich sorting options that extend the
           object model.
        5. Syntactic Sugar: Because of the richness of the plugin infrastructure, hyde can
           now provide additional syntactic sugar to make the content more readable. See
           `blockdown` and `autoextend` plugin for examples.
        
        ## Next Steps
        
        1. Documentation
        2. Default Layouts
        3. Django Support
        4. Plugins:
            * Tags
            * Atom / RSS
            * Text Compressor (CSS, JS, HTML)
            * Image optimizer
