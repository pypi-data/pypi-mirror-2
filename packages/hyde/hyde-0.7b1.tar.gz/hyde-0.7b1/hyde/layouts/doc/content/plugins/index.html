§§ blurb

Hyde is built with a nuclear engine that is stripped down but powerful.
Even core features like `metadata` are added as plugins to keep the engine
bloat free.

Hyde's plugin architecture is event driven; plugins get notified during the
course of the generation to allow them to alter/guide the generation process.

If you are interested in creating plugins for hyde, you can read the
[developer documentation][devdocs].
