§§ blurb
Hyde is a static website generator written in python. While Hyde took
life as [awesome Jekyll][Jekyll]&apos;s [evil twin][], it has since been
completely consumed by [the dark side][python] and has an [identity of its own][hydeid].

Hyde desires to fulfill the lofty goal of removing the
[pain points][static cons] involved in creating and maintaining
[static websites][static pros].

## Spotlight

*   Support for powerful template languages like [Jinja2][] complemented
    with custom tags and filters.
*   Rich [object model][] and
    overridable hierarchical [metadata][] thats available for use in
    templates.
*   Configurable [sorting, filtering and grouping][sorter] support.
*   Extensible [plugin architecture][plugins] with Text preprocessing and html
    postprocessing support for complex content transformations.
*   Instant preview using built-in [webserver][server] that regenerates content
    if needed.

## Install

There will be a package soon on pypi, but this works for now:

~~~sh~~~

pip install -e https://github.com/hyde/hyde#egg=hyde

~~~~~~~~

You can find more detailed documentation in the [installation section][install].

## Run

After installation is successful, creating & generating your website is
extremely simple.

To create a new hyde website:

~~~sh~~~
hyde -s /path/to/your site create
~~~~~~~~

To generate the website:

~~~sh~~~
cd /path/to/your/site
hyde gen
~~~~~~~~

To run the built in webserver that autogenerates if needed:

~~~sh~~~
hyde serve
~~~~~~~~

You can access the website now at `http://localhost:8080`

For all the supported options, read the [command line documentation][commandline]
or run `hyde -h`.
