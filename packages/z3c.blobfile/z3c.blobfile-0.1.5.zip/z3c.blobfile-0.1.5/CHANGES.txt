0.1.5 (2011-02-11)
------------------

- Put a ceiling (64k) on the number of info bytes read and read those bytes in
  one shot.

- Bug: Correctly detect the dimensions of JPEG images with the dimensions
  in a position greater than IMAGE_INFO_BYTES.

- Made tests compatible with ZODB 3.9.


0.1.4 (2009-03-03)
------------------

- Add copy hook for zope.copy to fix blob file/image copying.
- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org
  instead of retired zope3-dev.

0.1.3 (2008-10-20)
------------------

- Bug: Don't get/set image data twice on Image initialization.
- Cache file size and invalidate it on write access.
- Download file/image using new openDetached method that provides
  read-only file-like access to the blob, detached from the database
  connection.

0.1.2 (2008-09-11)
------------------

- Bug: Set i18n domain in "overrides.zcml" to avoid warnings.
- Don't expose Blob implementation details in add/upload forms. Also, "zope"
  translation domain has no translations for "Upload a File (Blob)", it just
  has "Upload a File" translations, so use it.

0.1.1 (2008-09-08)
------------------

- Bug: Register zope.app.wsgi.fileresult.FileResult as an adapter for BlobFile,
  making optimized file views really work.
- Bug: Also use optimized file view for z3c.blobfile.image.Image.
- Bug: Make blob versions of File and Image implement IBlobFile and
  IBlobImage interfaces respectively. This enables z3c.blobfile's views.
- Bug: Use local ZopeMessageFactory. This fixes import error on Zope 2.10

0.1.0 (2008-02-27)
------------------

- Initial Release
