        ************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jsgettext`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jsgettext`: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/jsgettext/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jsgettext``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``gettext`` from ``js.jsgettext`` and ``need`` it where
        you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jsgettext import gettext
          >>> gettext.need()
