js.jsgettext
************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jsgettext`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jsgettext`: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/jsgettext/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jsgettext``) are published to some URL.
