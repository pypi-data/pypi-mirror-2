PyarrFS - a RAR reading file system
===================================

PyarrFS is a FUSE based file system to access the content of RAR archives as if
they were just normal files and directories. PyarrFS owes technically to FUSE
and rarfile, while the idea originates out of YarrFS - a similar file system
written a few years back by a colleague (and based on my idea).

This code was inspired by the xmp.py example written by Jeff Epler and Csaba
Henk. Thank you!

Thanks to the folks who wrote FUSE and thanks to Marko Kreen for putting
together rarfile!

NOTE: Please do note that this application depends on rarfile 2.3 OR on my
	  non-standard version of rarfile, which you can get from
	  git.spritelink.net!
