    Generates a random :py:class:`~AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork` by assigning reaction randomly between all molecular species.

    Arguments:

    nmols
        Number of molecules in the reaction network.

    .. note::

        :py:class:`AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork` tracks molecules by their reactions, so if a molecule is not part of any reaction
        it will not appear at all e.g. in :py:attr:`~AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork.seen`. This could lead to differences from `nmols`.

    nreactions
        Number of reaction in the reaction network. 

    .. note::

        The value of `nreactions` is the number of times a reaction will be added to the :py:class:`~AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork`. If it
        is already in the :py:class:`~AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork`, it will be replaced. This can lead to :class:`AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork` with less
        than `nreactions` reactions.

    nreactants
        Number of reactants for each reaction in the reaction network. Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution).

        .. note::
            If this is a tuple/list it will be sampled for each reaction.

    nproducts
        Number of products for each reaction in the reaction network. Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution).

        If this is None, then `nreactants` must be a list/tuple of tuples of (`nreactants`, `nproducts`) pairs that will be uniformly sampled from. Or `nreactants` must be a dictionary with keys of (`nreactants`, `nproducts`) and values of weightings, which will be sampled from.

        .. note::
            If this is a tuple/list it will be sampled for each reaction.

    rates
        Rate of each reaction in the reaction network. Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution).

        .. note::
            If this is a tuple/list it will be sampled for each reaction.

    cls
        Alternative class to use for constructing the return rather than :py:class:`AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork`.

    rng
        Random number generator to use. If not specifed, one will be generated at random.


    These arguments can be a single value, a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from, or a dictionary of value/weighting which will be sampled from

    For example:

    ``Uniform(5,3,2,1)`` will generate 5 molecules with 3 reactions between them where each reaction has two reactants and one product.

    ``Uniform(5,3,(1,2), (1,2))`` will generate 5 molecules with 3 reactions between them where each reaction has one or two reactants and one or two products.

    ``Uniform(5,3,((2,1),(1,2)), None)`` will generate 5 molecules with 3 reactions between them where each reaction has either two reactants and one product or one reactant and two products.

    Generates a random :py:class:`~AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork` from molecules that are strings of atoms and can join together or break apart.

    Based on the paper Autocatalytic sets of proteins. 1986. Journal of Theoretical Biology 119:1-24 by Kauffman, Stuart A.  but without the explicit catalytic activity.


    Arguments:

    natoms
        Number of atoms to use. Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution), or a dict of value:weight which will be sampled from.

        it will not appear at all e.g. in :py:attr:`~AChemKit.reactionnet.ReactionNetwork.seen`.

    maxlength
        Maximum number of atoms in a molecule. If this is None, then they are unbounded; this might cause problems with a computational explosion. Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution), or a dict of value:weight which will be sampled from.

    pform
        Probability that a pair of molecules will join together per orientation. Must be between 0 and 1. Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution), or a dict of value:weight which will be sampled from.

    pbreak
        Probability that any pair of atoms will break. Must be between 0 and 1.Can be a single value or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution), or a dict of value:weight which will be sampled from.

    directed
        If false, molecules have no intrinsic direction so AlphBeta is equivlanet to BetaAlpha.

    rates
        Rate of each reaction in the reaction network. Can be a single value, or a tuple/list which will be uniformly sampled from (duplicates can be used to give a non-uniform distribution), or a dict of value:weight which will be sampled from.
