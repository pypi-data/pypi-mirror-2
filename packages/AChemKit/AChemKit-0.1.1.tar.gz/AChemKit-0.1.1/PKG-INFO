        Description
        ===========
        
        PyAChemKit is a Python implementation of an Artificial Chemistry Kit - a library and collection of tools. 
        
        Artificial Chemsistry (AChem) is a spin-off topic of Artificial Life. AChem is aimed at emergence of life from
        non-living environment - primordial soup etc.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install on Unix/Linux, run ::
        
        sudo python setup.py install
        
        This package should work on windows, but is untested.
        
        This package requires the following:
        
        * Python   >= 2.6   http://www.python.org/
            
        Optionally, the following can be installed to improve performance:
        
        * Psyco http://psyco.sourceforge.net
        * PyPy  http://codespeak.net/pypy
                
        Source
        ======
        
        Source code is available from https://github.com/afaulconbridge/PyAChemKit
        
        The source code additionally requires the following:
        
        * Sphinx   >= 1.0   http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
        * Graphviz          http://www.graphviz.org/
        * Make              http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
        * LaTeX             http://www.latex-project.org/
        * PyLint   >=0.13.0 http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint/
        * Coverage          http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/
        
        
        For a Debian-based Linux distrbution --- e.g. Debian, Ubuntu --- these can be installed / updated with::
        
            make setup
            
        (Note, LaTeX is not installed via this method because it is very large. Run ``sudo apt-get install texlive-full``)
        
        
        There is a makefile that will run some useful tasks for you (generate documentation, test, benchmark). This can be accessed by running the following command::
        
            make help
