Changelog
=========

4.0a5 (2011-03-02)
------------------

- Use the new ``plone.testing.security`` module to ensure isolation of
  security checkers when setting up and tearing down layers based on the
  ``PloneSandboxLayer`` helper base class. This would cause problems when
  running multiple test suites in the same test run, in particular if one of
  those suites were setting up ZCML that used ``five.grok``.

4.0a4 (2011-01-11)
------------------

- Automatically tear down PAS registrations via snapshotting when using
  ``PloneSandboxLayer``. It's too difficult to do this manually when you
  consider that plugins may be registered in ZCML via transitive dependencies.
  There should be no backwards compatibility concern - using
  ``tearDownMultiPlugin()`` is still supported, and it's generally safe to
  call it once.
  [optilude]

- Try to make sure ``tearDownMultiPlugin()`` and the generic PAS plugin
  cleanup handler do not interfere with the cleanup handler from the PAS
  ZCML directive.

- Do not install ``Products.kupu`` or ``Products.CMFPlacefulWorkflow``.
  [elro]

- Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.

4.0a3 (2010-12-14)
------------------

- Allow top-level import of PloneTestLifecycle.
  [stefan]

- Added a warning not to use 'default' Firefox profile for selenium tests.
  [zupo]

- Fixed distribution dependency declarations.
  [hannosch]

- Correct license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]

- Make some module imports helper methods on the already policy-heavy
  helper class per optilude's suggestion.
  [rossp]

- Add a layer and test case for running selenium tests.
  [rossp]

- Give the default test user differing user id and login name. This helps reveal
  problems with userid vs login name errors, an overly common error.

------------------

  [optilude]
