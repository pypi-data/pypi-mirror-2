History of jquery.pyproxy
=========================

0.2 (2010-10-22)
----------------

- renamed django.py in jq_django.py as it was giving conflicts when
  importing HttpResponse. [vincent]

- moved jquery.pyproxy.js in a folder called 'media' so it can be used
  easily by django user with django-appmedia. Also added some
  registration for plone users so jquery.pyproxy appears in the
  quick_installer and automatically adds the JS file to the
  jsregistry. [vincent]

- bugfix: fadeOut and fadeIn did not have correct names in
  plugins/jq_effects. [vincent]

- Added 'PreventDefault' in make_call - using 'return false' works for
  links but is not enough for submit buttons. [vincent]
