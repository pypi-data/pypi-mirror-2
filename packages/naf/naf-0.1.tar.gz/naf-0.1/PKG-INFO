Description: Why?!
        ====
        
        Daily programming tasks, such as code compilation and running automated tests, often consumes a lot of time even on rather small projects.
        
        While alt-tabbing away from the command you just started, this simple tool will help you to get back on your development track as soon as possible.
        
        Saving you minutes every day :)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            git clone git://github.com/knutz3n/naf.git
            cd naf
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            naf mvn clean install
        
        This will run "mvn clean install" and notify you when the command has exited with the exit code it returned.
