Description: Simple module to parse ISO 8601 dates
        
        This module parses the most common forms of ISO 8601 date strings (e.g.
        2007-01-14T20:34:22+00:00) into datetime objects.
        
        >>> import iso8601
        >>> iso8601.parse_date("2007-01-25T12:00:00Z")
        datetime.datetime(2007, 1, 25, 12, 0, tzinfo=<iso8601.iso8601.Utc ...>)
        >>>

        =======
        0.1.5
        -----
        
        * Forked original version by Michael Twomey located http://code.google.com/p/pyiso8601/ 
        * Added the ability to parse date without any time information.
        * Relicensed as Apache 2
        
        0.1.4
        -----
        
        * The default_timezone argument wasn't being passed through correctly,
          UTC was being used in every case. Fixes issue 10.
        
        0.1.3
        -----
        
        * Fixed the microsecond handling, the generated microsecond values were 
          way too small. Fixes issue 9.
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * Adding ParseError to __all__ in iso8601 module, allows people to import it.
          Addresses issue 7.
        * Be a little more flexible when dealing with dates without leading zeroes.
          This violates the spec a little, but handles more dates as seen in the 
          field. Addresses issue 6.
        * Allow date/time separators other than T.
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * When parsing dates without a timezone the specified default is used. If no
          default is specified then UTC is used. Addresses issue 4.
