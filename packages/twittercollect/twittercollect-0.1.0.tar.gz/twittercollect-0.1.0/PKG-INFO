        If you're simply looking to collect data, the quick and easy instructions are::
        
        $ mkdir /path/to/twitter/data
        $ cd /path/to/twitter/data
        $ twittercollect --bzip2 \
        >                --user USERNAME \
        >                --password PASSWORD \
        >                --stream-url STREAM_URL
        
        The process does not daemonize.  It is recommended that it be run in a screen
        session.  In a future release this will be changed so that it may be run as a
        system daemon.
        
        The most-available stream URL is
        http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json.  If you have another
        agreement with Twitter, substitute the provided URL here.  It is also possible
        to provide the username, password, and URL using environment variables.
        
        The public API can be summed up with just two functions.
