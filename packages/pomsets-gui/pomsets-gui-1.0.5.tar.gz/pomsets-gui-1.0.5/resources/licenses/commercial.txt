If you are a commercial entity (or employed by one) and intend to use pomsets within your organization, you will need to purchase a commercial license. This is true if you are either a developer who is developing an application that uses pomsets, as well as if you are using an application that incorporates pomsets. You are entitled to a 30 day, no cost evaluation of the software, once every 12 months.
