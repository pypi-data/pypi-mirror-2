Introduction
============

This library packages `YUI`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of YUI's
structure and different modes (normal, minified, debug).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`YUI`: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.yui``) are published to some URL.
