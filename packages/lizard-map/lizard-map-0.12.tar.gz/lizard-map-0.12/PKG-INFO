        ==========
        
        **Initial pypi release**.  See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui .
        Documentation is upcoming.
        
        
        Development installation
        ------------------------
        
        The first time, you'll have to run the "bootstrap" script to set up setuptools
        and buildout::
        
            $> python bootstrap.py
        
        And then run buildout to set everything up::
        
            $> bin/buildout
        
        (On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).
        
        You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in
        ``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        The current package is installed as a "development package", so
        changes in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python
        setup.py develop``).
        
        If you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released
        versions), add them as an "svn external" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory
        and add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.
        
        Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.
        
        External dependencies
        ---------------------
        
        You need pysqlite 2.5+
            $> sudo apt-get install python-pysqlite2
