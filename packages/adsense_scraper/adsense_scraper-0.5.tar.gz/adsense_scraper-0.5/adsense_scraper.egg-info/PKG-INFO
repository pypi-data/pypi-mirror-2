Description: 
        adsense_scraper is a simple module that uses Twill and html5lib to scrape
        Google AdSense earnings data from your account.
        
        For example, this is useful as a cron job or other sort of periodic task to 
        store a copy of your earnings in your own database so that you don't have
        to visit the AdSense site every day.
