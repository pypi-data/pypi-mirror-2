Description: =========================================
        Straight-forward REST client construction
        =========================================
        
        This package provides a simple mechanism for constructing clients for
        REST-based services.  Every client extends the RESTClient class, and
        every method which hits the REST service is decorated with the
        @restmethod() decorator.  The @restmethod() decorator causes the
        decorated method to be passed an additional argument (after the "self"
        argument): an HTTPRequest object.  The method may then manipulate
        request headers and the body of the request, then use the send()
        method on the HTTPRequest object to issue the request.  The return
        value of the send() method will be an httplib2.Response object, which
        can then be interpreted.  If the response is a redirection, httplib2
        will follow the redirection; if the response is an error (status code
        400 or greater), an exception is raised.
        
        JSON-based Clients
        ==================
        
        The rest package also includes the rest.jsclient module, which
        provides a JSONClient class geared toward those REST services which
        use JSON-encoded data.  An additional _attach_obj() method is provided
        for JSONClient, and responses have any available valid JSON decoded
        and placed in the ``obj`` attribute of the response.  (The ``body``
        attribute of the response is additionally set to the content of the
        response, whether or not it is valid JSON.)
