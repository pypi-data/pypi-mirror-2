Introduction
------------

This is a `Django CMS` menu plugin for replacing links in menus with the 
redirected URL.

Installation
------------

First, you must install `Django CMS` and `Django`. For full details, see the installation 
instructions for those packages.

Install ``cmsmenu-redirect`` to your environment with a tool such as `PIP`, 
`setuptools`, or `buildout`.

Add ``cmsmenu_redirect`` and ``django.contrib.redirects`` to the 
``INSTALLED_APPS`` list in your project's ``settings.py`` and run the 
``syncdb`` command on your ``manage.py``.

What's Inside
-------------

There is a ``menus`` Navigation Modifier that checks all nodes in the navigation
against the registered redirects (from ``django.contrib.redirects``). When a 
node has a redirect, the url of that node is rewritten for the redirect.
