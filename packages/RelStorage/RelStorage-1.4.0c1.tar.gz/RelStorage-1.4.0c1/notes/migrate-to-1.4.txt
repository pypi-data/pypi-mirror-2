Migrating to RelStorage version 1.4
-----------------------------------

Before following these directions, first upgrade to the schema of
RelStorage version 1.1.2 by following the directions in "migrate-to-1.1.2.txt".

Only Oracle needs a change for this release.  The Oracle adapter
now requires the installation of a PL/SQL package with ``SYS`` privileges.

Using Oracle 10g XE, you can start a ``SYS`` session with the following
shell commands::

    $ su - oracle
    $ sqlplus / as sysdba

The PL/SQL package below provides limited access to the DBMS_LOCK
package so that RelStorage can acquire user locks. Using ``sqlplus``
with ``SYS`` privileges, execute the following::

    CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE relstorage_util AS
        FUNCTION request_lock(id IN NUMBER, timeout IN NUMBER)
            RETURN NUMBER;
    END relstorage_util;
    /

    CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY relstorage_util AS
        FUNCTION request_lock(id IN NUMBER, timeout IN NUMBER)
            RETURN NUMBER IS
        BEGIN
            RETURN DBMS_LOCK.REQUEST(
                id => id,
                lockmode => DBMS_LOCK.X_MODE,
                timeout => timeout,
                release_on_commit => TRUE);
        END request_lock;
    END relstorage_util;
    /

Also with ``SYS`` privileges, grant the execute permission on the
relstorage_util package to the Oracle account that holds the
database.  In the example below, "zodb" is the name of the account::

    GRANT EXECUTE ON relstorage_util TO zodb;
