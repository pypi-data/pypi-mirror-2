Migrating to RelStorage version 1.4
-----------------------------------

Before following these directions, first upgrade to the schema of
RelStorage version 1.1.2 by following the directions in "migrate-to-1.1.2.txt".

Only Oracle needs a change for this release.  The Oracle adapter
now requires the EXECUTE permission on the DBMS_LOCK package.
In the example below, "zodb" is the name of the account::

    GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOCK TO zodb;

Also, the Oracle adapter in RelStorage no longer uses the commit_lock
table, so you can drop it.  It contains no data.

    DROP TABLE commit_lock;
