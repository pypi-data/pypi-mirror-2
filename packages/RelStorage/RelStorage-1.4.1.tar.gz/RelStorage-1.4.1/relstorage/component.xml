    <key name="read-only" datatype="boolean" default="false">
      <description>
        If true, only reads may be executed against the storage.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="blob-dir" required="no">
      <description>
        If supplied, the storage will provide blob support; this
        parameter specifies the name of the directory to hold blob data.
        The directory will be created if it doeesn't exist. If no value
        (or an empty value) is provided, then no blob support will be
        provided.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="keep-history" datatype="boolean" default="true">
      <description>
        If this parameter is set to true (the default), the adapter
        will create and use a history-preserving database schema
        (like FileStorage). A history-preserving schema supports
        ZODB-level undo, but also grows more quickly and requires extensive
        packing on a regular basis.

        If this parameter is set to false, the adapter will create and
        use a history-free database schema. Undo will not be supported,
        but the database will not grow as quickly. The database will
        still require regular garbage collection (which is accessible
        through the database pack mechanism.)

        This parameter must not change once the database schema has
        been installed, because the schemas for history-preserving and
        history-free storage are different. If you want to convert
        between a history-preserving and a history-free database, use
        the ``zodbconvert`` utility to copy to a new database.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="replica-conf" datatype="string" required="no">
      <description>
        If this parameter is provided, it specifies a text file that
        contains a list of database replicas this adapter can choose
        from. For MySQL and PostgreSQL, put in the replica file a list
        of ``host:port`` or ``host`` values, one per line. For Oracle,
        put in a list of DSN values. Blank lines and lines starting
        with ``#`` are ignored.

        The adapter prefers the first replica specified in the file. If
        the first is not available, the adapter automatically tries the
        rest of the replicas, in order. If the file changes, the
        adapter will drop existing SQL database connections and make
        new connections when ZODB starts a new transaction.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="replica-timeout" datatype="float" default="600.0">
      <description>
        If this parameter has a nonzero value, when the adapter selects
        a replica other than the primary replica, the adapter will
        try to revert to the primary replica after the specified
        timeout (in seconds).  The default is 600, meaning 10 minutes.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="poll-interval" datatype="float" required="no">
      <description>
        Defer polling the database for the specified maximum time interval,
        in seconds.  Set to 0 (the default) to always poll.  Fractional
        seconds are allowed.  Use this to lighten the database load on
        servers with high read volume and low write volume.

        The poll-interval option works best in conjunction with
        the cache-servers option.  If both are enabled, RelStorage will
        poll a single cache key for changes on every request.
        The database will not be polled unless the cache indicates
        there have been changes, or the timeout specified by poll-interval
        has expired.  This configuration keeps clients fully up to date,
        while removing much of the polling burden from the database.
        A good cluster configuration is to use memcache servers
        and a high poll-interval (say, 60 seconds).

        This option can be used without the cache-servers option,
        but a large poll-interval without cache-servers increases the
        probability of basing transactions on stale data, which does not
        affect database consistency, but does increase the probability
        of conflict errors, leading to low performance.

    </key>
    <key name="pack-gc" datatype="boolean" default="true">
      <description>
        If pack-gc is false, pack operations do not perform
        garbage collection.  Garbage collection is enabled by default.

        If garbage collection is disabled, pack operations keep at least one
        revision of every object.  With garbage collection disabled, the
        pack code does not need to follow object references, making
        packing conceivably much faster.  However, some of that benefit
        may be lost due to an ever increasing number of unused objects.

        Disabling garbage collection is also a hack that ensures
        inter-database references never break.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="pack-dry-run" datatype="boolean" default="false">
      <description>
        If pack-dry-run is true, pack operations perform a full analysis
        of what to pack, but no data is actually removed.  After a dry run,
        the pack_object, pack_state, and pack_state_tid tables are filled
        with the list of object states and objects that would have been
        removed.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="pack-batch-timeout" datatype="float" required="no">
      <description>
        Packing occurs in batches of transactions; this specifies the
        timeout in seconds for each batch.  Note that some database
        configurations have unpredictable I/O performance
        and might stall much longer than the timeout.
        The default timeout is 5.0 seconds.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="pack-duty-cycle" datatype="float" required="no">
      <description>
        After each batch, the pack code pauses for a time to
        allow concurrent transactions to commit.  The pack-duty-cycle
        specifies what fraction of time should be spent on packing.
        For example, if the duty cycle is 0.75, then 75% of the time
        will be spent packing: a 6 second pack batch
        will be followed by a 2 second delay.  The duty cycle should
        be greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0.  Specify
        1.0 for no delay between batches.

        The default is 0.5.  Raise it to finish packing faster; lower it
        to reduce the effect of packing on transaction commit performance.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="pack-max-delay" datatype="float" required="no">
      <description>
        This specifies a maximum delay between pack batches.  Sometimes
        the database takes an extra long time to finish a pack batch; at
        those times it is useful to cap the delay imposed by the
        pack-duty-cycle.  The default is 20 seconds.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="cache-servers" datatype="string" required="no">
      <description>
        Specifies a list of memcached servers. Using memcached with
        RelStorage improves the speed of frequent object accesses while
        slightly reducing the speed of other operations.

        Provide a list of host:port pairs, separated by whitespace.
        "127.0.0.1:11211" is a common setting.  Some memcached modules,
        such as pylibmc, allow you to specify a path to a Unix socket
        instead of a host:port pair.

        The default is to disable memcached integration.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="cache-module-name" datatype="string" required="no">
      <description>
        Specifies which Python memcache module to use.  The default is
        "memcache", a pure Python module.  An alternative module is
        "relstorage.pylibmc_wrapper".  This setting has no effect
        unless cache-servers is set.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="cache-prefix" datatype="string" required="no">
      <description>
        The prefix for all keys in the cache.  All clients using a
        database should use the same cache-prefix.  Use this if you use
        a single cache for multiple databases.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="cache-local-mb" datatype="integer" required="no">
      <description>
        RelStorage caches pickled objects in memory, similar to a ZEO
        cache. This cache is shared between threads. This parameter
        configures the approximate maximum amount of memory the cache
        should consume, in megabytes.  It defaults to 10.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="cache-delta-size-limit" datatype="integer" required="no">
      <description>
        This is an advanced option. RelStorage uses a system of
        checkpoints to improve the cache hit rate. This parameter
        configures how many objects should be stored before creating a
        new checkpoint in the cache. The default is 10000.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="commit-lock-timeout" datatype="integer" required="no">
      <description>
        During commit, RelStorage acquires a database-wide lock. This
        parameter specifies how long to wait for the lock before
        failing the attempt to commit. The default is 30 seconds.

        The MySQL and Oracle adapters support this parameter. The
        PostgreSQL adapter currently does not.
      </description>
    </key>
    <key name="commit-lock-id" datatype="integer" required="no">
      <description>
        During commit, RelStorage acquires a database-wide lock. This
        parameter specifies the lock ID. This parameter currently
        applies only to the Oracle adapter.

        The PostgreSQL data source name.  For example:

        dsn dbname='template1' user='user' host='localhost' password='pass'

        If dsn is omitted, the adapter will connect to a local database with
        no password.  Both the user and database name will match the
        name of the owner of the current process.
