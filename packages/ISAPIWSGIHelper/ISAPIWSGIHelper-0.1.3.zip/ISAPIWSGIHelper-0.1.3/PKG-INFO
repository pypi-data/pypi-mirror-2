Description: 
        Introduction
        ---------------
        
        ISAPIWSGIHelper is a small command line script and some helper
        utilities to help bootstrap deployment of WSGI
        applications using `isapi-wsgi <http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/>`_ with
        Microsoft IIS.
        
        Prerequisites
        ---------------
        
        The following should be installed:
        
        * Python
        * Python Win32 Extensions
        
        In addition, python's scripts directory should already be in your path.  If
        commands like ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` already function, you should be good to go.
        
        You should be familiar with IIS and how to load ISAPI extensions into websites
        and virtual directories.  You should be familiar with isapi-wsgi setup.
        
        Dependencies
        --------------------
        
        * argparse
        * isapi_wsgi
        
        Install
        --------------------
        
        ``easy_install ISAPIWSGIHelper`` or ``pip install ISAPIWSGIHelper`` will get
        the job done.
        
        **Note:** ISAPIWSGIHelper should be installed in python's site-packages directory,
        not in a virtualenv.
        
        Usage
        --------------------
        
        The "iwhelper" command is installed when installing the ISAPIWSGIHelper
        package.
        
        A virtualenv is recommended, but not required:
        
            > cd c:\\somewhere\\myproj-venv
        
            > virtualenv .
        
            > iwhelper
        
        The above will result in a virtualenv with the addition of a isapi-wsgi
        directory in the root of the venv.  Edit ``isapi-wsgi\\appinit.py`` according
        to the comments in that file.
        
        Then, setup your website or a virtualdirectory with a wildcard mapping
        that uses ``isapi-wsgi\\__loader.dll``.
        
        Features
        --------------------
        
        The isapi-wsgi directory created by the ``iwhelper`` command results in
        a setup with the following features:
        
        * Easy creation of per-project isapi-wsgi bootstrap directories through the
            ``iwhelper`` command (see above)
        * Exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.  No more cryptic 500 status
            responses from IIS.
        
            * exceptions instantiating the application are initially hidden but can
                be displayed to the browser with a configuration change in _loader.py.
            * exceptions encountered when making a request to the application are
                logged to a file in the isapi-wsgi directory.
        
        * appinit.py provides a simple bridge between isapi-wsgi and your application
        * appinit.py provides a mechanism for loading a virtualenv's site-packages dir
        
        Special Troubleshooting w/ _loader.py:
        -----------------------------------------
        
        If push comes to shove and you just can't figure out why your application isn't
        working, _loader.py provides a special mechanism for running your setup in
        a python web server which will give you better exception messages and
        automatic reloading of your python files when they are changed.  See the
        note at the bottom of _loader.py for details.
        
        A Note About App Pools
        ------------------------
        
        I use a different app pool for each python website.  When troubleshooting, I set
        the app pool to auto-recycle after one request.  This is a close equivalent to
        auto-reloading in various python development web servers.  Just remember to
        **turn it off** before going to production usage or your performance will suffer
        tremendously.
