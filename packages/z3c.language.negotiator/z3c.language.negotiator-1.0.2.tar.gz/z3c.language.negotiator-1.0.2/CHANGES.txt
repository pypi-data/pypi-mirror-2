1.0.1 (2008-01-24)
------------------

- Bug: Corrected meta data.


1.0.0 (2008-01-21)
------------------

- Restructure: Removed the two vocabularies
  ``AvailableTranslationDomainLanguagesVocabulary`` and
  ``AvailableTranslationDomainLanguagesVocabularyForZ3C`` which depend on the
  ``zope.app.i18n`` implementation. Note these vocabularies are not persistent
  and if you will need it, let's implement this in another package. This
  allows us to skip all dependencies to ``zope.app.i18n``.

- Restructure: Moved ``zope.language.negotiator`` to it's namespace package.
