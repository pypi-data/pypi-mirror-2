        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jqgrid`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jqgrid`: http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/
        
        To include the grid, call js.jqgrid.jqgrid.need(), then you also need to add
        a language, for example js.jqgrid.jqgrid_i18n_en.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jqgrid``) are published to some URL.
