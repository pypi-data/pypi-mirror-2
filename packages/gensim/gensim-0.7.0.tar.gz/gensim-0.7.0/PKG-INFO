Description: ==============================================
        gensim -- Python Framework for Topic Modeling
        ==============================================
        
        **Gensim** is a Python framework designed to help make
        the conversion of natural language texts to their underlying semantic representation as
        simple and natural as possible.
        
        Gensim contains fast implementations of algorithms for
        unsupervised learning from raw, unstructured digital texts,
        such as **Latent Semantic Analysis**, **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** or **Random Projections**.
        These algorithms discover hidden (*latent*) corpus structure.
        Once found, documents can be succinctly expressed in terms of this structure,
        queried for semantic similarity and so on.
        
        If the previous paragraphs left you confused, you can first read more about the `Vector
        Space Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model>`_ and `unsupervised
        document analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing>`_ on Wikipedia.
        
        .. note::
        
        `gensim`'s target audience is the NLP research community and interested general public;
        `gensim` is not meant to be a production tool for commercial environments.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This software depends on NumPy and Scipy, two Python packages for scientific computing.
        You must have them installed prior to installing `gensim`. You can get them from <http://www.scipy.org/Download>.
        
        The simple way to install `gensim` is::
        
        sudo easy_install gensim
        
        Or, if you have instead downloaded and unzipped the `source tar.gz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gensim>`_ package,
        you'll need to run::
        
        python setup.py test
        sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        For alternative modes of installation (without root priviledges, development
        installation), see the `documentation <http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projekty/gensim/install.html>`_.
        
        This version has been tested under Python 2.5 and 2.6, but should run on any 2.5 <= Python < 3.0.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Manual for the gensim package is available in `HTML <http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projekty/gensim/>`_. It
        contains a walk-through of all the features and a complete reference section.
        It is also included in the source distribution package.
