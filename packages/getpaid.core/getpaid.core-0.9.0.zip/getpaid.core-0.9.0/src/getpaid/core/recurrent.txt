Creating an Order
=================

    >>> from getpaid.core.order import Order
    >>> order = Order()

Carts and Line Items
====================

An order consists of line items. line items can come from a variety of
sources, content space payables, gift certificates, ie. anything we
potentially want to purchase, we'll use RecurringLineItem here...

    >>> from getpaid.core.item import RecurringLineItem
    >>> item = RecurringLineItem()

Let's set some attributes expected on line items. The only system invariant
here is that item_id should be unique when referring to purchasing the same
item:

    >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1"
    >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
    >>> item.cost = 25.00
    >>> item.quantity = 5
    >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
    >>> item.interval = 1 # in months
    >>> item.total_occurrences = 12

Line Items are stored in a line item container, such as a shopping cart
of shipment:

    >>> from getpaid.core.cart import ShoppingCart
    >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
    >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item

we can ask the cart how many items it has:

    >>> cart.size()
    5

You cannot add any other items to the cart once it contains a 
RecurringLineItem:

    >>> item2 = RecurringLineItem()
    >>> item2.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-2"
    >>> item2.name = "Event Registration 2"
    >>> item2.cost = 35.00
    >>> item2.quantity = 1
    >>> item2.description = "Another Development Talk"
    >>> item2.interval = 1 # in months
    >>> item2.total_occurrences = 12

Adding the second item will raise a custom exception:

    >>> cart[ item2.item_id ] = item2
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AddRecurringItemException: ...    

Let's attach our cart to the order:

    >>> order.shopping_cart = cart

and now we can ask the order, its total price:

    >>> order.getSubTotalPrice()
    Decimal("125.0")

Customer Information
====================

We need some additional information for an order to successfully process it:

    >>> from getpaid.core import payment
    >>> bill_address = payment.BillingAddress()
    >>> bill_address.bill_first_line = '1418 W Street NW'
    >>> bill_address.bill_city = 'Washington'
    >>> bill_address.bill_state = "DC"
    >>> bill_address.bill_country = "US"
    >>> bill_address.bill_postal_code = '20009'
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> contact_info = payment.ContactInformation()
    >>>
    >>> order.contact_information = contact_info
    >>> order.billing_address = bill_address

If we don't need to ship anything to the user, then we can forgo
setting a shipping address.

Now we'll test the order workflow...

    >>> from getpaid.core.interfaces import IOrderWorkflowLog
    >>> olog = IOrderWorkflowLog( order )

Before we fire the 'create' transition we don't have a workflow states
for finance and fulfillment

    >>> state = order.fulfillment_state
    >>> print state
    None

    >>> state = order.finance_state
    >>> print state
    None

Empty log...
    >>> list( iter( olog ) )
    []

Firing the 'create' transition in the finance workflow should put us
in the REVIEWING state

     >>> order.finance_workflow.fireTransition('create')
     >>> state = order.finance_state
     >>> print state
     REVIEWING

    >>> loglist = list(iter(olog ))
    >>> len(loglist)
    1

    >>> loglist[0].new_state
    'REVIEWING'

Firing some more transitions to test the finance workflow.

     >>> order.finance_workflow.fireTransition('authorize')
     >>> state = order.finance_state
     >>> print state
     CHARGEABLE

     >>> order.finance_workflow.fireTransition('charge-chargeable')
     >>> state = order.finance_state
     >>> print state
     CHARGING

    >>> loglist = list(iter(olog ))
    >>> len(loglist)
    3

    >>> loglist[0].new_state
    'REVIEWING'
    >>> loglist[1].new_state
    'CHARGEABLE'
    >>> loglist[2].new_state
    'CHARGING'

Now testing order manager...

    >>> from zope import component
    >>> from getpaid.core import interfaces
    >>> order_manager = component.getUtility( interfaces.IOrderManager )
    >>> # order.order_id = u'1'
    >>> # order_manager.store( order )
