Introduction
============

This is a Plone event replacement, released as needed dependency for `monet.calendar.event`__
product and the `monet.calendar.star`__ suite.

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monet.calendar.event
__ http://plone.org/products/monet.calendar.star

This product is no more released to be used as indipendent, but is needed for historical reason.
The *generic setup* profile inside it is disabled (so you can't install it).

If you don't need the *monet.calendar suite*, move away from this package.
