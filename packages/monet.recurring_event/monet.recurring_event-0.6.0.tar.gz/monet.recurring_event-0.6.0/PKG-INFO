Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a Plone event replacement, released as needed dependency for `monet.calendar.event`__
        product and the `monet.calendar.star`__ suite.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monet.calendar.event
        __ http://plone.org/products/monet.calendar.star
        
        This product is no more released to be used as indipendent, but is needed for historical reason.
        The *generic setup* profile inside it is disabled (so you can't install it).
        
        If you don't need the *monet.calendar suite*, move away from this package.
