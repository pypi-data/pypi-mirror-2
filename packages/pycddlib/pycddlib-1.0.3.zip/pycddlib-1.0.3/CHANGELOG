Version 1.0.3 (24 August 2010)
* added Matrix.canonicalize method
* sanitized NumberTypeable class: no more __cinit__ magic: derived
  classes can decide to call __init__ or not
* improved Matrix constructor: number type is derived from the type of
  the elements passed to the constructor, so in general, there is no
  need any more to pass a number_type argument (although this still
  remains supported)
* added get_number_type_from_value and get_number_type_from_sequences
  functions to aid subclasses to determine their number type.

Version 1.0.2 (9 August 2010)
* new NumberTypeable base class to allow different representations to be
  delegated to construction
* everything is now contained in the cdd module
* code refactored and better organized

Version 1.0.1 (1 August 2010)
* minor documentation updates
* also support the GMPRATIONAL build of cddlib with Python's fractions.Fraction
* using MPIR so it also builds on Windows
* removed trailing newlines in __str__ methods
* modules are now called cdd (uses float) and cddgmp (uses Fraction)

Version 1.0.0 (21 July 2010)
