Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        You have a site where you would like to list some internal or external references but you are
        not able to present them in a nice way. With raptus.article.reference you can do it. 
        
        The following features for raptus.article are provided by this package:

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install raptus.article.reference into your Plone instance, locate the file
        buildout.cfg in the root of your Plone instance directory on the file system,
        and open it in a text editor.
        
        Add the actual raptus.article.reference add-on to the "eggs" section of
        buildout.cfg. Look for the section that looks like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
        
        This section might have additional lines if you have other add-ons already
        installed. Just add the raptus.article.reference on a separate line, like this::
        
            eggs =
                Plone
                raptus.article.reference
        
        Note that you have to run buildout like this::
        
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Then go to the "Add-ons" control panel in Plone as an administrator, and
        install or reinstall the "raptus.article.default" product.
        
        Note that if you do not use the raptus.article.default package you have to
        include the zcml of raptus.article.reference either by adding it
        to the zcml list in your buildout or by including it in another package's
        configure.zcml.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Edit an article which is contained in another. You will now have the new options 
        "Internal reference" and "External reference" in your tab "settings". Add your 
        reference press "save". The link on the specific article displayed by the components
        listing sub articles now refers to the specified reference. The following packages
        provide components respecting the reference setting:
        
            * `raptus.article.listings <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptus.article.listings>`_
            * `raptus.article.contentfader <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptus.article.contentfader>`_
            * `raptus.article.contentflow <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptus.article.contentflow>`_
