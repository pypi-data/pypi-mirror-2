Beets is the media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music
geeks.

The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all.
It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes.
It then provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

Here's an example of beets' brainy tag corrector doing its thing::

  $ beet import ~/music/ladytron
  Tagging: Ladytron - Witching Hour
  (Distance: 0.016165)
   * Last One Standing -> The Last One Standing
   * Beauty -> Beauty*2
   * White Light Generation -> Whitelightgenerator
   * All the Way -> All the Way...

Because beets is designed as a library, you can easily write Python programs
that manipulate your music for you. Report tracks encoded at less than
192kbps? Done. Find albums you're missing from bands you like? Convert
everything to Title Case once and for all? Done and done.

Beets also includes a music player that speaks the MPD protocol, so you can
play music in your beets library using a staggering variety of interfaces.
