Description: Beets is a media library management system
        for obsessive-compulsive music geeks.
        
        The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once
        and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically
        improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database.
        It then provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing
        your music.
        
        Beets also includes a music player that implements the MPD
        protocol, so you can play music in your beets library using any
        MPD client.
