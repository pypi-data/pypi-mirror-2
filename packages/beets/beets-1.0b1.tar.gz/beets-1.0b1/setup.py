      long_description="""Beets is a media library management system
      for obsessive-compulsive music geeks.

      The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once
      and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically
      improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database.
      It then provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing
      your music.
      
      Beets also includes a music player that implements the MPD
      protocol, so you can play music in your beets library using any
      MPD client.
