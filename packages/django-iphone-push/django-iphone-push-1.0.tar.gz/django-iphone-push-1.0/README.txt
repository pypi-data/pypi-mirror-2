This is a very simple Django project that will allow you to add the ability to push notifications to your iPhone Application quickly and easily.

As you can see from the shot from the left. I used this code to implement push notifications for my upcoming iPhone Application called Tube Notify. I'm sure release this will now mean someone might copycat me, but I wanted to share this code so that others could get through the mystification of Apple's APN service.

I'll add to this page with more examples at some point in the not-to-distant future.
