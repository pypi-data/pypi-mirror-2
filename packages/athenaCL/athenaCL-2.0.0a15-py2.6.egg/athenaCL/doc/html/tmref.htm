>This TextureModule provides free access to Path pitch collections in an order, rate, simultaneity size, and simultaneity composition determined by generator ParameterObjects. Path Multisets are directly selected by index values generated by a ParameterObject; all values are probabilistically rounded to the nearest integer and are resolved by the modulus of the Path length. The number of simultaneities created from a selected Multiset is controlled by a generator ParameterObject; all values are probabilistically rounded to the nearest integer. Pitches within Multisets are directly chosen by index values generated by a ParameterObject; all values are probabilistically rounded to the nearest integer and are resolved by the modulus of the Multiset size. The number of pitches extracted from a Multiset is controlled by a generator ParameterObject; a size of zero takes all pitches from the selected Multiset; sizes greater than the number of pitches are resolved to the maximum number of pitches. Remaining event parameters are determined by their respective ParameterObjects.</P

Path Multisets and pitches within Multisets are chosen by selectors. The number of simultaneities that are created from a Multiset, and the number of pitches in each simultaneity, are controlled by generator ParameterObjects; all values are probabilistically rounded to the nearest integer. When extracting pitches, a size of zero takes all pitches from the selected Multiset; sizes greater than the number of available pitches are resolved to the maximum number of pitches.

>This TextureModule interpolates parameters between events generated under a non-linear monophonic context. All standard and auxiliary parameters, or just time parameters, can be interpolated. Interpolation method may be linear, power, or half-cosine. Frames are generated between each event at a rate controlled by a ParameterObject. Frame rates can be updated once per event or once per frame, as set by the level frame duration texture parameter. Power segment interpolation may use dynamic exponent values from a ParameterObject; exponent values are updated once per event. Note: independent of silenceMode, silent events are always created.</P

Algorithmic ornamentation is added to a line based on two factors: the selection of an ornament repertory, and the specification of ornament density. Ornament pitch values, where integers are half steps, are additionally shifted by a value produced by a generator ParameterObject.</P
