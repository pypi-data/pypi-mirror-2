====================================================================
I. PLATFORM DEPENDENCIES:

athenaCL is distributed as executable cross-platform source-code. Platform-
specific distributions and installers are provided for convenience. Make sure
you have downloaded the correct archive for your platform:

    Distributions:

Python EGG
http://www.flexatone.net/athenaCL/athenaCL.egg

unix (GNU/Linux, BSD), Macintosh MacOS X
http://www.flexatone.net/athenaCL/athenaCL.tar.gz

Windows (any)
http://www.flexatone.net/athenaCL/athenaCL.exe


====================================================================
II. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES:

athenaCL requires Python 2.5 to 2.6. Python 3.0 and better is not yet supported.
There is no athenaCL binary: athenaCL interactive sessions run inside a Python
interpreter. Python is free and runs on every platform. No additional software
is required for basic athenaCL operation. Download Python here:
http://www.python.org/download

athenaCL produces both Csound and MIDI scores. Csound 5 is recommended; Csound
4.16 or better is required to render Csound scores. Csound is free and runs on
every platform. Download Csound here:
http://www.csounds.com

athenaCL produces images with various Python-based graphic output systems. These
output systems include the Python TkInter GUI library and the Python Image
Library (PIL), and may require additional Python software. Most Python
distributions include TkInter (MacOS systems may require additional
configuration); PIL is easily added to Python. Download PIL here:
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

====================================================================
IIIa. QUICK-START DISTRIBUTIONS:

All Platforms
    1. install Python 2.6
    2. decompress athenaCL distribution and place wherever desired

UNIX, Command Line Environments, Macintosh MacOS X:
    3. % python setup.py
    4. % python athenacl.py

For more information and additional installation options, see below.

====================================================================
IIIb. QUICK-START INSTALLERS:

Python Prompt
    1. double click the installer and follow the instructions
    2. start Python
    3. &#62;&#62;&#62; import athenaCL.athenacl
    
Windows Installer (exe)
    1. double click the .exe file and follow the instructions
    2. start python.exe
    3. &#62;&#62;&#62; import athenaCL.athenacl

For more information and additional installation options, see below.

====================================================================
IVa. INSTALLATION:

Two installation methods are available: (1) placing the athenaCL directory
wherever desired, or (2) installing the athenaCL source into the Python library
with the Python Distribution Utilities (distutils). Both permit using athenaCL
as an interactive application and as a library imported in Python.

Installing athenaCL consist of running the file "setup.py", a script that
performs installation procedures.

The setup.py script can take arguments to perform optional installation
procedures. (1) the "tool" argument, on UNIX and MacOS X systems, will install a
command-line utility launcher, "athenacl," as well as a corresponding man page.
(2) the "install" argument, on all platforms, will perform a Python distutils
installation into the Python site-packages directory. (3) the "uninstall" option
will remove all athenaCL installation files and directories.

====================================================================
IVb. athenaCL VIA COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI):

installing:
    1. decompress athenaCL
    2. place athenaCL directory wherever you like
    3. enter the athenaCL directory
    4. % python setup.py

or, to install the "athenacl" launcher and the athenaCL man page:
    4. % python setup.py tool

or, to perform a distutils installation
    4. % python setup.py install

launching from the command line interface:
    5. % python athenacl.py

launching with the athenaCL tool:
    5. % /usr/local/bin/athenacl

launching with the athenaCL tool and /usr/local/bin in PATH:
    5. % athenacl

====================================================================
IVd. athenaCL VIA IDLE:

installing:
    1. decompress athenaCL
    2. place athenaCL directory wherever you like
    3. enter the athenaCL directory
    4. double-click "setup.py"

launching on Windows:
    5. double-click "athenacl.py"
    6. enter "y" when asked to start athenaCL in IDLE

launching from the command line interface:
    5. % python athenacl.py -s idle

====================================================================
IVd. athenaCL VIA PYTHON PROMPT

If the athenaCL setup.py script has been successfully completed, Python should
already by aware of the location of the current athenaCL installation. If the
athenaCL setup.py script has not been properly run, the directory containing
athenaCL must be manually added to the Python sys.path:
(if the athenaCL directory is located in the directory "/src")
    1. &#62;&#62;&#62; import sys
    2. &#62;&#62;&#62; sys.path.append('/src')

launching:
    3. &#62;&#62;&#62; import athenaCL.athenacl
