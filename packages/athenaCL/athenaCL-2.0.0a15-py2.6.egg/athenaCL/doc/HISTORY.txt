athenaCL Version History


====================================================================
to do (user-level):


TEmidi: renamed as TEbr (beat reference), TEtr (time ref), or TEref: 
   store parameterObjects for tempo and for time signature generation
   tempo can only be updated once per measure
   would be like a conductor track, but it does not direct time: adds info
   would require changing ao.midiTempo
   musicXml and humdrum event list output possible with beat + tempo def
   beat + tempo def can be used to latch rt evaluation of generated scores

global shared parameter objects that are stored in a dictionary
each parameter obj can have a role, with default roles given for 
tempoReference, meterReferenceNumerator, meterReferenceDenominator
need to have a generator to determine tempoSampleRate (intervals in which new tempos are drawn)

store in a dictionary with noId, role, pmtr string
TextureGlobal (TGls, TGn, TGe, TGrm)

store last-used tm



provide EMv, output engine help, output format information

TPef (TPeg complete): export filter parameters

add support for nyquist, chuck, and supercollider

problem with equal-valued pulses: exact overlap of duration end and event start
   may cause some events to be dropped w/ some output systems

new csound instruments:
   vocode w/ pluck on output channels

new PO:
   convert a rhythm parameter object to a pulse sequence
   convert a rhythm parameter object to envelops w/ fixed attach/rel?
   both have bpm supplied by an argument

====================================================================
to do (sub-user level):


add WAV support to audioTools.py with wave module
permit turning off path voice calculations

check output type of po given to texture parameters like amp
need to provide output type check for dyn pmtr objs in TMs
   define in manifest, check during update

move file path information from fpAudioDirs into aoInfo dictionary
   adjust TPmap's use of artificial aoInfo to pass paths to EventSeqeunceSplit

TEmap drawing muted textures incorectly
   spacing error seems only in postScript
   color error seems to be in clone 


====================================================================
to investigate:

add two parameter objects to each texture, setting upper and lower pitch space boundaries. this might be used to map pitches within dynamic boundaries after path selection, octave, and transposition controls are employed

not sure what to do when values are not within boundary: may need a new texture mode to configure this: limiting at boundary is not good, as this destroys the pitch strucutre; better is to do an octave shift, perhaps



double masks

event mode for arbitrary midi controllers as aux values

Csound 5: render scores from within python
   conditional import csnd.py; may need to add to sys.path

create bundle, in folders, rather than top-level files

allow support for SCORE style rhythm notation

object factory storing: optimize by keeping instances and copying?
