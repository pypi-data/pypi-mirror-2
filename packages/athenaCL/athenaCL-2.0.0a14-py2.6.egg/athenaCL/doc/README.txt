I. PLATFORM DEPENDENCIES:

athenaCL is distributed as executable cross-platform source-code. Platform-specific distributions and installers are provided for convenience. Make sure you have downloaded the correct archive for your platform:

    Distributions:

Python EGG
http://www.flexatone.net/athenaCL/athenaCL.egg

unix (GNU/Linux, BSD), Macintosh MacOS X
http://www.flexatone.net/athenaCL/athenaCL.tar.gz

Windows (any)
http://www.flexatone.net/athenaCL/athenaCL.exe


_____________..__._________________________________________________.
II. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES:

athenaCL requires Python 2.5 to 2.6. Python 3.0 and better is not yet supported. There is no athenaCL binary: athenaCL interactive sessions run inside a Python interpreter. Python is free and runs on every platform. No additional software is required for basic athenaCL operation. Download Python here:
http://www.python.org/download

athenaCL produces both Csound and MIDI scores. Csound 5 is recommended; Csound 4.16 or better is required to render Csound scores. Csound is free and runs on every platform. Download Csound here:
http://www.csounds.com

athenaCL produces images with various Python-based graphic output systems. These output systems include the Python TkInter GUI library and the Python Image Library (PIL), and may require additional Python software. Most Python distributions include TkInter (MacOS systems may require additional configuration); PIL is easily added to Python. Download PIL here:

IIIa. QUICK-START DISTRIBUTIONS:

All Platforms
    1. install Python 2.6
    2. decompress athenaCL distribution and place wherever desired

UNIX, Command Line Environments, Macintosh MacOS X:
    3. % pythonw setup.py
    4. % pythonw athenacl.py

For more information and additional installation options, see below.

____________________________________________.___________.___________
IIIb. QUICK-START INSTALLERS:

Python Prompt
    1. double click the installer and follow the instructions
    2. start Python
    3. >>> import athenaCL.athenacl
    
Windows Installer (exe)
    1. double click the .exe file and follow the instructions
    2. start python.exe
    3. >>> import athenaCL.athenacl

For more information and additional installation options, see below.

____.___.___________._____________________________________________._
IVa. INSTALLATION:

Two installation methods are available: (1) placing the athenaCL directory wherever desired, or (2) installing the athenaCL source into the Python library with the Python Distribution Utilities (distutils). Both permit using athenaCL as an interactive application and as a library imported in Python.

Installing athenaCL consist of running the file "setup.py", a script that performs installation procedures.

The setup.py script can take arguments to perform optional installation procedures. (1) the "tool" argument, on UNIX and MacOS X systems, will install a command-line utility launcher, "athenacl," as well as a corresponding man page. (2) the "install" argument, on all platforms, will perform a Python distutils installation into the Python site-packages directory. (3) the "uninstall" option will remove all athenaCL installation files and directories.

IVb. athenaCL VIA COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI):

installing:
    1. decompress athenaCL
    2. place athenaCL directory wherever you like
    3. enter the athenaCL directory
    4. % python setup.py

or, to install the "athenacl" launcher and the athenaCL man page:
    4. % python setup.py tool

or, to perform a distutils installation
    4. % python setup.py install

launching from the command line interface:
    5. % python athenacl.py

launching with the athenaCL tool:
    5. % /usr/local/bin/athenacl

launching with the athenaCL tool and /usr/local/bin in PATH:
    5. % athenacl

____._____________________.___________________.____.________________
IVc. athenaCL VIA PYTHON INTERPRETER APPLICATION (PIA):

installing:
    1. decompress athenaCL
    2. place athenaCL directory wherever you like
    3. enter the athenaCL directory
    4. double-click "setup.py"

launching:
    5. double-click "athenacl.py"

_________________________________._._____.__________________________
IVd. athenaCL VIA IDLE:

installing:
    1. decompress athenaCL
    2. place athenaCL directory wherever you like
    3. enter the athenaCL directory
    4. double-click "setup.py"

launching on Windows:
    5. double-click "athenacl.py"
    6. enter "y" when asked to start athenaCL in IDLE

launching from the command line interface:
    5. % python athenacl.py -s idle

__._______________________________________________________._____.___
IVe. athenaCL VIA PYTHON PROMPT (PP)

If the athenaCL setup.py script has been successfully completed, Python should already by aware of the location of the current athenaCL installation. If the athenaCL setup.py script has not been properly run, the directory containing athenaCL must be manually added to the Python sys.path:
(if the athenaCL directory is located in the directory "/src")
    1. >>> import sys
    2. >>> sys.path.append('/src')

launching:
    3. >>> import athenaCL.athenacl
