This is tricky.  I need some example object files in order to run
reasonable tests.  However, if I use GPL code, then I also need to
ship the source for that object.  I can't just build the object I need
at test time because no single build machine is likely to have all of
the cross compilers I'd need to do so.

What exists here is some trivial code which I am releasing into the
public domain.  If you have access to an ELF producing tool chain
which is not yet represented here, please build this code and either
commit or ship me the results so that I can incorporate them into
these tests.

The easiest way to do this is as follows:

    mkdir `./config.guess`
    (cd `./config.guess` && ../configure && make)

You can add them to mercurial using:

    (cd `./config.guess` && make add)
