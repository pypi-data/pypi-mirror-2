        syscon
        ======
        
        syscon is a python package providing remote control tools for other computers
        in the network. At the moment, syscon is still a beta version, since I hope
        to be able to add some new functions.
        
        Please use the control2.py and client2.py[w] module, the other ones are not
        working...
        
        Syntax
        ======
        
        
        Client
        ------
        
        On the client, you just have to start the client2.pyw or client2.py
        
        controlling Computer
        --------------------
        
        On the controlling computer, usage is as follows:
        
        	import syscon.control2
        	
        	con = syscon.control2.Connection("RemoteComputerName")
        	# This defines con as a connection with the Computer "RemoteComputerName
        	# over port 51000. If you want to use another port, use the second
        	# parameter, e.g. for port 9999:
        	# con = syscon.control2.Connection("RemoteComputerName", 9999)
        	
        	# Now send orders with con.send (next section)
        	
        	con.send("stopcontrol")
        	# This immediately stops the connection and closes the client2.py[w]
        	# at the other computer
        	
        
        Orders to remote computer
        =========================
        
        There are the following orders in version 0.2.0:
        
        1. **execpy**: This command needs a second parameter. The code from the second parameter is executed with "exec" on the remote machine.
        
        2. **executefile**: Starts the program specified in the second parameter.
        
        3. **download**: Downloads the file from the url in the third parameter to the local path (on the remote computer) in the second parameter.
        
        4. **shutdown**: Sends a shutdown signal to the remote computer (note: works only with Windows NT to Windows 7)
        
        5. **logoff**: Sends a logoff signal to the remote computer (note: works also only with Windows NT to Windows 7)
        
        6. **stopcontrol**: Stops the remote control immediately.
