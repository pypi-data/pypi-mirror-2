        - Show the "Reset" link on the portlet only if there's more than one metadatum (thomasw)
        - Modularised the clicksearch result display. Rather than having a hard-coded section in the template, the result

        that uses the previous template's code (thomasw)

        but always tokenized and consumed like lists.
        The Edit view for the portlet will look different. Data will be converted
        on first portlet loading (gerken)

        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        slc.clicksearch
        ===============
        
        This package provides a way to navigate using metadata, which can make sense if
        there are several different types of metadata categories which categorize the
        content. In our use case, we have Thesaurus, Category, Country, Language
        and NACE Code and about 10.000 items to filter on.
        
        It should be possible to browse the search results by clicking values from the
        different metadata. If I click a value, the search results are restricted by
        that value. If I broaden up my search again by clicking on a special link,
        this criteria is removed again.
        
        There is a ClickSearch Portlet on the left with one section for each metadata
        element. Each section has the name of the metadata element as title. Then it
        lists some of the most popular values of the metadata element as links. These
        "most populars" are configurable from within the portlet.
        
        A more link below the top values allows selecting from the total amount of
        values. Clicking on "more" turns up an extended selection page temporarily
        replacing the body area which has enough space to list all values and some
        explanation about their meaning. This is particularly useful for
        complex metadata like Thesaurus, Subcategory and NACE (several hundred entries
        or more in treeform).
        They will not be displayed as a popup any more. Instead the whole tree will be
        embedded in the page. The user selects a term and returns to the search
        results.
        
        If a user has selected an item and the search results have been narrowed down,
        he can undo this narrowing by broadening the search back again. As example
        the user clicks on "any Country" to remove the filter by country again.
        
        Customizing the widget
        ----------------------
        It is possible to customize the portlet widget. That way you can create
        a different selection meachanism depending on the index type.
        For that you need to provide a new browser page for
        Products.ATContentTypes.content.topic.ATTopic
        with the name "slc.clicksearch.%s" % INDEX_NAME where INDEX_NAME must
        be the name of the index.
        BE CAREFUL, do not use a normal browser view here, because the semantics
        of __call__ are different. __call__ gets called with two parameters, index
        and box_config. index is just the index while box_config is the configuration.
        Please see slc.clicksearch.widgets.widgets for examples
        
        
        Providing better Results
        ------------------------
        (OSHA Specific, should not be part of this package anymore later on)
        
        The result list should show the title and the first 200 characters of the
        description for each result. The object type, the creation date and the date
        of last change indicate type and freshness of the information. In addition
        the external link is displayed where the item will link to. Additional metadata
        is given like "Language", "See also" and the provider of the information.
        
        While images are not so useful in this case, an image of the linked homepage
        can be seen when moving the mouse over the remote link.
        
        This result list must then be optimised based on the results of a user search
        behaviour analysis which turns up what users are really looking for. If
        for example a certain group of users is searching by CAS Number, showing
        that number in the result list would give a benefit.
        
        
        
        Test setup
        ----------
        
        To start experimenting, do the following:
        
        - add a new topic called "Click Search"
        - configure the topic to show a subset of your data, e.g. only the links
        - On this topic add a Clicksearch portlet on the left
        - configure the portlet to show metadatum Subject and allowedUsersAndRoles
        - provide some values which you are going to use in your site
        - In ZMI set the property layout to clicksearch on the click search folder,
        this will show the result list immediately
        
        
        Add support for new indexes
        ---------------------------
        
        In this example we want to support a hierarchical multilingual thesaurus
        stored in atvocabularymanager. For that we need:
        
        * a portlet widget that shows the hierarchy
        * A show more page which gives access to the full tree
        (using VocabularyPickerWidget)
        
        Preparations
        First we need to add the vdex vocabulary file from the data folder to the
        ATVocabularyManager. Then we need to make this new metadata element
        available to the content types by schemaextending them and adding an
        index and metadata to the catalog.
