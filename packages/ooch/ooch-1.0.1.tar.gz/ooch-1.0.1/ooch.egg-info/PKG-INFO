Description: Mooching files with Python
        ==========================
        
        Sharing files on a local network made kinda easy.
        
        **Share files with:**
        
        python -mooch -s filename filename filename dirname
        
        Sharing a dirname shares all the files in that directory.
        
        **Find files to mooch with:**
        
        python -mooch
        
        **Grab a specific file with:**
        
        python -mooch filename
        
        Use python -mooch to discover the other command-line arguments, such as
        verbosity and port number controls.
        
        Current limitations:
        
        - you can't mooch and offer files on the same host
        - the interface is a bit crap
        - no support for auto-zipping files up
        - actually, no compression at all
        - and, you know, a bunch of stuff 'cos this is a toy thrown together in a
        few hours
