.TH pshbak 1 "Version 1.9"

.SH NAME
pshbak \- format output from pdsh command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pshbak
.RI [ OPTION "]... " 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pshbak
formats output from parallel shells such as 
.B pdsh 
and
.BR dsh , 
into a more readable output. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for
.BR dshbak .

Output from 
.BR pdsh ,
where each line is prefixed by a hostname followed by a colon, 
is read via stdin, collected per hostname, and printed in a
per hostname fashion. 
With the often used
.B -c
option, hosts having identical output are collected and the output is
printed only once.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
Collect hosts having identical output and make the identical output appear to 
only once. The collected hostlist representing the nodes is shown in the header before the output.
.TP
.B -d, --unified-diff
Print only the most frequent output in full. Then print any diverging output 
as a unified diff relative the most frequent output. This mode of operation 
implies the 
.B -c
option
.TP
.B -g, --with-garbage
Also print any output not conforming to the "host:output" format
in a special 
.I NON-FORMATTED OUTPUT
section before the correctly formatted data. The default mode of operation
is to silently ignore non-conforming lines.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Display a brief help message.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Collect information about the running kernel version in a \
compute cluster having  node names n1, n2, ..., n400 using pdsh and pshbak:
.B pdsh 
-w n[1-400] uname -r | 
.B pshbak 
-c

The hostlist expression syntax is used by several programs developed at 
.B LLNL
(https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/), for example
.B SLURM
(https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/) and 
.B Pdsh
(http://code.google.com/p/pdsh/).

See the
.B HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS
section of the
.BR pdsh (1)
manual page for a short introduction to the hostlist syntax.
