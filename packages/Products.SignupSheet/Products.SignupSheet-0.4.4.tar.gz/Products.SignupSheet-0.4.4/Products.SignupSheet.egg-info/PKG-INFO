Description: SignupSheet
        ===========
        
        
        SignupSheet is an add-on product that allows site managers to create custom
        registration forms for events, workshops, fundraisers and other events that
        require online registration.  Each SignupSheet defines the fields that are used
        for each Registrant object they contain, through the ATSchemaEditorNG product.
        The Registrant object is what the end user fills out and submits.  The workflow
        places each submitted Registrant in a private state once it is submitted so
        that  it can be reviewed and approved.
        
        
        The SignupSheet has these additional features:
        
        - Registrant fields can be exported to CSV
        
        - A waiting list and event size can be set, end users are emailed a message
        stating whether they are pending approval or on the waiting list.
        
        - The signup sheet view indicates whether the SignupSheet is 'full', 'open' or
        whether user will be put on a  waiting list. This is calculated using the
        event size and waiting list settings.
        
        - End user is directed to a customizable thank you page.
        
        
        The key motivation behind this product is to provides a way for site managers
        to setup registration forms that do more than email the fields to an address.
        Having the fields be configurable is essential, since many groups have specific
        requirements for the data they are collecting for their events.
        
        
        SignupSheet is released under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2.

        Known Issues and Potential Improvements
        ---------------------------------------
        
        - Signupsheet needs more explanatory text.  Schema editor has been simplified
        but needs better explanatory text.
        
        - It is possible to prematurely fill up registration by malicious user.

        -----
        - updates to make Plone 3.0.6 compatible.
        - added tests for email and posting workflow
        - bulk of Plone 3 compatibility work done by Radmin Novotny
        
        
        0.2.0 Beta
        ----------
        Andreas Jung and Radim Novotny contributed significantly to this release.
        
        - added Portuguese Brasilian translation. Thanks Vitor Reis.
        - added 'view registrants' that displays current registrants status and allows for confirming and editing registrants
        - added i18n support for templates
        - added German translation
        - updated tests to pass
        - updated i18n
        - Because thank_you_page and email_response fields were changed from TextField
        to ZPTField it is necessary to manually run migration code from
        Extensions/migrate method fixZPTFields. This method will read
        old values from these two fields and store the same value in new format.
        WARNING: if you don't run migration you will get AttributeError: read
        when accessing old SignupSheet objects
        - It is possible to generate HTML emails
        - workflow script sendInitialEmail is called *before* the transition,
        because anonymous can access registrant object only in 'new' state.
        If script will be called after transition, Registrant.sendNotificationMail
        method won't have access to registrant object. Access is required due to
        rendering templates from ZPTField.
        - removed signupsheet_email_* templates
        - Introduced TALESField and TemplateFields dependecy. SignupSheet uses
        these two fields for scripting thank_you_page, confirmation and
        notification email (subject and message).
        Syntax is described in field help text::
        
        context = SignupSheet
        options/registrant = current Registrant object
        
        - added notifyEmail field to signupsheet schema. It allows to send notification
        about new registrant to some email address.
        - removed registration of SignupSheet.css from portal_css
        - it is possible to use options/computed_text in email template now
        - use getSiteEncoding if available
        - additional i18n work (signupsheet.py - schema)
        - improved i18n catalogs, added Czech translation
        - do not depend on Kupu in install code
        - replaced dtml templates with ZPT with i18n
        - use base_view for SignupSheet and simplified signupsheet_view template
        
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        - fixed bug that caused editing existing Registrant objects to fail
        - added import for ATSENG so test run properly
        - fixed incorrect security declaration for registrantFieldNames
        
        0.1
        ---
        - Installs ATSENG dependency
        - Fixed bug for computing status, added tests against bug
        - Fixed manager can override initial post state
        - Registrant edit page displays title of SignupSheet
        - Fixed Thank you message renders proper HTML
        - Fixed email response so that it is text only
