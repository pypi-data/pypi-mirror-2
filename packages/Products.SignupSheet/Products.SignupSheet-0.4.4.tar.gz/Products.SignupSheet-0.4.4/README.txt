SignupSheet
===========


SignupSheet is an add-on product that allows site managers to create custom
registration forms for events, workshops, fundraisers and other events that
require online registration.  Each SignupSheet defines the fields that are used
for each Registrant object they contain, through the ATSchemaEditorNG product.
The Registrant object is what the end user fills out and submits.  The workflow
places each submitted Registrant in a private state once it is submitted so
that  it can be reviewed and approved.  

  
The SignupSheet has these additional features:
 
- Registrant fields can be exported to CSV
  
- A waiting list and event size can be set, end users are emailed a message
  stating whether they are pending approval or on the waiting list.  
  
- The signup sheet view indicates whether the SignupSheet is 'full', 'open' or
  whether user will be put on a  waiting list. This is calculated using the
  event size and waiting list settings.
  
- End user is directed to a customizable thank you page.

  
The key motivation behind this product is to provides a way for site managers
to setup registration forms that do more than email the fields to an address.
Having the fields be configurable is essential, since many groups have specific
requirements for the data they are collecting for their events. 

    
SignupSheet is released under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2.
