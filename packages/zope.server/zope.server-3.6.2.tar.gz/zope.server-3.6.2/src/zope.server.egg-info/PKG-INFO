Description: This package contains generic base classes for channel-based servers, the
        servers themselves and helper objects, such as tasks and requests.
        
        ============
        WSGI Support
        ============
        
        `zope.server`'s HTTP server comes with WSGI_ support.
        ``zope.server.http.wsgihttpserver.WSGIHTTPServer`` can act as a WSGI gateway.
        There's also an entry point for PasteDeploy_ that lets you use zope.server's
        WSGI gateway from a configuration file, e.g.::
        
          [server:main]
          use = egg:zope.server
          host = 127.0.0.1
          port = 8080
        
        .. _WSGI: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/
