Summary: Middleware that extracts {% block-s %} from pages and sends them as JSON. This allows the clients update parts of the pages, which is useful for Ajax apps and sites using History.PushState.
    
    If /mypage/ has {% block main_content %} in the template, make a request /mypage/?partial=main_content, and you'll receive a JSON: {"main_content": "..."}.
