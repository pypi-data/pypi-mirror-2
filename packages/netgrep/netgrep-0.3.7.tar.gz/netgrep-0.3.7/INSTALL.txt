Installation
============

Quick install:
--------------

Method 1

Use of easy_install / pip is recommended:

$ sudo easy_install netgrep

Method 2

If you don't want to use pip, you can extract the tarball from 
https://github.com/csirtfoundry/netgrep/tarball/master and then:

$ sudo python setup.py install

Detailed install:
-----------------

If the above didn't work, here's what you can do.

You'll need:

adns (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/)
Python libraries:
  BulkWhois
  publicsuffix
  adns-python

Here's some OS-specific ways to install the prerequisites and netgrep,
assuming a clean system:

* 1: Linux install with apt-get:

$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools gcc python-dev python-adns
$ sudo easy_install netgrep

* 2: OS X install:

Using homebrew (or your choice of package manager):

Install Xcode (needed for building lots of Homebrew packages)
$ brew install adns
$ sudo easy_install pip
$ sudo pip install netgrep

* 3: Download and extract the tarball and then (with apt-get):

$ sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev python-setuptools python-adns
$ sudo python setup.py install

* Windows

Untested, and suspect it may not work. If you like to report how it did or
didn't work, please let me know.

Installation issues:
--------------------

When installing adns-python, you may receive:

adnsmodule.c:8:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory

sudo apt-get install python-dev
