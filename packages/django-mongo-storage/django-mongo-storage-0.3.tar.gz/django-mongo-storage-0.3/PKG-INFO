Description: 
        A helper app for using MongoDB's GridFS as a storage backend for django.
        
        mongo_storage contents include:
        
        models.py
          - MongoFileMixin: a model mixin creating a MongoFileField called content
          - MongoDeleteFileMixin: a model mixin that will delete the underlying
            file when the model is deleted
        
        fields.py
          - MongoFileField: a custom file field that gives you access to the
            file name through a 'file_name' property. Useful because the
            GridFSStorage makes Django store the MongoDB ObjectId instead
            of the file name.
        
        storage.py
          - GridFSStorage: the Django storage module to interact with the pymongo,
            MongoDB's python adapters
        
        admin.py
          - MongoFileAdminMixin: gives the ModelAdmin access to the stored
            file's file name and file size.
          - DeleteActionMixin: allows ModelAdmin to call the delete method on
            each model being deleted (so the underlying file will be delete
            also) when deleting items in bulk.
        
        Dependencies:
          - mongodb Database
          - pymongo
          - django
