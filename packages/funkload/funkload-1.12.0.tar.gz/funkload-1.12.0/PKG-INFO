Description: FunkLoad is a functional and load web tester, written in Python, whose
        main use cases are:
        
        * Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.
        
        * Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring
          your servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed
          report of performance measurement.
        
        * Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
          like volume testing or longevity testing.
        
        * Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test
          the application recoverability.
        
        * Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
          a site is alive.
        
        
        Main FunkLoad features are:
        
        * FunkLoad is free software distributed under the `GNU GPL`_.
        
        * Functional test are pure Python scripts using the pyUnit framework like
          normal unit test. Python enable complex scenarios to handle real world
          applications.
        
        * Truly emulates a web browser (single-threaded) using Richard Jones'
          webunit_:
        
          - basic authentication support
          - cookies support
          - referrer support
          - fetching css, javascript and images
          - emulating a browser cache
          - file upload and multipart/form-data submission
          - post any kind of content type like ``application/xml``
          - https support
          - http_proxy support
        
        * Advanced test runner with many command-line options:
        
          - set the target server url
          - display the fetched page in real time in your browser
          - debug mode
          - check performance of a single page (or set of pages) inside a test
          - green/red color mode
          - select or exclude tests cases using a regex
          - support normal pyUnit test
          - support doctest from a plain text file or embedded in python docstring
        
        * Turn a functional test into a load test: just by invoking the bench runner
          you can identify scalability and performance problems.
        
        * Detailed bench reports in ReST or HTML (and PDF via ps2pdf)
          containing:
        
          - the bench configuration
          - tests, pages, requests stats and charts.
          - the 5 slowest requests.
          - monitoring one or many servers cpu usage, load average, memory/swap
            usage and network traffic charts.
          - an http error summary list
        
          View a `report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6/>`.
        
        * Differential reports to compare 2 bench reports giving a quick overview of
          scalability and velocity changes.
          View a `diff report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/diff_seam_java_6_vs_5/>`.
        
        * Easy test customization using a configuration file or command line options.
        
        * Easy test creation using embeded TCPWatch as proxy recorder, so you can
          use your web browser and produce a FunkLoad test automatically, including
          file upload or any ajax call.
        
        * Provides web assertion helpers to check expected results in responses.
        
        * Provides helpers to retrieve contents in responses page using DOM.
        
        * Provides a funkload.CPSTestCase to ease Zope and Nuxeo CPS testing.
        
        * Easy to install (EasyInstall_) and use, see examples in the demo folder.
        
        * Works fine with CPS or any Zope application, CherryPy, Nuxeo EP or any
          JBoss Seam JSF MyFaces applications ...
