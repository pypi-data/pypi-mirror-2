Getting help
=============

The list of open tasks and bugs is listed into an `org-mode
<http://orgmode.org>`_  TODO_ file. (The trac is deprecated
http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/report/12 since 1.14.0).

If you want to report a bug or if you think that something is
missing, send me an email: bdelbosc _at_ nuxeo.com.

This process will be improved after the GitHub migration.
