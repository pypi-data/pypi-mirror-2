    long_description="""\
FunkLoad is a functional and load web tester, written in Python, whose
main use cases are:

* Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.

* Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring
  your servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed
  report of performance measurement.

* Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
  like volume testing or longevity testing.

* Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test
  the application recoverability.

* Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
  a site is alive.


Main FunkLoad features are:

* FunkLoad is free software distributed under the `GNU GPL`_.

* Functional test are pure Python scripts using the pyUnit framework like
  normal unit test. Python enable complex scenarios to handle real world
  applications.

* Truly emulates a web browser (single-threaded) using Richard Jones'
  webunit_:

  - basic authentication support
  - cookies support
  - referrer support
  - fetching css, javascript and images
  - emulating a browser cache
  - file upload and multipart/form-data submission
  - post any kind of content type like ``application/xml``
  - https support
  - http_proxy support

* Advanced test runner with many command-line options:

  - set the target server url
  - display the fetched page in real time in your browser
  - debug mode
  - check performance of a single page (or set of pages) inside a test
  - green/red color mode
  - select or exclude tests cases using a regex
  - support normal pyUnit test
  - support doctest from a plain text file or embedded in python docstring

* Turn a functional test into a load test: just by invoking the bench
  runner you can identify scalability and performance problems. If
  needed the bench can distributed over a group of worker machines.

* Detailed bench reports in ReST or HTML (and PDF via ps2pdf)
  containing:

  - the bench configuration
  - tests, pages, requests stats and charts.
  - the 5 slowest requests.
  - monitoring one or many servers cpu usage, load average, memory/swap
    usage and network traffic charts.
  - an http error summary list

  View a `report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6/>`.

* Differential reports to compare 2 bench reports giving a quick overview of
  scalability and velocity changes.
  View a `diff report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/diff_seam_java_6_vs_5/>`.

* Easy test customization using a configuration file or command line options.

* Easy test creation using embeded TCPWatch as proxy recorder, so you can
  use your web browser and produce a FunkLoad test automatically, including
  file upload or any ajax call.

* Provides web assertion helpers to check expected results in responses.

* Provides helpers to retrieve contents in responses page using DOM.

* Provides a funkload.CPSTestCase to ease Zope and Nuxeo CPS testing.

* Easy to install (EasyInstall_) and use, see examples in the demo folder.

* Works fine with CPS or any Zope application, CherryPy, Nuxeo EP or any
  JBoss Seam JSF MyFaces applications ...
