Introducing FunkLoad
====================

Since FunkLoad 1.14.0 The main documentation is moving to Sphinx, the
work is in progress but it already contains more information than this
current documentation, you may be interested in looking at the draft:
http://funkload.nuxeo.org/sphinx/. Thanks.


What is FunkLoad ?
------------------

FunkLoad_ is a functional and load web tester, written in Python, whose
main use cases are:

* Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.

* Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring
  your servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed
  report of performance measurement.

* Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
  like volume testing or longevity testing.

* Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test
  the application recoverability.

* Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
  a site is alive.


Main FunkLoad_ features are:

* FunkLoad_ is free software distributed under the `GNU GPL`_.

* Functional test are pure Python scripts using the pyUnit_ framework like
  normal unit test. Python enable complex scenarios to handle real world
  applications.

* Truly emulates a web browser (single-threaded) using an enhanced Richard
  Jones' webunit_:

  - basic authentication support
  - cookies support
  - referrer support
  - fetching css, javascript and images
  - emulating a browser cache
  - file upload and multipart/form-data submission
  - post any kind of content type like ``application/xml``
  - https support
  - https with ssl/tls by providing a private key and certificate (PEM
    formatted)
  - http_proxy support

* Advanced test runner with many command-line options:

  - set the target server url
  - display the fetched page in real time in your browser
  - debug mode to display http headers
  - check performance of a single page (or set of pages) inside a test
  - green/red color mode
  - select or exclude tests cases using a regex
  - support normal pyUnit_ test
  - support doctest_ from a plain text file or embedded in python docstring

* Turn a functional test into a load test: just by invoking the bench runner
  you can identify scalability and performance problems.

* Detailed bench reports in ReST or HTML (and PDF via ps2pdf)
  containing:

  - the bench configuration
  - tests, pages, requests stats and charts.
  - the 5 slowest requests.
  - monitoring one or many servers cpu usage, load average, memory/swap
    usage and network traffic charts.
  - an http error summary list

  View a `report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/test_seam_java6/>`_.

* Differential reports to compare 2 bench reports giving a quick overview of
  scalability and velocity changes.
  View a `diff report example <http://funkload.nuxeo.org/report-example/diff_seam_java_6_vs_5/>`_.

* Easy test customization using a configuration file or command line options.

* Easy test creation using embeded TCPWatch_ as proxy recorder, so you can
  use your web browser and produce a FunkLoad_ test automatically, including
  file upload or any ajax call.

* Provides web assertion helpers to check expected results in responses.

* Provides helpers to retrieve contents in responses page using DOM.

* Provides a funkload.CPSTestCase to ease Zope_ and Nuxeo_ CPS_ testing.

* Easy to install (EasyInstall_) and use, see examples in the demo_ folder.

* Works fine with CPS or any Zope application, CherryPy, Nuxeo EP or any
  JBoss Seam JSF MyFaces applications ...

contributors_.


Test runner
===========

A FunkLoad_ test can be used like a standard unittest using a unittest.main()
and a 'python MyFile.py'.

To ease testing FunkLoad_ come with an advanced test runner to override
the static configuration file.

The ``loop-on-pages`` option enable to check response time of some specific
pages inside a test without changing the script, which make easy to tune a
page in a complex context. Use the ``debug`` option to find the page numbers.

Note that ``fl-run-test`` can be used to launch normal unittest.TestCase and
(if you use python2.4) doctest_ in a plain text file or embedded in a python
docstring. The ``--debug`` option makes doctests verbose.


Usage
-----
::

  fl-run-test [options] file [class.method|class|suite] [...]


Examples
--------
::

  fl-run-test myFile.py
                        Run all tests (including doctest with python2.4).

Benching
========

The same FunkLaod test can be turned into a load test, just by invoking the
bench runner ``fl-run-bench``.

Principle
---------

Here are some definitions used in bench mode:

* CUs: Concurrent Users, which is the number of threads.
* STPS: Average of Successful Tests Per Second during a cycle.
* SPPS: Average of Successfully Page Per Second during a cycle.
* RPS: Average Request Per Second, successfully or not.
* max[STPS|SPPS|RPS]: maximum of STPS|SPPS|RPS for a cycle.

Page
~~~~

A page is an http get/post request with associated sub requests like
redirects, images or links (css, js files). This is what users see as a
single page.


Test
~~~~

A test is made with 3 methods: setUp/test_name/tearDown. During the test_name
method each get/post request is called a page.

::

  [setUp][page 1]    [page 2] ... [page n]   [tearDown]
  ======================================================> time
         <----------------------------------> test method
                 <--> sleeptime_min to sleeptime_max
         <-----> page 1 connection time

Cycle
~~~~~

A cycle is a load of n concurrents test during a 'duration' period.
Threads are launched every 'startupdelay' seconds, each thread executes
test in a loop.

Once all threads have been started we start to record stats.

Only tests that end during the 'duration' period are taken into account
for the test stats (in the representation below test like [---X are not
take into account).

Only pages and requests that finish during the 'duration' are taken into
account for the request and pages statistic

Before a cycle a setUpCycle method is called, after a cycle a tearDownCycle
method is called, you can use these methods to test differents server
configuration for each cycle.

              <-> startupdelay    <---> sleeptime


Cycles
~~~~~~

FunkLoad_ can execute many cycles with different number of CUs, this way you
can find easily the maximum number of users that your application can
handle.

Running n cycles with the same CUs is a good way to see how the application
handles a writing test over time.

Running n cycles with the same CUs with a reading test and a setUpCycle that
change the application configuration will help you to find the right tuning.

Tips
----

Here are few remarks/advices to obtain workable metrics.

* Since it uses significant CPU resources, make sure that performance limits
  are not hit by FunkLoad_ before your server's limit is reached.
  Check this by launching a bench from another host.

* Having a cycle with one user gives a usefull reference.

* A bench is composed of a benching test (or scenario) run many times. A good
  benching test should not be too long so you have a higher testing rate (that
  is, more benching tests can come to their end).

* The cycle duration for the benching test should be long enough.
  Around 5 times the duration of a single benching test is a value that is
  usually a safe bet. You can obtain this duration of a single benching test by
  running ``fl-run-test myfile.py MyTestCase.testSomething``.

  Rationale : Normally a cycle duration of a single benching test should be
  enough. But from the testing platform side if there are more than one
  concurrent user, there are many threads to start and it takes some time. And on
  from the tested platform side it is common that a benching test will last
  longer and longer as the server is used by more and more users.

* You should use many cycles with the same step interval to produce readable
  charts (1:10:20:30:40:50:60 vs 1:10:100)

* A benching test must have the same number of page and in the same
  order.

* Use a Makefile to make reproductible bench.

* There is no debug option while doing a bench (since this would be illegible
  with all the threads). So, if a bench fails (that is using `fl-run-bench`),
  use ``fl-run-test -d`` to debug.

* Using `fl-record` is very easy and very fast to create a scenario. But since
  it doesn't support HTTPS, the good practise is to first record a scenario
  with `fl-record` on HTTP, and then change the `url` back to `https` in your
  FunkLoad test configuration file.

* Always use description in post/get/put/delete/xmlrpc, this improves the
  readability of the report.


Bench report
============

To produce an HTML or ReST report you need to invoke the ``fl-build-report``,
you can easily produce PDF report using Firefox 'Print To File' in
PostScript then use the ps2pdf converter.

Usage
-----
::

  fl-build-report [options] xmlfile

``fl-build-report`` analyze a FunkLoad_ bench xml result file and output a
report.


Examples
--------
::

  fl-build-report funkload.xml
                        ReST rendering into stdout.
  fl-build-report --html -o /tmp funkload.xml
                        Build an HTML report in /tmp.
  fl-build-report --diff /tmp/test_reader-20080101 /tmp/test_reader-20080102
                        Build a differential report to compare 2 bench reports,
                        requires gnuplot.
  fl-build-report -h
                        More options.

Options
-------
::

    --version               show program's version number and exit
    --help, -h              show this help message and exit
    --html, -H              Produce an html report.
    --with-percentiles, -P  Include percentiles in tables, use 10%, 50% and 90%
                        for charts, default option.
    --no-percentiles        No percentiles in tables display min, avg and max in
                        charts (gdchart only).
    --diff, -d              Create differential report.
    --output-directory=OUTPUT_DIR, -o OUTPUT_DIR
                        Parent directory to store reports.

 Note that you can preview the report for cycles that have been done while
 the bench is still running by invoking the above command.



Test Recorder
=============


Recording a new FunkLoad test
-----------------------------

Starting with FunkLoad_ 1.3.0 you can use ``fl-record`` to record your
navigator activity, this requires the TCPWatch_ python proxy see INSTALL_
for information on how to install TCPWatch_.

1. Start the recorder::

    fl-record basic_navigation


  This will output something like this::

    Hit Ctrl-C to stop recording.
    HTTP proxy listening on :8090
    Recording to directory /tmp/tmpaYDky9_funkload.


2. Setup your browser proxy and play your scenario

  * in Firefox: Edit > Preferencies > General; Connection Settings set
    `localhost:8090` as your HTTP proxy

  * Play your scenario using your navigator

  * Hit Ctrl-C to stop recording::

      ^C
      # Saving uploaded file: foo.png
      # Saving uploaded file: bar.pdf
      Creating script: ./test_BasicNavigation.py.
      Creating configuration file: ./BasicNavigation.conf.


3. Replay you scenario::

     fl-run-test -dV test_BasicNavigation.py

  You should see all the steps on your navigator.

4. Implement the dynamic part and assertion

  * Code the dynamic part like getting new url of a created document
  * Add assertion using FunkLoad_ helpers
  * Use a credential server if you want to make a bench with different users
    or simply don't want to hard code your login/password.


Note that ``fl-record`` works fine with multi-part encoded form and file upload
but will failed to record https session.

Note that ``fl-record`` will handle automaticly JSF Myfaces token, which
enable to easily record and play any JBoss Seam application.


The fl-record command
---------------------

Usage
~~~~~
::

    fl-record [options] [test_name]

  fl-record launch a TCPWatch_ proxy and record activities, then output
  a FunkLoad script or generates a FunkLoad unit test if test_name is specified.
  The default proxy port is 8090.

  Note that tcpwatch.py executable must be accessible from your env.


Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

  fl-record foo_bar
                        Run a proxy and create a FunkLoad test case,
                        generates test_FooBar.py and FooBar.conf file.
                        To test it:  fl-run-test -dV test_FooBar.py
  fl-record -p 9090
                        Run a proxy on port 9090, output script to stdout.
  fl-record -i /tmp/tcpwatch
                        Convert a tcpwatch capture into a script.

Options
~~~~~~~
::

  --version               show program's version number and exit
  --help, -h              show this help message and exit
  --verbose, -v           Verbose output
  --port=PORT, -pPORT     The proxy port.
  --tcp-watch-input=TCPWATCH_PATH, -iTCPWATCH_PATH
                          Path to an existing tcpwatch capture.


Credential server
=================

If you are writing a bench that requires to be logged with different users
FunkLoad_ provides an xmlrpc credential server to serve login/pwd between the
different threads.

It requires 2 files (like unix /etc/passwd and /etc/group) the password file
have the following format::

  login1:pwd1
  ...

The group file format is::

  group1:user1, user2
  group2:user2
  # you can split group declaration
  group1:user3
  ...

Setup a configuration file like in the demo_/cmf folder, then start the
credential server::

  fl-credential-ctl credential.conf start

More options::

  fl-credential-ctl --help

See the funkload-demo/cmf example for a credential configuration file.


Monitor server
==============

If you want to monitor a linux server health during the bench, you have to
run a monitor xmlrpc server on the target server, this require to install
the FunkLoad_ package.

On the server side you need to install the FunkLoad_ tool then launch the
server using a configuration file (example in the demo_/simple folder.)::

  fl-monitor-ctl monitor.conf start

  # more info
  fl-monitor-ctl --help


On the bench host side setup your test configuration like this::

  [monitor]
  hosts = server.to.test.com

  [server.to.test.com]
  description = The web server
  port = 8008

Then run the bench, the report will include server stats.

Note that you can monitor multiple hosts and that the monitor is linux
specific.


The FunkLoadTestCase
====================

FunkLoadTestCase extends the pyUnit_ unittest.TestCase with browser
capabilities, configuration file helpers and assertions helpers. FunkLoad_
provides also some tools to generate random inputs and communicate with
credential servers.

Here is an overview of the api, you can find more on

Browser API
-----------

get
~~~
::

  get(url, params=None, description=None, ok_codes=None)

This emulates a browser http GET link. It will fetch the url, submits
appropriate cookies, follow redirection, register new cookies, load css and
javascript.

It also simulates a browser cache by not reloading a css, a javascript or an
image twice.

Note that this is an emulation with some limitation:

* It is single threaded, it loads images one after the other.
* It does not interpret javascript.
* It does not load background images.
* It does not load frames.

This method returns a webunit_ HTTPResponse.


Parameters:

- *url* a valid url
- *params* a dico of parameters that going to be append to the url like
  `url?key1=value1&...`
- *description* is used on the bench report to describe the user action
- *ok_codes* is a list of http expected code like [200:301] if the http
  response is not in the list `get` will raise a test failure exception,
  if not provided assume that the default list is [200, 301, 302].

Note that if the *url* already contains encoded parameters you should not
use the *params* parameter.


post
~~~~
::

  post(url, params=None, description=None, ok_codes=None)


Same interface than the get() but it uses a http post method.
You can upload a file by setting a params like this::

  from webunit.utility import Upload
  params['file_up'] = Upload('/tmp/foo.txt')

You can even post any contents like this (available since 1.9.0)::

  from funkload.utils import Data
  params = Data('text/xml', "<?xml version='1.0'?><methodCall><methodName>getStatus</methodName><params></params></methodCall>")
  self.post(server_url, params, description="Simulate an xmlrpc call")


exists
~~~~~~
::

  exists(url, params=None, description="Checking existence")


Return True if the http response code is 200, 301 or 302, and return False if
http code is 404 or 503, other codes will raise a test failure exception.


setBasicAuth
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

  setBasicAuth(login, password)

Next requests will use the http basic authentication.


clearBasicAuth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

  clearBasicAuth()

Remove basic auth credential set by setBasicAuth.


setUserAgent
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

  setUserAgent(agent)

New in 1.3.0. version.

Set a ``User-Agent`` http header for the next requests, the default browser
behaviour is to use the agent defined in the configuration file under
``[main] user_agent`` or to use the default ``FunkLoad/version``
string. Using this method enable to change the user agent during a test
case.


addHeader
~~~~~~~~~
::

  addHeader(key, value)

New in 1.3.0. version.

Add an http header for the next requests.


clearHeaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

  clearHeaders()

New in 1.3.0. version.

Remove all headers previously added by `addHeader`_ or `setUserAgent`_,
and remove the referer as well.

debugHeaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

  debugHeaders()

New in 1.11.0. version.

Display headers sent to the server for the next get or post request.


XML RPC API
-----------

You can test or bench xmlrpc services using the following API.

xmlrpc
~~~~~~
::

  xmlrpc(url, method_name, params=None, description=None)

Call the ``method_name`` at ``url`` using xmlrpclib. You can use the
setBasicAuth_ method before to handle the http basic authentication. Note
that due to xmlrpclib limitation you can not use an http proxy.

Parameters:

- *url* the url of the xmlrpc server
- *method_name* the name of the procedure to call
- *params* a list of parameters to pass to the method
- *description* is used on the bench report to describe the action


Assertion helpers API
---------------------

FunkLoad_ uses the unittest assertion (``assert_``, ``assertEquals``,
``fail``, ...), but provides some methods to check the http response.
After fetching a page you can use the following methods.


getLastUrl
~~~~~~~~~~
::

  getLastUrl()

Return the last accessed page url taking care of redirects.


getLastBaseUrl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

  getLastBaseUrl()

Return the <base /> href value of the last accessed page.


listHref
~~~~~~~~
::

  listHref(url_pattern=None, content_pattern=None):

Return a list of href anchor url present in the last html response,
filtering href using the ``url_pattern`` regex if present and filtering the
text content of the link with content_pattern if present.


getBody
~~~~~~~
::

  getBody()

Return the last response content.


The response object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response returned by a get or post are webunit_ HTTPResponse object

::

  response = self.get(url)
  print "http response code %s" % response.code
  print "http header location %s" % response.headers['location']
  self.assert_('HTML' in response.body)

::

  response.getDOM().getByName('h1')

getDOM return a SimpleDOM interface of the fetched html page, see the
webunit_ SimpleDOM api instructions for details.



Configuration file API
----------------------

A FunkLoadTestCase class uses a configuration file to setup variable
configuration, like the base server url to be tested, the test description,
credential access, logging files and other test specific parameters. The test
configuration file have the same name of the FunkLoadTestCase with a '.conf'
extension. See documented examples in the demo_ folder (``fl-install-demo``).

conf_get
~~~~~~~~
::

  conf_get(section, key, default=_marker)

Return an entry from the configuration file. Note that the entry may be
overriden by a command line option.

Parameters:

- *section* the section in the configuration file.
- *key* the key.
- *default* a default value.

Logging
-------

A FunkLoadTestCase store its results in an xml file (like request and test
result) and put other log information into a text log and/or output to the
console.

logd

::

  logd(message)

Debug log message

logi
~~~~
::
