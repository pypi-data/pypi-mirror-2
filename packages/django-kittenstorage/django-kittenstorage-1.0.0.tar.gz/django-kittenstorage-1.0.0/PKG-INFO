        ====================
        kittenstorage is a so called *development storage engine*.
        
        Many people have the problem with gigantomanic production databases with 
        gigabytes of pictures/files. It is a pain to keep the image files synchronised 
        between development and production environments. 
        
        Therefore I have written this storage engine. In case a file is not found, 
        an image from placekitten.com_ will be used/displayed
        instead.
        
        Setup
        =====
        It's on pypi.
        
            ``pip install django-kittenstorage``
        
        Feel free to clone from github too. Forking is welcome as well :-)
        
        In your django settings file:
        
            ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'kittenstorage.storages.GreyKitten'``
        
        Storage Engines
        ===============
        kittenstorage offers two engines:
        
        1. ``kittenstorage.storages.GreyKitten``
        2. ``kittenstorage.storages.ColorKitten``
        
        Choose depending on the saturation you want. I prefer ``GreyKitten`` since it 
        does have a pretty classy look.
        
        Settings
        ========
        There is only one setting:
        
        KITTEN_SIZE  
            Default: ``(1024, 1024)``
        
            A tuple of format `(width, height)`, specifiying the size of the image 
            requested from placekitten__.
        
        
        .. _placekitten.com: http://placekitten.com/
        __ placekitten.com_
