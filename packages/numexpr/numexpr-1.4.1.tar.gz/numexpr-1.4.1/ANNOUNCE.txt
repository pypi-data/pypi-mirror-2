==========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.4.1
==========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

What's new
==========

This is a maintenance release.  On it, several improvements have been
done in order to prevent deadlocks in new threaded code (fixes #33).
Also the GIL is released now during computations, which should be
interesting for embedding numexpr in threaded Python apps.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:

or have a look at RELEASE_NOTES.txt in the tarball.

Where I can find Numexpr?
