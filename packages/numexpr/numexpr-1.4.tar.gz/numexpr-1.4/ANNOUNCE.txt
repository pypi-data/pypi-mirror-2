========================
 Announcing Numexpr 1.4
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

What's new
==========

The main improvement in this version is the support for
multi-threading in pure C.  Threading in C provides the best
performance in nowadays multi-core machines.  In addition, this avoids
the GIL that hampers performance in many Python apps.

Just to wet your appetite, look into this page where the
implementation is briefly described and where some benchmarks are
shown:

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:

or have a look at RELEASE_NOTES.txt in the tarball.
