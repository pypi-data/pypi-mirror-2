Description: Goto Dir
        ========
        
        Default shortcut ``<crtl>+<alt>+l`` opens editor file directory in file manager.
        
        Problems
        --------
        
        Because plugin uses ``xdg-open`` for opening directory you must
        have ``mimeopen`` util installed in your system, or else directory will be
        opened in Firefox.
        
        AFAIK, debian based distributives have ``mimeopen`` from the box. For ArchLinux
        you need install ``perl-file-mimeinfo`` package.
