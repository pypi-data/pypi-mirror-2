Description: 
        Pebl is a python library and command line application for learning the
        structure of a Bayesian network given prior knowledge and observations.  Pebl
        includes the following features:
        
        * Can learn with observational and interventional data
        * Handles missing values and hidden variables using exact and heuristic
        methods
        * Provides several learning algorithms; makes creating new ones simple
        * Supports hard and soft structural priors
        * Has facilities for transparent parallel execution
        * Calculates edge marginals and consensus networks
        * Presents results in a variety of formats
