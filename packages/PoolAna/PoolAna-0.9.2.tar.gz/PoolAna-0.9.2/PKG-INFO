Description: ========
        Pool Ana
        ========
        
        Pool Ana is a python package that helps you organize and run your analysis
        code.  It principally supports an analysis style in which you write short,
        simple pieces of code that compute one thing for each event and store it in
        friend trees of the original input trees.  When running the code, the input
        dataset is split up into a (sometimes large) number of sections of a certain
        number of events each, and then each section is submitted to a pool of worker
        processes.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        I suggest using virtualenv and pip to install this in your home area::
        
        ~$ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.4.6.tar.gz
        ~$ tar xvzf virtualenv-1.4.6.tar.gz
        ~$ python virtualenv-1.4.6/virtualenv.py --distribute my-ana
        ~$ . my-ana/bin/activate  # You must be in bash for this work properly!
        ~$ pip install PoolAna
        
        Now build your analysis code inside the my-ana directory, and always activate
        the my-ana virtual environment to run it.
