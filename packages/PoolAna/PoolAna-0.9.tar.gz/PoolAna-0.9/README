Pool Ana
========

Pool Ana is a python package that helps you organize and run your analysis
code.  It principally supports an analysis style in which you write short,
simple pieces of code that compute one thing for each event and store it in
friend trees of the original input trees.  When running the code, the input
dataset is split up into a (sometimes large) number of sections of a certain
number of events each, and then each section is submitted to a pool of worker
processes.
