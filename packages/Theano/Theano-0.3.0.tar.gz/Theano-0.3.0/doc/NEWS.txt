Theano 0.1
==========

*Release date: 2009-04-02*

What works
----------

- building symbolic expression.
- arranging symbolic expressions into Modules so that multiple functions
  can work on the same data.
- symbolic gradient descent.
- graph optimization.
- compilation to C for many kinds of expression.
- a debugging mode that checks that your expression results are correct,
  using a variety of sanity checks.

What's missing?
---------------

- An algorithm library. We're missing a library of examples and standard
  component implementations.  Some examples will find their way into
  the Theano repo, but standard algorithms will go into the 'pylearn'
  project (toolbox style). Now that we have a stable foundation, we
  can reach a consensus on style for algorithms.
