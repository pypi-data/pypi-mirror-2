Welcome
=======

Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays efficiently. Theano features:

* **tight integration with numpy** -- Use `numpy.ndarray` in Theano-compiled functions.
* **transparent use of a GPU** -- Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
* **efficient symbolic differentiation** -- Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.
* **speed and stability optimizations** -- Get the right answer for ``log(1+x)`` even when ``x`` is really tiny.
* **dynamic C code generation** -- Evaluate expressions faster.
* **extensive unit-testing and self-verification** -- Detect and diagnose many types of mistake.

Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific investigations
since 2007.  But it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom
(IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).

Download
========

Theano is now `available on PyPI`_, and can be installed via ``easy_install
Theano``, or by downloading and unpacking the tarball and typing ``python
setup.py install``.

Those interested in bleeding-edge features should obtain the latest development 
version, available via::

    hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/theano Theano

You can then place the checkout directory on your ``$PYTHONPATH`` or use
``python setup.py develop`` to install a ``.pth`` into your ``site-packages``
directory, so that when you pull updates via Mercurial they will be
automatically reflected the "installed" version. For more information about
installation and configuration, see :ref:`installing Theano <install>`.

Documentation
=============

Roughly in order of what you'll want to check out:

* :ref:`install` -- How to install Theano.
* :ref:`introduction` -- What is Theano?
* :ref:`tutorial` -- Learn the basics.
* :ref:`libdoc` -- Theano's functionality, module by module.
* :ref:`optimizations` -- Guide to Theano's graph optimizations.
* :ref:`extending` -- Learn to add a Type, Op, or graph optimization.
* :ref:`internal` -- How to maintaining Theano, LISA-specific tips, and more...
* :ref:`release` -- How our release should work.

You can download the latest `PDF documentation <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/theano.pdf>`_, rather than reading it online.

Check out how Theano can be used for Machine Learning: `Deep Learning Tutorials <http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial>`_.

Theano was featured at `SciPy 2010 <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/461>`_.

    "Thank YOU for correcting it so quickly. I wish all packages I worked
    with would have such an active maintenance - this is as good as it
    gets :-)"
