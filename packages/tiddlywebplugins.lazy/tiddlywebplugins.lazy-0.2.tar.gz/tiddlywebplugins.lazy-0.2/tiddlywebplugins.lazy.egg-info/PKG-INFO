Description: This is an experimental TiddlyWeb plugin to do loading of tiddlers after
        the tiddlywiki has initially booted.
        
        It's goal is to lower the amount of data transferred in the first
        request.
        
        It needs http://github.com/cdent/lazytiddlers/blob/master/LazyTiddlersPlugin.js
        to operate. It is not currently packaged with the plugin because of
        difficulties with tiddlywebplugins.instancer.
        
        
Platform: Posix; MacOS X; Windows
