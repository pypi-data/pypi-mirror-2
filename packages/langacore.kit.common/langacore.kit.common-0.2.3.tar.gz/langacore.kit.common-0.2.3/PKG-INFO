Description: --------------------
        langacore.kit.common
        --------------------
        
        This library consists of various simple common routines and language 
        constructs that are so useful they ten to be rewritten in every 
        subsequent project we're working on. Each function, decorator or module 
        on its own is too simple to dedicate an entire PyPI package for it. 
        Together however, this tiny library represents a Swiss army knife for 
        everyday needs (YMMV).
        
        The latest version can be installed via `PyPI 
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/langacore.kit.common/>`_::
        
          $ pip install langacore.kit.common
          
        or::
        
          $ easy_install langacore.kit.common
        
        The `source code repository <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy>`_ and 
        `issue tracker <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy/issues>`_ are 
        maintained on `GitHub <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy>`_.
        
        **Note:**  Since 0.2.0 ``langacore.kit.common`` does require **Python 
        2.7** because one of the virtues in the creation of this library is to 
        make the code beautiful.
