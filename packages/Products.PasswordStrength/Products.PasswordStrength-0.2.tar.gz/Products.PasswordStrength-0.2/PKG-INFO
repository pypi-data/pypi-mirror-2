Description: PasswordStrength
        
        This Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) plugin validates
        passwords against regular expression rules. These rules can
        ensure a passwords strength such as minimum lenth and required
        characthers.
        This plugin contains a patch to plone to use PAS validation.
        
        Requires:
        
        - PluggableAuthService and its dependencies
        
        - (optional) PlonePAS and its dependencies
        
        - Plone 3.x
        
        
        Installation
        
        Place the Product directory 'PasswordStength' in your 'Products/'
        directory. Restart Zope.
        
        In your PAS 'acl_users', select 'PasswordStrength' from the add
        list.  Give it an id and title, and push the add button.
        
        Enable the 'Validation' plugin interfaces in the after-add screen.
        
        Click on the properties tab and edit the validation rules
        
        To use with plone, you need to install PasswordStrength using quickinstaller
        
        That's it! Test it out.
        
        
        Implementation
        
        A PAS plugin for Validation checks the password against each regular
        expression listed in the properties. Any rules that fail result in
        the associated error messages being returned.
        
        Plone doesn't use PAS to validate passwords so included is a patch to
        Products.CMFPlone.RegistrationTool.RegistrationTool.testPasswordValidity
        which makes plone use PAS validation plugins.
