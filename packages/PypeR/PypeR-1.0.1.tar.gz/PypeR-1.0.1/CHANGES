Changes between version PypeR-1.0 to PypeR-1.01:

	1. Redict stderr to stdout for R. This can be disabled by setting
		"return_err=False" when initialize a R instance, e.g., 
		"r = R(return_err=False)"

	2. In order that user settings can be used by R, R is launched with
		arguments "--quiet --no-save --no-restore" instead of "--vanilla",
		which equal to "--no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-init-file
		--no-environ".

	3. A version variable is added for the module: __version__ = 1.01

	4. Suppressed the popup terminal window on Windows.

	5. Added the user-specific library PATH in IDLE on Windows.
