Change History
**************

1.4.0 (2010-04-06)
==================

 - Changed the download policy to hash the downloaded filenames by default.
   You can revert back to the original behavior by setting a ``hash-name =
   false`` parameter in the section using the recipe. This closes
   http://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/issues#issue/1
   [dokai]

1.3.0 (2009-09-20)
==================

 - Removed support for the deprecated ``download-directory``
   option. [dokai]

 - Refactored the download logic to use the `Download API`_ in
   zc.buildout. We now require zc.buildout >= 1.4.0. [dokai]

.. _`Download API`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout#using-the-download-utility


1.2.2 (2009-08-17)
==================

 - Merged the current trunk (revision 79982) from the Plone Collective
   Subversion repository. The collective repository is now abandoned and the
   Github repository is the canonical one. [dokai]

 - Open files in binary mode when calculating MD5 checksums. This fixes a
   bug with checksums on the Windows platform. Bug report and patch thanks to
   Alexander Ivanov. [dokai]

1.2.1 (2008-04-13)
==================

 - Rename the buildout ``download-directory`` option to ``download-cache``
   (which is the name used by buildout) [thefunny]

 - Added BBB support for the ``download-directory`` option. It will
   emit a deprecation warning and set the ``download-cache`` option
   accordingly. [dokai]

1.2.0 (2008-01-19)
==================

 - Added the `download-only` option to allow downloading arbitrary
   files. [dokai]

1.1.0 (2007-10-14)
==================

 - Refactored the install method so recipe subclasses can override the base
   directory. For more info see ``calculate_base`` method on ``Recipe`` class.
   [hexsprite]

 - Recipe is now a new-style Python class so recipe subclasses can use super()
   method to get some default behavior. [hexsprite]

1.0.1 (2007-08-14)
==================

 - For consistency with other similar recipes, the recipe now sets a
   ``location`` option which may be read by other sections to learn
   where the package was extracted. This is an alias for the
   ``destination`` option.

1.0.0
=====

 - First public release.
