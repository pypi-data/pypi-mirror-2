Description: 
        Introduction
        ============
        
        The ``plonetheme.unilluminated`` package uses the *theming & packaging* features
        available in `plone.app.theming`_ to make the `CSS Templates`_ theme `Unilluminated`_ easily
        available in `Plone 4.1`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Currently, only installation via Python package (and buildout) is supported. But an installable zip file is in development. 
        
        Buildout
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Add ``plonetheme.unilluminated`` to your ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` section's *eggs* parameter e.g.::
        
            [instance]
            eggs =
                Plone
                â€¦
                plonetheme.unilluminated
        
        Zip file
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        XXX Coming soon
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Once you have installed the package, you must configure it in Plone.
        
        Add Plone site
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install Plone 4.1 and create a Plone site (if you have not already) with Diazo theming configured.

        Select theme
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Select and enable the theme from the Diazo control panel.

        Help
        ----
        
        Obviously there is more work to be done. If you want to help, pull requests accepted! Some ideas:
        
        * Fix zip file (currently getting a traceback from lxml, even with zip files from w/p.a.theming tests)
        * Add a diazo rule to import Plone editing styles
        * Configure styles to use portal_css
        * Add quick installer support
