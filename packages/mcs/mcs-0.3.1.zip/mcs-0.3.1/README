mcs – the monticello synchronizer
=================================

What is mcs?
------------

**mcs** is a small tool to synchronize multiple – file or HTTP
based – `Monticello <http://www.wiresong.ca/monticello/v1/>`_
repositories. Synchronization in this case is nothing more than
copying missing versions from one repository to another.

How to use mcs?
---------------

**mcs** is a runnable python package with an easy syntax: It
currently supports two sub-commands (``copy`` and ``list``).
Examples:

``python -m mcs list http://www.squeaksource.com/AST/`` lists
versions in the online SqueakSource repository

``python -m mcs copy http://www.squeaksource.com/AST/ /tmp/ast_repo``
copies all versions from the online SqueakSource repository to the
local ``ast_repo`` folder, only copying versions that are not
already in the local repository

Run ``python -m mcs help`` for more information and optional
switches.

Requirements
------------

**mcs** uses `httplib2 <http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/>`_ for
HTTP repositories and `pyparsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_ 
to parse version information.
