0.6.0 (2010-09-23)
------------------

- reflect changes in zope packages, use new package externals

- fix broken tests

- Fix className handling in javacsript, it seems that newer version of JQuery
  can't handle $.className.has(ele, ...) use $(ele).hasClass(...) instead.

- Fix: getParentsFromContextToObject, don't return a parent chain if an item 
  is a location proxied NotFound error object. It's possible that such a
  NotFound object will wrap a context which we don't allow in our parent
  chain at all.


0.5.1 (2009-03-10)
------------------

- Fix: use imports from newest packages e.g. zope.site.folder.Folder

- Fix: be smart to NotFound error objects. NotFound errors are not locatable.


0.5.0 (2008-04-16)
------------------

- Fix: adjust ITreeItems adapter. Added additional discriminator which 
  prevents to get missused as /@@/ adapter if configured with base registry

- implemented ITreeItems adapter which is responsible for list all items listed
  in tree

- Initial Release
