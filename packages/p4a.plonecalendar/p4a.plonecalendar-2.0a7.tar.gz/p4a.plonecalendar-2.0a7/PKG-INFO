Description: ===================
         p4a.plonecalendar
        ===================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        p4a.plonecalendar is a project which extends the p4a.calendar framework to
        run natively within a Plone environment.  It contains the extensions that
        require Plone, and the adaptions to Plone. This is mainly support for Plone
        event types and iCalendar import/export.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        Plone 3.x. Tested with 3.2 and 3.3 but may work with other versions.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. Add p4a.plonecalendar as a dependency either to your buildout:
              [buildout]
              eggs = p4a.plonecalendar
        
        2. Include p4a.plonecalendar ZCML:
              [instance]
              zcml = p4a.plonecalendar
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        Importing an iCalendar file via http
        ------------------------------------
        
        Plone4Artists calendar can import an iCalendar file over http into a Plone
        calendar. This is useful for example if another site presents a schedule
        that you also want to present or integrate into your site.
        
        An example url for importing an icalendar file over http is::
        
          http://path/to/calendar/import_from_url?url=http://url/to/icalendarfile.ics
        
        This will open up a connection to the other site, get the icalendar file
        called "icalendarfile.ics" and import it into the folder located at 
        /path/to/calendar/

        1.0rc1 (2007-07-31)
        -------------------
        
        - Many bug fixes resulting from the Boston 2007 P4A sprint
        
        - #40 - Events not displayed in Month View on Windows IE6. Default install would
          not display events in IE 6.  Rob Baker supplied fix.
        
        - #39 - Timezone issue when exporting to iCal. Issue is resolved. It was an old
          version of DateTime.py that caused the trouble. Replacing the file with the new
          version (available at zope.org) solved the problem.
        
        - #38 - Time formatting for internationalization. P4A Calendar now uses the i18n
          library to convert the hour/minute format to the locale based on the language
          of the incoming browser request.  This change removed several methods on the
          Month class that were formally handling this formatting chore.
          However, this new code does not have any tests written against it.
        
        - #36 - Event starting in the past, ending in the future is not listed.
          The submitter of the original bug supplied a patch. The patch was applied to the
          code base and tested. We concluded that the patch solves this issue.
        
        - #35 - KeyError causes month view to crash
        
        - #34 and #37 - Bug deals with a site breakage when the P4A product is removed
          from the file system. This occurs after marker interfaces are set on containerish
          objects. Rocky Burt concluded that this is a core Zope issue and provided a
          workaround is to remove all marker interfaces for P4A when uninstalling the
          product via the QuickInstaller. Reinstall does not affect the marker interface
          settings. The drawback is that if the product is uninstalled all site setting
          dealing with the calendar will be lost. But it was considered worse to have a
          product that breaks a site with its removal from the files system. The long term
          solution will have to come from Zope core.
        
        - #30 - Changing folder back to normal causes error.
        
        - #28 - Events with future month don't show up
