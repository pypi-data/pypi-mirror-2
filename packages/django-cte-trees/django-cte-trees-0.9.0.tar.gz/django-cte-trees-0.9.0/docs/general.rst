General

=============================
Prerequisites
=============================

- Python >= 2.4
- Django >= 1.2
- PostgreSQL >= 8.4
- psycopg2 >= 2.4


Optionally, for migration management:

- South >= 0.7

=============================
Obtaining
=============================

- Author's home page of the project: http://www.petrounias.org/software/django-cte-trees/

- Mercurial repository on BitBucket: http://www.bitbucket.org/petrounias/django-cte-trees/


=============================
Installation
=============================

Include the cte_tree module as an application in your Django project through the INSTALLED_APPS list in your settings::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'cte_tree',
        ...,
    )



=============================
Basic Usage
=============================

Define a Model which inherits from cte_tree.models.CTENode::

    class Category(CTENode):
	
        name = CharField(max_length = 128, null = False)
		
        def __unicode__(self):
            return '%s @ %s' % (self.name, self.depth)
			
The Category Model will now have a *parent* foreign key to *self*, as well as all the tree structure virtual fields (depth, path, ordering) and methods inherited from CTENode, and a custom Manager for performing the custom CTE queries.

The following is an example usage of Category::

    >>> root = Category.objects.create(name = 'root')
    >>> middle = Category.objects.create(name = 'middle', parent = root)
    >>> bottom = Category.objects.create(name = 'bottom', parent = middle)
    >>> print(Category.objects.all())
    [<Category: root @ 1>, <Category: middle @ 2>, <Category: bottom @ 3>]

See the module documentation and examples for a comprehensive guide on using the CTE node and its manager.

=============================
Release Notes
=============================

- Prototype (0.9.0) @ 3 May 2011: Initial public release.


=============================
Future Work
=============================

- Abstract models for sibling ordering semantics (integer total and partial orders, and lexicographic string orders) [high priority, easy task].
- Support for dynamic specification of traveral and ordering [normal priority, hard task].
- Support other databases (which feature CTE in some way) [low priority, normal difficulty task].
