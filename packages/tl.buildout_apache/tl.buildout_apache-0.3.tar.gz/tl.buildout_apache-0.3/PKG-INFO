Description: ==================
        tl.buildout_apache
        ==================
        
        
        This is a collection of `zc.buildout`_ recipes for setting up an `Apache web
        server`_ environment. It provides the following entry points:
        
        :httpd:
            Builds the Apache HTTP server software from source.
        
        :modpython:
            Builds the Apache/Python integration module from source.
        
        :root:
            Configures an Apache server root (an instance in Zope speak).
        
        These recipes appear to be reliable, but the feature set is basically
        determined by the author's immediate needs. Don't hesitate to send questions,
        bug reports, suggestions, or patches to <thomas@thomas-lotze.de>.
        
        
        The build recipe: ``tl.buildout_apache:httpd``
        ==============================================
        
        None of the options described below are required: they either have sensible
        defaults or are computed by the recipe. You may override any of them.
        
        Configuration options:
        
            :url:
                Where to get the source distribution.
        
            :md5sum:
                MD5 checksum of the source distribution.
        
            :extra-options:
                Extra configure options, appended to the ``./configure`` command line.
        
            :extra-vars:
                Extra environment variables for ``./configure``, ``make``, and ``make
                install`` calls.
        
        Exported options:
        
            :httpd-path:
                Absolute file system path to the ``httpd`` executable.
        
            :envvars-path:
                Absolute file system path to the ``envvars`` script.
        
            :apxs-path:
                Absolute file system path to the ``apxs`` executable.
        
            :module-dir:
                Absolute file system path to the shared modules directory.
        
            :htdocs:
                Absolute file system path to the document directory distributed with
                the Apache server, containing the welcome page.
        
            :cgi-bin:
                Absolute file system path to the document cgi-bin distributed with
                the Apache server, containing test and demo scripts.
        
        .. NOTE::
            Building httpd has been tested without any compiler or linker flags set
            (``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` environment variables). It has also been
            observed that httpd may not build with certain linker flags. If the httpd
            recipe fails with a warning from the ``make`` run, try again with the
            above variables unset.
        
        .. CAUTION::
            If you plan to embed Python 2.4 into Apache, e.g. by using `mod_python`_,
            make sure you have version 1.95.8 of the expat library and its development
            files installed on your system when running the build recipe. Otherwise
            Apache will use its own, older version of expat which may later on lead to
            segmentation faults due to two incompatible expat versions being
            used in the same process.
        
            This is a temporary measure of caution since Python 2.5 and above avoid
            the conflict. Therefore, the recipe doesn't step out of its way to make
            sure about the expat version programmatically.
        
        
        The mod_python recipe: ``tl.buildout_apache:modpython``
        =======================================================
        
        None of the options described below are required: they either have sensible
        defaults or are computed by the recipe. You may override any of them.
        
        Configuration options:
        
            :url:
                Where to get the source distribution.
        
            :md5sum:
                MD5 checksum of the source distribution.
        
            :extra-options:
                Extra configure options, appended to the ``./configure`` command line.
        
            :extra-vars:
                Extra environment variables for ``./configure``, ``make``, and ``make
                install`` calls.
        
            ..
        
            :httpd:
                The name of a buildout section for an httpd installation, defaults to
                "httpd". It must export the "apxs-path" option.
        
            :python:
                The name of a buildout section for a Python installation, defaults to
                the Python section used by the "buildout" part. It must export the
                "executable" option.
        
            :virtualenv:
                Whether to create a virtual Python environment from the Python
                installation given. Defaults to "true". The recipe needs to write to
                its Python's site packages, so don't turn this off unless the
                ``python`` option describes a writable (probably virtual) Python
                installation that this part should share.
        
        Exported options:
        
            :modpython:
                Absolute file system path to the ``mod_python.so`` shared module.
        
            :executable:
                The Python executable that should be used for installing eggs.
        
        
        The server root recipe: ``tl.buildout_apache:root``
        ===================================================
        
        An Apache server process configured with this recipe will run the "prefork"
        multi-processing module.
        
        None of the options described below are required: they either have sensible
        defaults or are computed by the recipe. You may override any of them.
        
        The configuration of an Apache root may be split across a number of buildout
        sections in order to allow for semantic grouping, re-use etc. These sections
        are called config parts and are usually just configuration sections without
        the need of a buildout recipe. Config parts work recursively.
        
        Configuration options that apply only to the root part:
        
            :httpd:
                The name of a buildout section for an httpd installation, defaults to
                "httpd". It must export the following options:
        
                - httpd-path
                - envvars-path
                - module-dir
        
                Other options, if present, are used to provide default values for the
                root part's own options:
        
                - htdocs
                - cgi-bin
        
            ..
        
            :ulimit:
                Command to increase the maximum allowed number of file descriptors per
                child process.
        
            :sysconf-dir:
                Absolute file system path to the system configuration directory, e.g.
                ``/etc``. It is used to find MIME configuration files.
        
            :lynx-path:
                Absolute file system path to the ``lynx`` executable.
        
            ..
        
            :user:
                User name to run the server as (if starting it as root).
        
            :group:
                Group name to run the server as (if starting it as root).
        
            :listen:
                Interfaces and ports to listen at, such as 127.0.0.1:80.
        
            ..
        
            :python:
                The name of a buildout section defining a mod_python installation.
                If not given, mod_python is not used. If present, the named section
                must export the following options:
        
                - modpython
                - executable
        
            ..
        
            :virtual-hosts:
                name=address pairs for configuring name-based virtual hosts. The name
                selects a config-part describing the host, the address is an IP
                address with an optional port, e.g. 127.0.0.1:80.
        
        Configuration options that apply to both the root part and virtual hosts:
        
            :servername:
                Server name to announce, e.g. localhost:80. Mandatory for virtual
                hosts.
        
            :serveradmin:
                E-mail address of the server administrator.
        
            :htdocs:
                Absolute file system path to the document root, defaults to the value
                of the httpd part's ``htdocs`` option.
        
            :cgi-bin:
                Absolute file system path to the CGI library directory, defaults to
                the value of the https part's ``cgi-bin`` option.
        
            :log-dir:
                File system path to the log directory to be created, either absolute
                or relative to the server root.
        
            ..
        
            :index:
                See the zc.recipe.egg documentation.
        
        Configuration options that apply to config-parts, including the root and
        virtual host parts:
        
            :modules:
                Names of shared modules to load, e.g. "dir" or "rewrite". Includes
                authz_host by default. To specify the shared object path of a module,
                add an entry of the form "foo=path/to/foo.so". Paths are either
                absolute or considered relative to the httpd installation.
        
            :extra-env:
                Additional variables to be exported to httpd's environment.
                Each line is of the form "``<name>=<value>``", e.g.
                "``PATH=/opt/foo:$PATH``".
        
            :extra-config:
                Arbitrary multi-line server configuration.
        
            ..
        
            :eggs:
                Specifications of eggs to be added to the Python module search path
                available to code run by mod_python.
        
            :find-links:
                See the zc.recipe.egg documentation.
        
            :extra-paths:
                Non-egg paths to be included in the Python module search path.
        
            ..
        
            :config-parts:
                Names of buildout sections with further configuration. The following
                options exported from config parts are recognized:
        
                - config-parts (included recursively)
                - modules
                - extra-env
                - extra-config
