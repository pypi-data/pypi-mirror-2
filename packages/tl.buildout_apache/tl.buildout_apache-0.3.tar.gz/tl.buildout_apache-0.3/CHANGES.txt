Change log for tl.buildout_apache
=================================

0.3 (2011-04-10)
================

- Moved the project to the Mercurial vcs, created a Bitbucket home for it and
  added an ABOUT.txt file listing the new resources.

- No longer support Python 2.4.

- Improved debugging output in the event that the virtual Python could not be
  installed. Output a hint that zc.buildout 1.5 and greater might interact
  badly with virtualenv and cause mod_python to fail compiling if configured
  so as to run python with the -S switch.

- Updated the default download URL for the mod_python source distribution.

- Switched from using gocept.cmmi to zc.recipe.cmmi since the former has been
  deprecated in favour of the latter. We can use a shared httpd build now.

- Patch mod_python to fix build failure according to
  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-249>.


0.2 (2009-03-23)
================

Features:
  - Merged the tl.buildout_mod_python recipe into this project.

    * The root recipe configures mod_python from a
      ``tl.buildout_apache:modpython`` section named by its ``python`` option.
      A modpython part no longer acts as a config part for a root part.
    * The modpython recipe creates its own virtual Python environment by
      default, which the tl.buildout_mod_python recipe didn't do.
    * The root recipe collects ``eggs``, ``find-links`` and ``extra-paths``
      options from its config-parts and configures an appropriate PythonPath.

  - The root recipe's ``modules`` option now accepts values of the form
    ``foo=/path/to/foo.so`` for loading modules known by shared object path.

  - Support name-based virtual hosts via the ``virtual-hosts`` option of the
    root recipe.

  - The httpd recipe now exports the path to the demo cgi scripts as the
    ``cgi-bin`` variable.

  - The ``htdocs`` and ``cgi-bin`` options of the main and each virtual host
    default to the values of the respective httpd recipe's option, if present.

Bug fixes:
  - Moved the responsibility for installing eggs to the root recipe so the
    modpython recipe is confined to compilation.

    * Got rid of the awkward path file.
    * Avoid unnecessary re-compilations of the Apache module whenever the set
      of specified eggs and paths changed.

  - Collect config-parts depth-first.

  - Improved test coverage.


0.1.5 (2008-10-06)
==================

Organization:
  - updated to Apache 2.2.9
  - started using the apache.org archive, hoping that this serves as a stable
    URL
  - moved project in Subversion to
    <https://svn.thomas-lotze.de/repos/public/tl.buildout_apache/>


0.1.4 (2008-02-03)
==================

Features:
  - added log-dir option to the root recipe to allow for logging to a place
    that isn't destroyed when reinstalling the server root part

Bug fixes:
  - removed the builtin-modules option from the httpd recipe documentation
  - renamed the conf-dir option to sysconf-dir for more consistency

Organization:
  - updated to Apache 2.2.8
  - moved project in Subversion to
    <https://svn.thomas-lotze.de/repos/public/buildout_apache/>


0.1.3 (2007-06-16)
==================

Features:
  - added the extra-env option to config parts for exporting additional
    variables to httpd's environment

Bug fixes:
  - in httpd.conf, load each module only once, retain their order

  - don't require the httpd buildout section to export options typical of the
    gocept.cmmi recipe

Organization:
  - set up a zc.buildout environment for a development installation

  - added some tests


0.1.2 (2007-03-20)
==================

Bug fixes:
  - use bz2 download URL (the MD5 sum had already been that of the bz2)


0.1.1 (2007-02-25)
==================

Bug fixes:
  - remove the ctl script when uninstalling an Apache root part


0.1 (2007-02-22)
