1.1.1:
* Fixed format string warnings on Mac OS X
* Included Gnulib for Mac OS X support
* Updated docs to reflect OS X support

1.1.0:
* Fixed format warning on 32-bit systems
* Fixed Ubuntu format string warnings (switched fprintf to fputs)
* Fixed bug that caused segmentation fault when accessing
  tracknames_continuous before data when Genome was not used as a
  context manager.
* Created a uniform interface for loading Genomedata archives, whether they
  are a directory or a single file (untested). This includes calling improving
  the handling of non-context-manager Genome objects by requiring a call
  to Genome.close() when finished.
* Added an option to genomedata-load-seq and genomedata-load
  to specify the Genomedata archive implementation (directory/file). 
  Default is directory if number of sequences is at least 100.
* Added support for replacing data in Genomedata tracks.
* General documentation improvements

1.0.1:
* Fixed OSX bug that caused installer to crash on sys.stdin.flush
* Clarified write-once behavior in documentation
* Added textinput to installation requirements

1.0.0:
* added test module with basic unit tests
* improved documentation, examples
* added verbose flags
* compiled default types in __init__.py
* added _load_data.py wrapper for genomedata_load_data.c

0.1.6:

* extend documentation, including examples
* extended API with: chromosome[start:end], chromosome.seq[start:end],
  and chromosome.supercontigs[start:end]
* added reasonable repr and str return values for Genome, Chromosome, 
  and Supercontig

0.1.5:

* add documentation
* change ".h5" suffix to ".genomedata"

0.1.4:

* strip out seq_counts, seq_total_counts, etc. from metadata (big
  speed increase for save-metadata)

0.1.3:

* add genomedata-report
* export genomedata-load-seq script
* _load_data now supports BED, bedGraph input
* added slice support to genomedata.Chromosome
* added genomedata.Supercontig.project()
* Genome.__iter__() now iterates only through files ending in .h5
* add Genome.sums, Genomes.sums_squares, Genome.num_datapoints
* fix bug where use of context manager doesn't actually result in closing all open files
* fix bug in save metadata that causes some regions with data to be ignored
