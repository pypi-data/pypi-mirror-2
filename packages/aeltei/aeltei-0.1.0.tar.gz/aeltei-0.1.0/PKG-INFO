Description: 
        ======
        aeltei
        ======
        
        aeltei is a virtual multi instrument environment using soundfonts. It allows
        one to use a keyboard to enter and play musical notes in a curses interface,
        i.e. on the command line. Current limitations include only support for one
        channel, no pitch bending, and no saving recordings as MIDI files.
        
        aeltei only works on Python 2.x where x >= 5. Python 3 support would require
        Python 3 support in the modules used by this program.
