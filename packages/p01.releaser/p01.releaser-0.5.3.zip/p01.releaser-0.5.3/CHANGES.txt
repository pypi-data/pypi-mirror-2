CHANGES
=======

0.5.3 (unreleased)
------------------

- bugfix broken back to dev step

0.5.2 (2011-08-27)
------------------

- improve version/date parsing. Something like this window.open('') was
  parsed as version headline

- skip inline editing, just open the CHANGES.txt file and abort. I will
  probably bring back the CHANGES.txt fiel editing back if I'll find a way to
  open the file in an editor an block the subprocess till the editor will get
  closed. This is not so simple because opening a file in an already open
  editor will not block a subprocess.call

0.5.1 (2011-08-25)
------------------

- added missing register argument in setup.py call. Seems that the pypi index
  needs this option or a package will not show up in th index

0.5.0 (2011-08-25)
------------------

- initial release done with p01.releaser
