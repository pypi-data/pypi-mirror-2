collective.xdv Installation
---------------------------

To install collective.xdv into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install collective.xdv``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* Create a file called ``collective.xdv-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="collective.xdv" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Specify required versions by adding a line to the list of extends, e.g.:

	[buildout]
	...
	extends = 
		versions.cfg
		http://good-py.appspot.com/release/collective.xdv/1.0
			
* Add ``collective.xdv`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.xdv
             
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
The ZCML slug is added automaticly via z3c.autoinclude so there is no need to specify it at the zcml part of your instance.
