"""Spike sum histogram of spike train data.

This class works with 
:class:`~neuronpy.graphics.spikeparams.SpikeParams` and
:class:`~neuronpy.graphics.spikeplot.SpikePlot` to show the cumulative
count of spikes from one cell from raster plots containing rows of 
spike trains.

For detailed examples, see

EXAMPLES:

This example generates some random "spikes" and displays them.

::

    import numpy
    from neuronpy.graphics import spikeplot

    spikes = []
    num_cells = 10
    num_spikes_per_cell = 20
    frequency = 20

    # Make the spike data. Use a simple Poisson-like spike generator 
    # (just for illustrative purposes here. Better spike generators should 
    # be used in simulations).
    for i in range(num_cells):
        isi=numpy.random.poisson(frequency, num_spikes_per_cell)
        spikes.append(numpy.cumsum(isi))
        
    # spikes is now a list of lists where each cell has a list of spike
    # times. Now, let's plot these spikes with the default parameters.
    sp = spikeplot.SpikePlot(sum_ratio=0.3, savefig=True)
    sp.plot_spikes(spikes)
