Changelog
=========

0.3.2
-----

* This release is only to compensate for my stupidity when
  I first developed this package and then removed it from pypi. 
  Yes, I know now how dumb this was.
  
* This is an attempt to fix prior mistakes. If you're having
  picking during upgrades and such because this package is no
  longer available or you can't really install it, this is your
  answer. Download this version and run the uninstall profile
  in zmi -> portal_setup -> import -> select `uwosh.ATImageEditor uninstall`.
  and then you should be able to remove uwosh.ATImageEditor once and for all.
