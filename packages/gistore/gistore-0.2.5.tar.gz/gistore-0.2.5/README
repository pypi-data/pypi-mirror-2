INSTALLATION:

Thank you for trying gistore.  To install, run:

	python setup.py install

The build process can be also be run separately:

	python setup.py build

The default prefix is generally /usr, so files would be put in /usr/bin,
/usr/share/man/, etc.  An alternate prefix can be specified using the
--prefix=<prefix> option.  For example:

	python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

The default prefix depends on how you (or your distribution) installed and
configured Python. Suggested reading is "How installation works" from the
Python docs, which includes commands to determine your default prefix:
http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#how-installation-works

	python setup.py install --help

More information about using setup.py and how gistore is installed
is available from the Python guide, Installing Python Modules for System
Administrators, located at http://docs.python.org/install/index.html

REQUIREMENTS:

*nix is support, but Windows not.

You need Python, 2.5 or later is recommended. Previous versions of 
Python have not been tested. For Python, see http://www.python.org.

Gistore is a backup system with a DVCS as backend, and git is highly
recommended. Orignally or currently only git is supportted. So, you
must have git installed. For git installation, see http://git-scm.com/.

Gistore can *store* files and directories from any place, without copying
or sync files to the gistore DVCS working tree. All the backup files
and directories are mounted to the gistore DVCS working tree on the fly.
Currently mount only works on *nix, so Windows is not supported.

Some operations may need root privilege, such as mount, or backup system
files in /etc. If you not backup system files but only your personal data
run as a normal user maybe ok, with the help of bindfs or sudo. If the 
system has installed bindfs and fuse-utils, mount may success without root
permission. If not, sudo is used.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you have everything installed properly, and it still doesn't work,
see the enclosed FAQ.html, the web page at http://open.ossxp.com.
