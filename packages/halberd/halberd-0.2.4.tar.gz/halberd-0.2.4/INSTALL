Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

You need Python version 2.6 or above with the threading module
enabled.  If you want to scan using the HTTPS protocol, you will also
need a Python interpreter configured with support for SSL sockets.

Platforms
---------

Halberd should work in every machine satisfying the prerequisites
mentioned above.  The program has been successfully built and tested
on GNU/Linux, Windows 2000 and Mac OS X.

Steps
-----

Installing Halberd is a very simple task.  It suffices to write
(perhaps as root):

    python setup.py install

It is recommended that you read the output of:

    python setup.py install --help

in case you want to fine tune the installation process.
