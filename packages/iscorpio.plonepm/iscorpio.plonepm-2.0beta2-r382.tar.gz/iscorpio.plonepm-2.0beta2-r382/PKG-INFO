        ================
        
        Plone Project Management is a light weight project management software
        closely follow the eXtreame Programming's concept.  It helps project
        manager to break down a complex project to a set of stories and create
        a set of tasks for each story.  Then project manager can assign each
        task to team members.
        
        Plone Project Managementprovides progress bars for each task, each
        story and the whole project.  So project managers can have a clear and
        direct view of how is this project going.
        
        Meanwhile, Plone Project Management also provides a set of document
        types (memos, issues, and proposals) to keep tracking the whole
        project's progress.
        
        Leverage on Plone Workflow
        
        leverage on plone workflow to let everybody can add memo, issue,
        and/or proposal to each task, story, and project.
        
        we need "Add plone content" + plone_workflow setting, and revise the
        folder_workflow to disable list content of folder.
        
        Leverage on Smart Folder
        
        leverage on smart folder to provide a full list of memos, issues, and
        proposals for the whole project.
        
        Leverage on portal_catalog
        
        For this version, you have to manually create index and metadata for
        field getXpoint_tracking_status
        
        Thinking about programmly add the following metadata to portal_catalog.
        getXpoint_tracking_status
        getTask_estimated_hours
        getTask_used_hours
        getTask_owners
        getTask_progress_percent
        getTask_completion_date
        we may not need the add those fields into index, except
        getXpoint_tracking_status.
        
        ????? looks like we have to add all of them into the index.
