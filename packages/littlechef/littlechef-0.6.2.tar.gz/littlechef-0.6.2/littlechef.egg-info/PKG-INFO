Description: Cook with Chef without Chef Server
        -------------------------------------
        With LittleChef you will get all you need to start cooking with Chef_.
        
        It works as follows: Whenever you apply a recipe to a node, all needed
        cookbooks and its dependencies are gzipped and uploaded to that node. A
        node.json file gets created on the fly and uploaded, and Chef Solo gets
        executed at the remote node, using node.json as the node configuration and the
        pre-installed solo.rb for Chef Solo configuration. Cookbooks, data bags and roles
        are configured to be found at (/var/chef-solo/).
        
        The result is that you can play as often with your recipes and nodes as you
        want, without having to worry about a central Chef repository, Chef server nor
        anything else. You can make small changes to your cookbooks and test them again
        and again without having to commit the changes. LittleChef brings sanity
        to cookbook development.
