Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Blackbird is an open source javascript logging facility written by G Scott
        Olson and released under the MIT License.
        
        Please read Scott's website for instructions on how to use the logging
        functionality.

        This Plone compatibility egg provides the following functionality:
        
        *   Registers the JS file Blackbird.js in portal_javascripts. This file will only
        be loaded if your portal_javascripts tool is in debug mode.
        
        *   Additionally I've added another file Blackbird_disabled.js that is loaded when
        portal_javascripts is *not* in debug mode and which overrides Blackbird's 'log'
        namespace with empty functions. This allows you to safely leave log statements
        in your javascript even though Blackbird.js is not being loaded.
        
        *   Registers Blackbird.css to style the logging prompt.
        
        *   Registers a viewlet for IBelowContent that enables you to toggle the logging prompt's visibility and position.
