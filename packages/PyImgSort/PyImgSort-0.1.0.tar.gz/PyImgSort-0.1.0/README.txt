PyImgSort
===========

PyImgSort is a simple utility that automatically organizes a directory of image files into subdirectories by their aspect ratio.  Its intended use is the sorting of large 'wallpaper' directories.::

    $ python pyimgsort */absolute/path/to/directory*
    
    **or**
    
    $ python pyimgsort
    ``>>> Enter a directory you'd like to sort:`` *absolute/path/to/directory*



Requirements:
=========

* Python 2.6 or later

* The Python Imaging Library >= 1.1.6 (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

Notes
-------------

I'm very new to Python.

This is an ugly, barely-functional script.  It's not really meant for general consumption, but you're more than welcome to use it if you think you can get some use out of it.  For that matter, you're also more than welcome to modify it, copy it, distribute it (free of charge), etc. to your heart's content.
