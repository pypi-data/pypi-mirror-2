        PyImgSort
        ===========
        
        PyImgSort is a simple utility that automatically organizes a directory of image files into subdirectories by their aspect ratio.  Its intended use is the sorting of large 'wallpaper' directories.::
        
            $ pyimgsort */optional/absolutely/path/to/directory*
            
            **or**
            
            $ python /path/to/pyimgsort.py */optional/absolute/path/to/directory*
            
            **or**
            
            $ python /path/to/pyimgsort.py
            ``>>> Enter a directory you'd like to sort:`` *absolute/path/to/directory*
            
            **In Windows:**
            
            Open a command prompt and type:
            
            C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\pyimgsort.py
            
            (Or just double-click on the script)
        
        
        
        Requirements:
        =============
        
        * Python 2.6 or later
        
        * The Python Imaging Library >= 1.1.6 (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
        
        
        Installation:
        =============
        
        * In *nix:  Unpack the tarball, open a terminal, navigate to the directory in which you unpacked the tarball, and type (as admin, i.e., "su" or "sudo") ``python setup.py install``
        
        * In Windows, just run the .exe as normal.  The script will be installed to C:\*Pythondir*\Lib\site-packages
        
        Notes
        -------------
        
        I'm very new to Python.
        
        This is an ugly, barely-functional script.  It's not really meant for general consumption, but you're more than welcome to use it if you think you can get some use out of it.  For that matter, you're also more than welcome to modify it, copy it, distribute it (free of charge), etc. to your heart's content.
