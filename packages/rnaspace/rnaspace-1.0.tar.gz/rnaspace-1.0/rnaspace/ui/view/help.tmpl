    RNAspace is a web platform to support non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA)
    identification on genomic sequences. The platform allows running in 
    an integrated environment a variety of
    ncRNA gene finders, to explore  results with
    dedicated tools for comparison, visualization and edition of putative
    ncRNAs and to export them in various formats (FASTA, GFF, RNAML).<br />
    The environment is developed as a collaboration between 
    <a href="http://www.rnaspace.org/partners">several French
    bioinformatics platforms and laboratories</a>. 
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    It is an Open Source software available through:<br />

  <div class="help_title">
    Navigation on www.rnaspace.org 
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    All pages have the same header, which features four tabs: 

    <ul>
      <li> Home </li>
      <li> Load data </li> 
      <li> Predict </li> 
      <li> Explore </li>  
    </ul>

    The Home tab leads to <a href="http://www.rnaspace.org">RNAspace
    home page</a>. The three other tabs are used to perform analyses of genomic
    sequences. 
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    The first step is to access the Load page, using the Load
    data tab, and to enter the query sequences. This starts a new 
    <b>project</b>.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    When this is done, the Predict page is displayed. There, in the second step,
    you have to choose a set of annotation tools, 
    and start the computation. This start the first <b>run</b> of the current 
    project: A run is the execution of a selection of gene finders on your data.
    A 6-letter identifier (ID) is associated to the project, and the run is 
    numbered <tt>r01</tt>.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    Once results are obtained, the Export page is automatically displayed, 
    allowing you to examine predicted putative RNAs, modify them,
    export them. At this third step, you can also return to the
    Predict page using the Predict tab to select additional program
    tools on the same data, or same programs with modified parameter values.
    This starts a new run in the current project.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    If you want to analyse new data, you have to proceed to the Load
    page using the Load data tab. By doing this, you start a new project, 
    and the previously uploaded data and associated results  are lost. 
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    All pages feature a <b>help button</b> in the top right corner of the
    page. It links to this context-sensitive Help page, which is opened in a 
    new tab (or a new window, depending on your browser setting).
    This tab is opened just once during the session.

    Load data page: load genomic sequences
  </div>
  
  <div class="paragraph">
    In this page, you have to load the genomic sequences you want to
    analyse and give some information on each sequence.
  </div>
  
  <div class="paragraph">
    <b>Enter a query sequence.</b> 
    You can either paste the sequence in the text area or upload it 
    from a local file. In both cases, the FASTA format is required. 
    FASTA format consists of a comment line  (a line beginning with '>') 
    followed by the genomic sequence. The sequence should contain only A, U, 
    T, G, C, N letters in either upper or lower case.
    <pre>
      > sequence 1 
      ACGUGCUCGUACGUGCACGUUGCUCCG
      CGUUUGUAGCUGUUGAGUGAGCCGAUG
    </pre>
    Note that a multiFASTA file, that is a concatenation of sequences
    in FASTA format, is accepted when sequences share the same values
    for required information (see below). The number of sequences per
    multiFASTA is limited to ${NB_SEQUENCE_LIMITATION} sequences.<br />
   
    There is a global size limitation on loaded sequences: 
    ${SEQUENCE_SIZE_LIMITATION} nucleotides.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <b>Enter the sequence name.</b> By default, a name of the
    form <tt>seq_000001</tt> is given. The name must be made up of upper 
    and lower case letters, figures and '_', '.', '-' characters. 
    The length of the name must be between 1 and 40 characters.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph"> 
    <b>Specify the domain of the sequence.</b>
    There are three possible domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryote. 
    This information will be useful to provide suitable prediction tools 
    in the Predict step. 
  </div>

  <div  class="paragraph">
    Optionally, you can also specify:
   
    <ul>
      <li> the <b>species</b>, such as <tt>Escherichia_coli</tt>,</li>
      <li> the <b>strain</b>, such as <tt>K12</tt>,</li>
      <li> the <b>replicon</b>, such as <tt>chromosome</tt> or 
	<tt>plasmid1</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>
   
    The three values may be composed of figures 0-9, letters in either upper 
    or lower case, '_', '.' and '-'. Each value must have a length between 1 
    and 20 characters. If not provided, theses values are set to 
    <tt>'unknown'</tt>.		    
  </div>

  <div  class="paragraph">
    Click on the <b>upload button</b> to upload the sequence. The
    format of the sequence and all given values are then checked. 
    If the control is successful, the sequence is added to your data and 
    displayed in a summary table.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    You can enter as many sequences as you want by repeating this process, 
    provided that you do not exceed the total limitation 
    of ${SEQUENCE_SIZE_LIMITATION} nucleotides.
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph"> 
    Once all sequences are loaded, you should enter your <span id="email">Email
    address</span> (multiple addresses splited by a coma), in order to be 
    alerted when computation will be finished. You can then access the Predict 
    page by clicking on the <b>submit button</b>, at the bottom of the page.

  <div  class="paragraph">
    <b>Select one or several tools</b> by ticking the corresponding check box.
    For each tool, a short description  can be accessed by clicking on the

    section. 
  </div>

  <div class="paragraph"> 
    <b>Optionally modify parameters value.</b>
    Each gene finder is proposed with default parameter values. 
    There are two kinds of parameters: visible ones, displayed on the 
    Predict page (in drop-down lists), and advanced ones accessible by 
    clicking on the <b>parameters button</b> to the right on the gene finder 
    name. All gene finders do not have visible and/or advanced parameters.
    Be careful: parameters are modified for all active Predict pages
    of the current session.

          <li><b>miRBase 13.0</b> is database of published miRNA sequences and

    <div class="paragraph">
      The rationale of comparative analysis is that ncRNAs are
      under a positive selection pressure and therefore should be better
      conserved than other sequences (just like coding sequences). This
      gives a way to detect these conserved elements by searching for
      similar sequences across species. 
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      In the <b>first step</b>, you have to select at least one up to
      four species to be compared with. Each species is related to
      one or several genomes or strains.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      In the <b>second step</b>, a prediction method has to be
      chosen. There first a similarity search is done by either
      <b>BLAST</b> or <b>YASS</b> (see description above) to collect
      all conserved sequences with the query sequence. Only intergenic
      regions are processed. Pairwise alignments are automatically
      combined into clusters of conserved regions with CG-seq [<a
      href="http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/CGseq" target="_blank">more information on
      CG-seq</a>]. Then these conserved sequences are investigated by
      inspection of evolutionary patterns to identify significantly
      conserved secondary structures. RNAz and Carnac are available

      RNAspace allows you to launch of variety of genes finders on your data
      in a single run. Of course, the usage of several tools may lead to
      redundant predictions. The goal of the <b>combine results</b>
      option is to clean up the list of results. When this option is checked, 
      strongly overlapping predictions having the same family name and 
      occurring on the same strand are merged into a single prediction. The new

          assign each selected putative RNAs to one of these two families.
          The names must be made up of upper and lower case letters, 
	  figures and '_' '.' '-' characters. Name length must be between 
	  1 and 20 characters.
        </li> 
        <li> <b>add a new prediction:</b> add a new putative RNA to the list

	  the  RNA:
          ID, family name, genomic sequence name, start position, end position,
	  strand and  optionnaly a secondary structure. 
	  The genomic sequence has to be chosen in the list 
          of previously loaded sequences. See the  section
