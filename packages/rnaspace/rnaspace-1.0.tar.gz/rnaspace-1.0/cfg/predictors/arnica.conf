text: "<div class="help_soft_title">Approach</div>
       caRNAc combines three features: energy minimization,
       phylogenetic comparison and sequence conservation.  It 
       relies on a Sankoff-like folding algorithm that simultaneously infers
       a potential consensus structure and align the sequences. As
       a consequence, the method does not require
       any prior multiple sequence alignment, and appears to be robust
       to noisy datasets.

      <div class="help_soft_title">Parameters</div>
       
      <b>Take GC percent into account:</b>
      When this option is selected, caRNAc uses variable energy
      thresholds for helices selection according to the average GC percent 
      of the involved sequence.
