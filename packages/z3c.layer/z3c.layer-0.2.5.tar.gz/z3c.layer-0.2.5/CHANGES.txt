0.2.5 (2010-04-19)
------------------

- Marked package as retired and inactive.


0.2.4 (2010-04-18)
------------------

- **Security issue:** The traversers defined for
  ``IPageletBrowserLayer`` and ``IMinimalBrowserLayer`` was trusted adapters, so the security
  proxy got removed from each traversed object. Thus all sub-objects
  were publically accessable, too.

  Making this change might BREAK your application!
  That means if security is not well declared.

- Bugfix: use IContentTemplate instead of IPageTemplate which avoids to get the
  layout template if no IPageTemplate is registered


0.2.3 (2007-11-07)
------------------

- Forward-Bug: Due to a bug in mechanize, the testbrowser throws
  ``httperror_seek_wrapper`` instead of ``HTTPError`` errors. Thanks to RE
  normalizers, the code will now work whether the bug is fixed or not in
  mechanize.


0.2.2 (2007-10-31)
------------------

- Fixed package meta-data.

- Bug: Fixed test failures due to depency updates.

- Restructure: Fixed deprecation warning for ``ZopeSecurityPolicy``.


0.2.1 (2007-??-??)
------------------
