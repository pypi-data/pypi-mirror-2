Description: Simple Sunlight
        ===============
        
        Sometimes, all you need is the data. This is the simplest possible wrapper I could make. It returns decoded JSON, with some fat trimmed. It should stay out of your way.
        
        Usage:
        
            >>> from sunlight import Sunlight
            >>> sunlight = Sunlight(API_KEY)
            >>> pelosi = sunlight.legislators.get(lastname='pelosi')
            >>> print pelosi['firstname']
            Nancy
        
        This should work with any method on Sunlight' Congress API defined here: http://services.sunlightlabs.com/docs/Sunlight_Congress_API/
        
        See test.py for more details and examples.
