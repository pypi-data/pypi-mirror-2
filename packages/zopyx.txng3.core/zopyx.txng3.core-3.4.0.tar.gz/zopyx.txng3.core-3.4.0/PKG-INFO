Description: TextIndexNG3 core implementation
        ================================
        
        
        Changes
        -------
        
        3.4.0 (2010/05/20)
        ------------------
        
        - Made the ranking method to be looked up via a utiltiy. This way different
        ranking methods can be used easily.
        
        - Provide better backward compatibility in the 'textindexng' package by
        injecting modules from zopyx.txng3.core into sys.modules.
        
        - Added query argument ``search_all_fields`` to search in all fields when using
        dedicated storage.
        
        - Applying splitter not only to indexed content but also to query.
        
        3.3.4 (2009/12/08)
        ------------------
        
        - workaround for a race condition in storage.py (likely caused by some ZCatalog
        inconsistency and some too optimistic assumptions).
        
        3.3.3 (2009/05/02)
        ------------------
        
        - removed IObjectWrapper and related code that tried to unwrap wrapped content
        
        3.3.2 (2009/03/17)
        ------------------
        
        - added 'textindexng' alias module for backward compatibility
        
        3.3.1 (2009/03/15)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed packaging issue
        
        3.3.0 (2009/03/15)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed Zope trunk compatibility
        
        - Fixed deprecation warnings (spamsch)
        
        - Fixed ting.TingIndex:apply to always return a lazy result (spamsch)
        
        3.2.2
        -----
        
        - Added grokindex.py to ease to use of TXNG in grok.  In future there specific
        implementation details could be included, hidden from the grok user.
        [spamsch]
        
        - Changed python2.4 to python to in runall.sh to make it work with virtualenv
        environments [spamsch]
        
        - Fixed setup.py to never make zip file [spamsch]
        
        - Added dependencies needed for installation in pure zope3 environment.
        [spamsch]
        
        - Fixed TingIndex to play nicely with zope 3 conventions.  It needs to derive
        from TextIndex to also work with hurry.query [spamsch]
        
        - Added simple tests for TingIndex [spamsch]
