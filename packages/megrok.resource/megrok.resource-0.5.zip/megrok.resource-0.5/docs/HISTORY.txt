Changelog
=========

0.5 (2010-07-24)
----------------

* Removed specific ILibrary interface and now use the one from hurry.resource
  so the ILibraryUrl adapter found is the same for megrok.resource.Library and
  hurry.resource.Library. You need hurry.zoperesource 0.5 to have hashed
  resource for hurry.resource.Library instances.

0.4.1 (2010-02-19)
------------------

* Fixed the case where a ResourceLibrary is included using the
  "include" directive, in the same package. It was triggering an error
  because a non-grokked ResourceLibrary does not provide
  `IInclusion`. The directive now checks the subclass of the value to
  determine if the given inclusion is a valid `IInclusion` or a
  ResourceLibrary sub-class.

0.4 (2010-02-18)
----------------

* Cleaned the dependencies : everything is declared as it
  should. `zope.site` is now a main and not test dependency.

* Renamed module "traversal" to "url", to describe accurately what the
  module is about : url computation.

* "mode" from `hurry.resource` is now exposed by the package.

0.3 (2009-12-23)
----------------

* The IResourcesIncluder interface is now automatically implemented
  by the class while using the `include` directive. This makes the
  whole system a lot more natural.

* The interfaces have been moved to a dedicated module. If you used
  to import from `components`, please, correct your code.

0.2 (2009-12-22)
----------------

* Added a ResourceLibrary component that is a mix between a Library
  and a GroupInclusion. It allows to declare both the Library and the
  Resources in a single class but impacts the re-usability.

* Library now directly inherits from grokcore.view.DirectoryResource,
  to inherit the `get` method behavior. This inheritance was avoided
  to prevent grokkers clash (grokcore.view.DirectoryResource grokker
  doesn't have a fallback for the `name` directive.). Our grokker has
  now the priority and explicitly set the `name` directive value.

0.1 (2009-12-21)
----------------

* Initial release
