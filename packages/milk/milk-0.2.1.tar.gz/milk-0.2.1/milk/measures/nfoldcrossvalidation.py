    for train,test in foldgenerator(labels, nfolds=None, origins=None, is_ordered=False)
        ...

    This generator breaks up the data into `n` folds (default 10).

    If `origins` is given, then all elements that share the same origin will
    either be in testing or in training (never in both).  This is useful when
    you have several replicates that shouldn't be mixed together between
    training&testing but that can be otherwise be treated as independent for
    learning.

    Parameters
    ----------
      labels : the labels
      nfolds : nr of folds (default 10)
      origins : if present, must be an array of indices of the same size as labels.
      is_ordered : whether input is in canonical format: i.e., labels/origins
                   are 0..N-1/0..K-1, in order. If True, this can be faster
    Returns
    -------
      iterator over `train, test`, two boolean arrays
    Bugs
    ----
    Algorithm is very naive w.r.t. unbalanced origins.

    This is  slower than it could be if `origins is None`.
