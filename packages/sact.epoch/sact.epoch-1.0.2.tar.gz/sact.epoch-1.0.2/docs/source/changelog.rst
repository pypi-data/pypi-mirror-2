0.6.0 (2010-10-29)
------------------

Fix
~~~

- Make tests about time more stable. [Jonathan Ballet]

  This test was asserting that two consecutives calls of the `ts`
  property return different result, the first call being lower than the
  second call.  But the value returned by `ts` is a floating point
  number expressed in seconds, and it seems that, sometimes, Python's so
  fast that the assertion fails. Using the `test` command with `--repeat
  1000`, it seems that I have 2% runs which are failing with this test
  on my computer.  The fix should be sufficient, since each doctest
  lines are reinterpreted by Doctest, and I guess it should have a
  sufficient cost so that it now passes at 100%.
