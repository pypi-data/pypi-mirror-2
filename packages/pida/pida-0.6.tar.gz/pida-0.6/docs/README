Please note here typo or documentation format rules that should be consistent
throughout the whole document.

- PIDA should always be written PIDA for now. A find and replace will change
   this if necessary.

- The attitude of the writer (using first person, using 'you' or 'the user' to
   speak about the reader...) should be consistent throughout the whole
   document. It is not decided what this attitude shall be yet.

- Anchors should be explicit and composed using the hierarchy of the document
   ie: services_project_manager for Project Manager title in Services.
