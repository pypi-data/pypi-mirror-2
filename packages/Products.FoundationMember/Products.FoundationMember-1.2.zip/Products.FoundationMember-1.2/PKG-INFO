Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Written for the Plone Foundation, to allow people to sign up as members, and be
        approved by a membership committee.
        
        Note: to use this, you must have the permissions defined in config.py
        assigned to people in your site. On plone.org, we also have Foundation
        Members only be addable to a single folder, to better manage the
        process.
