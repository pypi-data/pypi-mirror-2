Description: Pacha was designed from the ground up to be a simple way to backup and
        manage software configuration files from single or multiple server
        instances across the network.
        
        Pacha's approach is to easily deploy an instance and capture any changes
        via a version control, giving the System Administrator the ability
        to rollback and safe guard valid, working configurations and rebuild a
        host from those same configurations.
