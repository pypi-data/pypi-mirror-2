OAuth-Client -- This is a base simple oauth client library.
=========================================================================================
This project is based on http://github.com/leah/python-oauth,
but only the client is used.

Done
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Split the source file into several modules
> Edited the OAuthClient class to do more easy to use in client
> applications only.

Use examples:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> To extending the OAuthClient, git@github.com:carlitux/twython.git could be used 
> as an example.
> To do a client app using this, there is an example here
> http://github.com/carlitux/ITwittBook this app is implemented
> by me for learning purpose.
