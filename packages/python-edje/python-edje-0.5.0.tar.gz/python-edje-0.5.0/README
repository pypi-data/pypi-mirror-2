BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

This package uses setuptools, so execute:

Build::

        python setup.py build

Install::

        python setup.py install

You can choose where to install by using command options, see output
of "python setup.py <command> --help", example:

        python setup.py install --help

Options can also be set in file "setup.cfg".


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you get the following error during build_ext:

        include/edje/c_edje.pxd:1:8: 'evas.c_evas.pxd' not found

Means that either evas/c_evas.pxd was not installed or it is placed
at an non-standard place.

If it's not installed at all, please do so by:

        # copy and extract python-evas to 'src/python-evas', then:
        cd src/python-evas
        # read README
        python setup.py install_headers

If it's installed at a non-standard place, you can specify the same path you
used to install python-evas to build_ext with "--include-dirs":

        python setup.py build_ext --include-dirs <path>
