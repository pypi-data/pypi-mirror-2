1. Introduction
===============

DjangoDE is an integrated development environment designed specifically for
building websites using the Django framework.

2. Requirements
===============

DjangoDE requires the following packages

Linux (any recent distribution will do)
Python 2.7 (untested, but probably works in 2.5 and 2.6)
Qt 4.7 (untested, but probably works in some earlier versions)
PyQt 4.7 (untested, but probably works in some earlier versions)
Django 1.2 (untested, but probably works with some earlier or later versions)

3. Installation
===============

The simplest way of installing DjangoDE is simply to run:

easy_install djangode

Alternatively, you can visit http://code.google.com/p/djangode/downloads/list

6. Thanks

I would like to extend my thanks to the Django and Python communities for
creating some amazing software that is a joy to develop with.

I would also like to thank Trolltech/Noika and Riverbank Computing for
creating such an easy to use GUI toolkit.
