Description: ==================
        django-hex-storage
        ==================
        
        File system storage with support of international file names and same file names.
        
        For example:
        
        1. You can upload to your server files with russian or turkish names. Such files will be urlified.
            
            ``Документ 1.doc`` becomes ``document_1.doc``
        
        2. You can upload files with same names. Such files will have names with different random hex postfixes.
        
            Different files ``1.png`` and ``1.png`` becomes ``1.png`` and ``1_1BAC45.png`` rather than 
            ``1.png`` and ``1_.png`` in Django default filestorage
        
        Installation:
        =============
        
        1. Put ``hex_storage`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py`` within your django project. ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'hex_storage',
                ...
            ]
        
        2. Set your default file storage in your ``settings.py``::
        
            DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'hex_storage.HexFileSystemStorage'
