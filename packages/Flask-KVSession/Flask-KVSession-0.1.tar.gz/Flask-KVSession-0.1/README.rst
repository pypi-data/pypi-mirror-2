Flask-KVSession is a drop-in replacement for `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_'s signed cookie-based session management. Instead of storing data on the client, only a securely generated ID is stored on the client, which the actual session data resides on the server.

This has two major advantages:

* Clients no longer see the session information
* It is possible to securely destroy sessions. Even if the session cookie is copied, it is no longer possible to use it as a valid session.

Other things are possible with server side session that are impossible with clients side sessions, like inspecting and manipulating data in absence of the client. The drawback is that sessions need to be stored. Flask-KVSession uses the simplekv-package for storing session data on a variety of backends.

Integration with Flask is seemless, once the extension is loaded for a Flask application, it transparently replaces (or rather, extends) Flask's own Session class for this instance. Any application working with sessions should work the same with Flask-KVSession.

Flask-KVSession has good unit test coverage and documentation available at `http://flask-kvsession.readthedocs.org`_.
