Development
===========

The package is its own buildout you can install.

In order to run the tests of the package, just do::

  bin/test

If you also want to run the performance tests run::

  bin/test -a 2

Release
=======

In order to build a release, you need to regenerate the Cython based C code.
To do so run::

  bin/cython experimental/btree/difference.pyx
  bin/cython experimental/btree/intersection.pyx

To regenerate the C extensions, you can run::

  python2.6 setup.py build_ext -if
