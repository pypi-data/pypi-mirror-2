Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This library provides experimental code to speed up BTree difference and
        intersection functions, as used by the ZCatalog.
        
        It's been extracted out from
        `experimental.catalogqueryplan <https://github.com/Jarn/experimental.catalogqueryplan>`_
        now that the query plan implementation has been moved to ZCatalog itself.
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        To test, import the monkey patch in other tests, like CMFPlone::
        
         import experimental.btree
        
        and run the test.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Development of this project takes place at:
        https://github.com/Jarn/experimental.btree
