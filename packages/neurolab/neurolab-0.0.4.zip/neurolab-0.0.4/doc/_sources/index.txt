Welcome to NeuroLab's documentation!
====================================
NeuroLab - a library of basic nueral networks algorithms with flexible network configurations and learning algorithms. 
To simplify migration, the syntax of the library is as close to a package of Neural Network Toolbox (NNT) of MATLAB (c). 
The library is based on the package numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org), some learning algorithms are used scipy.optymyze (http://scipy.org).
