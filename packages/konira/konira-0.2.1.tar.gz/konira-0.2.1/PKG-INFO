        Konira - A Python DSL Testing Framework
        =======================================
        Konira is a tool that allows you to write minimalistic
        descriptions for testing scenarios and unit tests.
        
        It is flexible enough to accommodate Behavioral Driven
        Development as well as traditional Unit Testing.
        
        
        
        What does a test case look like?
        ------------------------------------
        
        
        ::
        
        describe "a very simple test case for my_module":
        
        it "has a foo property that is True":
        assert my_module.foo
        
        
        But this is not valid Python!
        ---------------------------------
        
        I hear you. It is a DSL. All tests need to specify the ``konira`` encoding
        at the top and they can be executed with the included command line tool.
        
        fast and readable action in the terminal
        --------------------------------------------
        
        
        ::
        
        $ konira
        
        a very simple test case for my_module
        It has a foo property that is True
        
        
        All specs passed in 0.000 secs.
        
        
        Are you sold yet?

        The name
        ------------
        
        *Konira* is one of the names of an ancient Inca God. Konira Wirakocha diguised
        as a traveler in rags. A trickster, a prankster. No one knew who he was, and the
        people he passed called him names. Yet as he walked, he created. With a word he
        made the fields and terraced hillsides. Dropping a reed blossom, he made water flow.
        
        This is a DSL, it looks like Python - it mostly is, but it packs simplicity and makes
        testing look good and easy.
