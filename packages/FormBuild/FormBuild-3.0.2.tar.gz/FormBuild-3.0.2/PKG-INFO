        ---
        
        FormBuild 3 is a complete from-the-ground-up re-write of FormBuild 2 with
        deliberately more limited scope but increased real-world usefuleness.
        
        Major changes since previous version:
        
        * Removal of the ``formbuild.helpers`` module
        * Removal of dependency on ``WebHelpers``
        * Removal of all previously deprecated code
        * Renaming the ``values``, ``errors``, ``state`` and ``options`` argument to
          ``Form`` to ``value``, ``error``, ``flow`` and ``option`` respectively
        * Removal of ability to set values, or options at design time
        * Introduction of a ``checked`` argument to ``Form`` to determine whether 
          checkboxes are checked or not at form execution time, not based on values
          or at design time
        * The ``id`` attribute is no longer automatically generated based on the name
          and the ``type`` attribute comes before ``name`` for ``<input>`` fields
        * Added doctests for all fields
        * Added full documentation
        
        2.2.1
        -----
        
        2009-10-20
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added helpers for ``combo()`` and ``dropdown()``
        * Refactored the options code for using a dropdown in a field
        * Started updating the documentation 
        * Removed some old comments, moved deprecated code to the end
        
        2.2.0
        -----
        
        2009-10-04
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added the ability of ``select()`` to use the new ``options`` infrastructure.
        * Updated the ``MANIFEST.in`` file to include tests and docs in the source
          distribution.
        * Moved the ``formbuild.helpers`` doctest code into the main ``doc.py`` test.
        
        2009-08-20
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Made the use of the ``default`` argument raise an Exception instead of 
          logging an error
        
        2009-08-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added some documentation tests
        * Changed ``checkbox_group()`` and ``radio_group()`` to take a ``sub_name``
          argument for formatting fields according to a NestedRecord structure.
        * The ``combo()`` and ``checkbox_group()`` fields can now take options from
          those passed to the ``Form`` object constructor.
        * Added Sphinx code
        * Made ``checkbox_group()`` and ``radio_group()`` XHTML compatible by using
          the attribute ``checked="checked"``.
        * Allowed the ``checkbox()`` to also be able to get its value from the
          ``options`` argument  passed to the ``Form`` constructor and determine
          whether not it is ticked from a ``True`` or ``False`` value in the ``values``
          argument passed to the ``Form`` constructor.
        
        2.1.3
        -----
        
        2009-07-13
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Used CSS for spacing of required asterix
        * Added an options argument to Form instead of individual fields having
          options
        
        2.1.2
        -----
        
        * Added a stricter ``errors_to_dict()`` function that catches errors such as
          forgetting ``allow_extra_fields``, ``filter_extra_fields``.
        * Added a values_to_dict() function for encoding values
        * Added a .validation_state attribute and ValidationState class.
        * The title() field and action bar now have a colspan of 3
        
        2.1.1
        -----
        
        * Added a title() field to the Form

        * Updated the tests
        * Added a style used for padding to the labels in checkbox groups.
