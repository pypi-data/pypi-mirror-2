        =====================
        
        :url:
        The URL of the archive to download.
        
        :strip-top-level-dir: (optional)
        Whether to remove the top-level directory from the extracted archive
        contents.
        
        :md5sum:
        MD5 checksum of the archive.
        
        :destination:
        Where to put the extracted archive contents.
        
        :download-directory: (optional)
        Where to put the downloaded archive.
        
        This option uses a buildout option of the same name as a default if that
        is specified.
        
        
        Caching
        =======
        
        The download directory, if given, acts as a cache. In addition,
        gocept.download takes advantage of zc.buildout's download cache.
