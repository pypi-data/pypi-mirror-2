Building the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can build the documentation locally. In order to build the html documentation you need to install `Sphinx`_. Simply run::

    $ pyg install sphinx

Again, you may need root privileges.
Now you can build the docs. If you haven't already downloaded the source download it and open your terminal::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

The docs are now in ``_build/html/``
