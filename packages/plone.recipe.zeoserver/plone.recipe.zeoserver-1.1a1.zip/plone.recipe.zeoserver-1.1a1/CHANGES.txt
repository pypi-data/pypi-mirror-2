Change History
==============

1.1a1 - 2010-04-27
------------------

- Added support for the ``pack-gc`` option introduced in ZODB 3.9.
  [hannosch]

- Always create a blob-storage by default.
  [hannosch]

- Require at least ZODB 3.8 and simplify the ``zeopack`` script.
  [hannosch]

- Various documentation updates.
  [hannosch]

- Use the new ``zope.mkzeoinstance`` package, which makes the recipe compatible
  with ZODB 3.9.5+.
  [hannosch]

- Removed unmaintained win32 specific tests and old zope2 test mockups.
  [hannosch]

- Removed testing dependency on ``zope.testing`` and refactored testing setup.
  [hannosch]

1.0 - 2010-04-05
----------------

- Depend on and always include ZopeUndo. While it's only needed for Zope 2, the
  distribution is so tiny, it doesn't hurt for non-Zope 2 ZEO servers.
  [hannosch]

1.0b1 - 2010-03-19
------------------

- Fixed issue with egg paths for the zeopack script.
  [davisagli]

  [baijum]

1.0a2 - 2009-12-03
------------------

* Set up logging configuration that is needed by ZODB.blob.
  [davisagli]

* Set shared_blob_dir to True when initializing the ClientStorage used
  by the pack script, since it will be using the same blob directory
  as the ZEO server.
  [davisagli]

1.0a1 - 2009-12-03
------------------

* Updated and cleaned up after renaming.
  [hannosch]

* Added compatibility with eggified Zopes (Zope >= 2.12).
  [davisagli]

* Initial implementation based on plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver.
  [plone]
