Description: plone.recipe.zeoserver
        ======================
        
        This recipe creates and configures a ZEO server in parts. It also
        installs a control script, which is like zeoctl, in the bin/ directory.
        The name of the control script is the the name of the part in buildout.
        
        You can use it with a part like this::
        
        [zeoserver]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zeoserver
        zeo-address = 8100
        
        Options
        -------
        
        zeopack
        The path to the zeopack.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
        generated in bin/zeopack, which sets up the appropriate environment to
        run this. Defaults to using the zeopack script from the ZODB3 egg.
        Set this option to an empty value if you do not want this script to be
        generated.
        
        repozo
        The path to the repozo.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
        generated in bin/repozo, which sets up the appropriate environment for
        running this. Defaults to using the repozo script from the ZODB3 egg.
        Set this to an empty value if you do not want this script to be generated.
        
        zeo-conf
        A relative or absolute path to a zeo.conf file. If this is not given, a
        zeo.conf will be generated based on the the options below.
        
        The following options all affect the generated zope.conf.
        
        zeo-address
        Give a port for the ZEO server (either specify the port number only (with
        'localhost' as default) or you use the format ``host:port``). Defaults to 8100.
        
        effective-user
        The name of the effective user for the ZEO process. Defaults to not setting
        an effective user.
        
        invalidation-queue-size
        The invalidation-queue-size used for the ZEO server. Defaults to 100.
        
        zeo-log
        The filename of the ZEO log file. Defaults to var/log/${partname}.log
        
        zeo-log-format
        Format of logfile entries. Defaults to %(asctime)s %(message)s
        
        zeo-log-custom
        A custom section for the eventlog, to be able to use another
        event logger than `logfile`. `zeo-log` is still used to set the logfile
        value in the runner section.
        
        storage-number
        The number used to identify a storage.
        
        file-storage
        The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
        Defaults to var/filestorage/Data.fs.
        
        blob-storage
        The folder where the ZODB blob data files will be stored.
        
        socket-name
        The filename where ZEO will write its socket file.
        Defaults to var/zeo.zdsock.
        
        authentication-database
        The filename for a authentication database. Only accounts listed in this
        database will be allowed to access the ZEO server.
        
        The format of the database file is::
        
        realm <realm>
        <username>:<hash>
        
        Where the hash is generated via::
        
        import sha
        string = "%s:%s:%s" % (username, realm, password)
        sha.new(string).hexdigest()
        
        authentication-realm
        The authentication realm. Defaults to 'ZEO'
        
        pack-days
        Specify of days for the zeopack script to retain of history. Defaults to
        one day.
        
        pack-user
        If the ZEO server uses authentication, this is the username used by the
        zeopack script to connect to the ZEO server.
        
        pack-password
        If the ZEO server uses authentication, this is the password used by the
        zeopack script to connect to the ZEO server.
        
        zeo-conf-additional
        Give additional lines to zeo.conf. Make sure you indent any lines after
        the one with the parameter.
        
        monitor-address
        The address at which the monitor server should listen.
        The monitor server provides server statistics in a simple text format.
        
        relative-paths
        Set this to `true` to make the generated scripts use relative
        paths. You can also enable this in the `[buildout]` section.
        
        eggs
        Set if you need to include other packages as eggs e.g. for making
        application code available on the ZEO server side for performing
        conflict resolution (through the _p_resolveConflict() handler).

        1.0b1 - 2010-03-19
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed issue with egg paths for the zeopack script.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Added support for setting ZEO log level.
        [baijum]
        
        1.0a2 - 2009-12-03
        ------------------
        
        * Set up logging configuration that is needed by ZODB.blob.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Set shared_blob_dir to True when initializing the ClientStorage used
        by the pack script, since it will be using the same blob directory
        as the ZEO server.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.0a1 - 2009-12-03

        * Added compatibility with eggified Zopes (Zope >= 2.12).
        [davisagli]
        
        * Initial implementation based on plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver.
