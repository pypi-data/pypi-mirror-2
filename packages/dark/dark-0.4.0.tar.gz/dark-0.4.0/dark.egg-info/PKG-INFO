Description: `Dark` is an acronym for "Data Analysis and Reporting Kit". It helps find
        patterns in a set of irregular (mixed) data, sort various documents and pile
        them in stacks by certain properties, define schemata for existing data, build
        pivot tables and calculate various aggregates. Great for CSV, JSON, etc.
        
        Initially written by Andy Mikhailenko in 2009 with invaluable feedback from
        Ilya Musabirov. See the file AUTHORS for a complete authors list of this
        application.
