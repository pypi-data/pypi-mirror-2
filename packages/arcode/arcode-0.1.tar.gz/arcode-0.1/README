DESCRIPTION:
-----------
This archive contains a python package that includes a class implementing
arithmetic coding and decoding.  This implementation is not intended to be
the best, fastest, smallest, or any other performance related adjective.

FILES
-----
__init__.py     - Python package initializtion code for acode
arcode.py       - File containg a Class implementing the arithmetic
                  encoding and decoding algorithms.
COPYING         - GNU General Public License v3
README          - This file
sample.py       - Sample usage.
setup.py        - distutils setup file.

INSTALLING
----------
This package is dependent on the BitFile package.  A current version may be
obtained from the Python Package Index (http://pypi.python.org/) or
http://michael.dipperstein.com/bitlibs/

Install the BitFile package prior to installing this package.

This package uses distutils.  The package may be installed with the following
command:
python setup.py install

USAGE
-----
arcode.py is fully documented with docstrings.  Use your favorite tool for
generating documentation from docstrings.

arcode.py also contains a simple unit test, which may be performed when the
package is executed with the following command:
python arcode.py

sample.py demonstrates usage of the ArithmaticCode methods for encoding and
decoding files.

The following commands will encode a file:
import arcode
ar = arcode.ArithmeticCode(use_static_model)
ar.encode_file(input_file, output_file)

Where input_file and output_file are the names of the file to be encoded and
file that will contain the results of the encoding.

The following commands will decode a file:
import arcode
ar = arcode.ArithmeticCode(use_static_model)
ar.decode_file(input_file, output_file)

Where input_file and output_file are the names of the file to be decoded and
file that will contain the results of the decoding.

HISTORY
-------
08/06/10 - Initial release
