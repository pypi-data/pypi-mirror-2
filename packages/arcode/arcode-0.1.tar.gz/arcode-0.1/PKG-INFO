        ====================
        ArithmeticCode Class
        ====================
        Description
        -----------
        This archive contains a python package that includes a class implementing
        arithmetic coding and decoding.  This implementation is not intended to be
        the best, fastest, smallest, or any other performance related adjective.

        __init__.py     - Python package initializtion code for bitfile.
        arcode.py       - File containing a Class implementing the arithmetic encoding and decoding algorithms.

        setup.py        - distutils setup file.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        This package is dependent on the BitFile package.  A current version may be
        obtained from the Python Package Index (http://pypi.python.org/) or
        http://michael.dipperstein.com/bitlibs/
        
        Install the BitFile package prior to installing this package.
        
        This package uses distutils.  The package may be installed with the following
        command::
        
        python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        arcode.py is fully documented with docstrings.  Use your favorite tool for
        generating documentation from docstrings.
        
        arcode.py also contains a simple unit test, which may be performed when the
        package is executed with the following command:
        python arcode.py
        
        sample.py demonstrates usage of the ArithmaticCode methods for encoding and
        decoding files.
        
        The following commands will encode a file:
        import arcode::
        
        ar = arcode.ArithmeticCode(use_static_model)
        ar.encode_file(input_file, output_file)
        
        Where *input_file* and *output_file* are the names of the file to be encoded and
        file that will contain the results of the encoding.
        
        The following commands will decode a file:
        import arcode::
        
        ar = arcode.ArithmeticCode(use_static_model)
        ar.decode_file(input_file, output_file)
        
        Where *input_file* and *output_file* are the names of the file to be decoded and
        file that will contain the results of the decoding.
