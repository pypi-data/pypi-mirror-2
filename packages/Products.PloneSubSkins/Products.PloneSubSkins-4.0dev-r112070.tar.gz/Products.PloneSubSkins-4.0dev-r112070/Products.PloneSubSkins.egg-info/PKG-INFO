Description: This product provides a control panel to be used by subskins, a Plone product that
        provides many css and color schemes to customize the site layout.
        Together, the two allow quick and easy customization of the Plone skin.
        If you want this functionality, you should install medealog.subskins.
        It will pull this product as a dependency.
        If you want to write a product similar to subskins read ahead.
        
        PloneSubSkins allows to switch to specific CSS files handling such or such aspects of your Plone skin.
        
        By default, this hacked version of PloneSubSkins manage the following categories:
        - Base
        - Top
        - Navigation
        - Text
        - Global navigation
        - Portlets
        - Bottom
        - Extra (multiple choices)
        
        Another category is dedicated to manage your different base_properties files, named MySkin_colorschemes.
        
        To use PloneSubSkin you just need to respect the following naming convention:
        1 - if your skin product is named MySkin, the navigation-related CSS must be stored in a sub-folder named MySkin_navigation,
        text related CCS must be in MySkin_text, etc.
        
        It will produce the following directory structure:
        /Products
        /MySkin
        /skins
        /MySkin
        main_template.pt
        some.gif
        other.pt
        /MySkin_colorschemes
        bluetheme_base_properties.prop
        yellowtheme_base_properties.prop
        /MySkin_navigation
        navYellow.css
        navYellow2.css
        /MySkin_text
        small.css
        normal.css
        all_arial.css
        /MySkin_globalnav
        globalnav.css
        globalnavOld.css
        /MySkin_calendar
        cal1.css
        cal2.css
        etc.
        
        2 - In your css files, add the following line:
        <dtml-with get_base_properties mapping>
        before the existing line:
        <dtml-with base_properties> (do not remove this)
        and add the line
        /* </dtml-with> */
        at the end of the file
        
        3 - Depend on this product in your metadata.xml
        4 - Put a file named subskins_choices.xml in your profile directory
        
        You can modify those categories or add your own ones by editing /Products/PloneSubSkins/AppConfig.py
