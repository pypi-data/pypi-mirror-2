Description: NEW in 1.10: ``@whenImported`` can now be used as a decorator for lazy imports
        
        Need to import an object when all you've got is its name?  Need to lazily
        import modules, such that they don't actually get loaded until you use them?
        Want to have some code in a module that only gets run *if* another module is
        imported?  Then you need the "Importing" toolkit.
        
        Installing the toolkit (using ``"easy_install Importing"`` or
        ``"setup.py install"``) allows you to access the ``peak.util.imports`` module.
        This module was previously bundled for years inside of the general PEAK
        distribution, but is now available as a standalone module for your convenience.
        
        The "Importing" toolkit does not install or use any special import hooks, and
        is compatible with zipfile imports, ``py2exe``, etc.  Lazy and weak imports
        should be compatible with almost any import hooks or hacks, as long as they
        have reasonable support for the ``reload()`` builtin.  The dynamic import
        utilities, however, require only that ``__import__()`` work correctly, and so
        should work anywhere that normal Python imports work.
        
        NOTE: The 1.9.2 release uses a new version of setuptools (0.6b3) that
        fixes a previous problem with .pth files on Windows with the ``Importing``
        egg.  See `more info on how to fix your existing installation
        <http://www.eby-sarna.com/pipermail/peak/2006-May/002550.html>`_, if you
        experienced this problem with a previous version.
        
        Python 2.3 users: If you are using weak or lazy importing with zipfiles (e.g.
        eggs) you *must* have Python **2.3.5**.  Lesser versions of 2.3 have a bug in
        the ``reload()`` implementation which prevents correct operation of weak and
        lazy imports for modules that are inside zipfiles.
