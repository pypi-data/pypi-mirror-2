        ==============================
        
        This recipe creates a zope.testing_ test runner script which supports code
        coverage analysis using the coverage_ python library.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        eggs
        
        The eggs option specified a list of eggs to test given as one ore more
        setuptools requirement strings.  Each string must be given on a separate
        line.
        
        script-name
        
        The script option gives the name of the script to generate, in the buildout
        bin directory.  Of the option isn't used, the part name will be used.
        
        extra-paths
        
        One or more extra paths to include in the generated test script.
        
        defaults
        
        The defaults option lets you specify testrunner default options.
        
        working-directory
        
        The working-directory option lets to specify a directory where the tests
        will run. The testrunner will change to this directory when run. If the
        working directory is the empty string or not specified at all, the recipe
        will create a working directory among the parts.
        
        environment
        
        A set of environment variables that should be exported before starting the
        tests.
        
        initialization
        
        Provide initialization code to run before running tests.
        
        relative-paths
        
        Use egg, test, and working-directory paths relative to the test script.
        
        This is a minimal ''buildout.cfg'' file which creates a test runner::
        
        [test]
        recipe = tranchitella.recipe.testrunner
        eggs = myapplication
        
        [test-coverage]
        recipe = tranchitella.recipe.testrunner
        eggs = myapplication
        defaults = ['--coverage-module', 'myapplication', '--coverage-branch']
