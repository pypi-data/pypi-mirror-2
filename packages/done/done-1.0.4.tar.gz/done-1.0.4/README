done -- a simple, elegant command line todo list tool

done is a todo list tool designed for me. You might enjoy it, as well.

It was inspired by:
    the darcs UI
    timebook.py
    todo.sh
    remember the milk
    kOrganizer
and aims to distill my favorite aspects of each of these tools into one, useful tool.

It was initially written in Haskell as a pedagogical exercise. I found that I
was beginning to rely on it but was having trouble getting into Haskell enough
to really make it code I was proud of. So I rewrote it in Python.

It uses sqlite3.
