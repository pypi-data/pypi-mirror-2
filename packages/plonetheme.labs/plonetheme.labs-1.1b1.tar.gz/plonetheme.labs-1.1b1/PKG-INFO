Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        An installable theme for Plone targeting intranet-like sites.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Assuming that you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, proceed this way:
        
        * Add plonetheme.labs to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        plonetheme.labs
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
        ::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        
        Then you can install the product into your Plone site from the Plone control
        panel.
        
        In Plone 4, if you uninstall plonetheme.labs you will notice that the site will
        start looking very raw in style. This is because 'Plone Default' is set as
        default skin after uninstallation. To change the default skin you need to go to
        the Themes tool in the control panel and select a default skin different from
        'Plone Default'.
