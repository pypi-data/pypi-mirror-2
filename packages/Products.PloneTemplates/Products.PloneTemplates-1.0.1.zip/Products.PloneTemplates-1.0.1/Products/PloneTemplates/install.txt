Installing PloneTemplates
-------------------------

PloneTemplates requires Plone 2.5.

In ZMI go to the QuickInstaller and install PloneTemplates.
In config.py you can add types to enable folderish objects for templates.

After you install this Product, go to zmi, and find archetype_tool. There
you have to update the schema for all types that are made template aware (see
the readme). Initially this will be ATFolder only. Select 'all objects' from the
selection box at the bottom of this page.
