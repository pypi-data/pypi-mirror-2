Woven assumes you have Django already installed. And you are using pip and virtualenv right?

    ``pip install woven``
    
.. note::
    
    Fabric 0.9 comes bundled with paramiko 1.7.4. The bundled version of paramiko has `issues <http://code.fabfile.org/issues/show/158>`_. You should delete the bundled version from your installed Fabric in the site-packages. Failure to do this may cause your terminal session to *hang* at the end of executing woven. Hopefully Fabric will be released unbundled soon.

You may also want to install the following recommended packages::

    pip install south
    pip install django-staticfiles
    
To use woven add ``woven`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``
