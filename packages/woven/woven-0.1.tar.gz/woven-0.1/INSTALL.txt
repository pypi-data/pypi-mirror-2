If you have downloaded woven to install it, run the following command inside
this directory::

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step::

   easy_install woven

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install woven
    
.. note::
    
    Fabric 0.9 comes bundled with paramiko 1.7.4. The bundled version of paramiko has `issues <http://code.fabfile.org/issues/show/158>`_. You should delete the bundled version from your installed Fabric in the site-packages. Failure to do this may cause your terminal session to *hang* at the end of executing woven. Hopefully Fabric will be released unbundled soon.


Requirements
============

Woven requires Fabric >= 0.9
