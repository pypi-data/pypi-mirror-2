        ============
        
        This egg contain some paste templates to help to build a plone architecture
        with as less knowledge as possible about python and Plone. The first target is 
        Debian Lenny up-to-date with the lenny-backports repository enabled. In a 
        second time Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu LTS should be added. No ReadHat, Suse , 
        Mandriva or any RPM-based linux is in the roadmap.
