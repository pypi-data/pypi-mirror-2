Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This egg contain some paste templates to help to build a plone architecture
        with as less knowledge as possible about python and Plone. The first target is 
        Debian Lenny up-to-date with the lenny-backports repository enabled. In a 
        second time Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu LTS should be added. No ReadHat, Suse , 
        Mandriva or any RPM-based linux is in the roadmap.
        
        The docs directory contains all necessary steps about server configuration
        before to install this egg. These documents can be distributed separately under
        the specified license in each of them. 
        
        These templates was initiated by the UNIS Team of the ENS de Lyon 
        <unis@ens-lyon.fr> and by Quadra Informatique <plone@quadra-informatique.fr>.
