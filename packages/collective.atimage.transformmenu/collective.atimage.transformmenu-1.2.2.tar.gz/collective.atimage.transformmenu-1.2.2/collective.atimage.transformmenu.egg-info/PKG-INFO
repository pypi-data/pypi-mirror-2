Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Replaces the "Transform" tab in ATImage with a corresponding "Transform" menu in the "View" tab.
        The menu is available also for ATNewsItem.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Menu available for Image and News Item
        - Performs image transformations with AJAX to prevent reloading the page
        - Degrades gracefully in non-JavaScript browsers
        - i18n support by using atcontentypes and plone i18n domains.
        - Tested in Plone 3.3.5 and Plone 4.0
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add ``collective.atimage.transformmenu`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.atimage.transformmenu
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.atimage.transformmenu
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
        the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
