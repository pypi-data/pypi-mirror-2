Description: WSGIProxy gives tools to proxy arbitrary(ish) WSGI requests to other
        processes over HTTP.
        
        This will encode the WSGI request CGI-style environmental variables
        (which must be strings), plus a configurable set of other variables.
        It also sends values like ``HTTP_HOST`` and ``wsgi.url_scheme`` which
        are often obscured by the proxying process, as well as values like
        ``SCRIPT_NAME``.  On the receiving end, a WSGI middleware fixes up the
        environment to represent the state of the original request.  This
        makes HTTP more like FastCGI or SCGI, which naturally preserve these
        values.
