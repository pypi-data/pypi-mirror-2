Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        To make a long story short: sometimes you need to break into the debugger in the
        middle of a Script (Python). To prevent the frustrating ``Unauthorized: import
        of 'pdb' is unauthorized`` message, use this enablesettrace package.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The installation is as simple as making sure the package is located on the
        Python path. For example when you are using zc.buildout list
        ``Products.enablesettrace`` in the ``eggs`` section::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        Products.enablesettrace
