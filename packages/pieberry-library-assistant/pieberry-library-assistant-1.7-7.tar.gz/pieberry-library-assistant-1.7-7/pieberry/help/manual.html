<p>Pieberry combines aspects of the functionality of a download manager,
a bibliography database, a desktop search program and an archival file
manager in a way which I consider most useful for a professional
researcher in Government.

<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Pieberry as download manager (&amp; setting up) </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
The first and earliest functionality of Pieberry is its download
management ability. Dealing with masses of uncatalogued PDF documents
from websites is a pain. Good practice is to catalogue them yourself
but this is very labour intensive. Pieberry helps to automate this to
the greatest extent possible and assist you building a <i>library</i> of
these documents.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1.1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Setting up </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.1">


<p>
To use Pieberry as a download manager - you need to tell it where your
library will be. To do this, go to <b>File -&gt; Settings</b>, and nominate a
suitable directory under "Root directory for library". This will be
where all the subdirectories containing your files will live.
</p>
<p>
You should also select a (existing or new) bibliography file for
storing the bibliographic information for your downloaded files. This
file ought to use a .bib extension, which corresponds to a BibTeX
format.
</p>
<p>
Other options include selecting the default entry type, and specifying
that Pieberry should also write bibliographic information for
downloaded files to a tab-separated-value format spreadsheet.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1.2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Downloading PDFs </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.2">


<p>
Pieberry will scan a web page for any recognisable links to PDF
documents and download them.
</p>
<p>
Files will be downloaded to your library directory, in subdirectories
organised in the following hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Library (root directory for library)
</p><ul>
<li>
Author (the generic 'author' you specify for a given page)
<ul>
<li>
Category (the subject/category phrase you specify for a given page)
<ul>
<li>
Type (some particular types of document will be further stored in
these subdirectories, such as submissions from interested parties)

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To scan and download PDFs:
</p><ol>
<li>
Type or paste a URL into the URL text box at the top of the main
Pieberry screen. It will turn pink if it is not a valid URL.
</li>
<li>
Specify the common author for the documents in the next field -
usually the person or organisation running the web site. If the
documents on the page are authored by other people don't worry,
you can change this later.
</li>
<li>
If the common author is an organisation rather than persons,
ensuring the "corporate author" checkbox to the right is check will
ensure that the name you specify is treated as a single name,
rather than first and surnames.
</li>
<li>
Pieberry will try to guess the 'category' phrase in the next field
from the title of the web page. If it can't or gets it wrong,
change it.
</li>
<li>
To the right, there is a choice box allowing you to select
different ways to append the category phrase to the titles of all
documents you downloaded, or not to (it will still be used as the
download directory though). This is useful if the documents' titles
are generic things like "Final Determination", when what you
actually want is "Final Determination - Rainfall review".
</li>
<li>
Once you're satisfied with the settings you've chosen, click the
'Scan' button. (It will turn to an 'Abort' button for the
duration). Pieberry will now start downloading all PDFs, and will
show them in the list view at the bottom of the screen. 

</li>
</ol>

<p>As Pieberry tries to get the documents, it will show how it went by
either marking them with a blue dot and 'success' if the download was
successful, a red X and 'fail' if it couldn't download them, and a
green 'X' and 'already downloaded' if a document of the same name
already exists.
</p>
<p>
BUG ALERT: if there are multiple different documents with the same
title, Pieberry will assume they are all the same and only download
the first. 
</p>
<p>
When Pieberry downloads documents it will rename them to a title with
a date prefix reflecting the file's creation date, and the document's
title to aid archival and retrieval in the format:
</p>
<p>
YYYYMMDD TITLE.pdf 
</p>
<p>
Once Pieberry finishes downloading, the files are all downloaded but
nothing has yet been done to your bibliography - you can make changes
to the information associated with the files before saving them to
your bibliography.
</p>
<p>
To work with the documents, right click on them to bring up a context
menu. There you will be able to:
</p><ul>
<li>
Open the document in your PDF viewer
</li>
<li>
Open the folder where the document was stored
</li>
<li>
Delete the document and forget about it
</li>
<li>
Edit the bibliographic information associated with the document
</li>
<li>
Specify whether the document should be excluded from your
bibliography (it remains on disk but uncatalogued - this is useful
for not cluttering up your bibliography with appendices or other
trivial documents. Some documents are excluded by default, like
submissions).

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are satisfied that all the information specified is more or
less correct, select <b>File -&gt; Save bibliography</b> to commit all the
information to your bibliography.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1.3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Editing bibliography information </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.3">


<p>
If, on the other hand, something is wrong - say there's a document
whose author is different from the generic one you specified for the
web page, select 'Edit bibliography entry' to bring up an editing
dialog.
</p>
<p>
The editing dialog consists of controls for specifying:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The BibTeX key for the given document - it is best to leave the
'auto-generate' box checked here unless you have a specific reason
for choosing your own key.
</li>
<li>
The author. If the PDF itself has a different author specified in
it, it will be displayed in the field to the right. Click the button
between them to substitute one for the other. 
</li>
<li>
The title. Pieberry guesses this from the text of the webpage
links. Again if the PDF has a different title specified within it,
this is displayed to the right. 
</li>
<li>
The date of publication - Pieberry always takes this from the
creation date of the PDF file, if possible (but may use the current
date if it couldn't figure it out).
</li>
<li>
The class of document - by default, this is a generic web type of
document, either 'Misc' or 'Online'. You can select from a range of
other BibTeX-recognised document classes including articles, books
and collections. 

</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE: to change the default document type, select one of the options</b>
<b>in the File -&gt; Settings dialog</b> 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The fields below here will depend on the class of document
selected. Mandatory fields will turn pink if they are
unfilled. Optional fields are coloured yellow.

</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NOTE: Ensure that if you use curly braces ("{}") that they are always</b>
<b>evenly matched to avoid confusing BibTeX, should you use it.</b>
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Pieberry uses the 'Annote' field to store additional
information about the document, in particular, where it was saved
to. If you use a BibTeX style that uses the Annote field (very few)
then this may be unwelcome. Deleting it is not harmful, but it will
mean that Pieberry won't be able to open your documents for you in the
PDF viewer.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Pieberry as bibliography manager </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Pieberry uses the <a href="http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/">Pybtex</a> backend to manipulate BibTeX files. This
allows some bibliographic management ability in Pieberry. Pieberry,
however, is <b>not</b> a fully featured bibliography manager. To work with
BibTeX files <i>en-masse</i> I would recommend <a href="http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">JabRef</a>. For day-to-day
tasks, however, Pieberry gets the job done.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Finding documents </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.1">


<p>
To find documents that are already in your bibliography, select <b>Tools -&gt; Find items in bibliography</b>, or do Ctrl-F. This will bring up a
search dialog. The search dialog uses a simple syntax to search your
bibliography:
</p>
<p>
"field1==term1;term2, field2==term3"
</p>
<p>
You can search a given field like "title", "author" or "year" by
typing "title==" etc. As a shortcut, the first letter can be used
e.g. "t==". Following the "==" should be the terms you're looking for,
separated by semicolons. After these, you can put a comma, and specify
another field if needs be. 
</p>
<p>
The search will try to find the 25 documents most nearly satisfying
all your search terms. 
</p>
<p>
NOTE: this is a nearest-match type search, not a limiting
search. Specifying multiple fields will increase, rather than decrease
the number of documents matched, but should put the ones you want at
the top of the list. I will tackle limiting search at some point.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Editing bibliography entries </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.2">


<p>
When you search, any matched documents will appear in the list
view. Right-click and select 'Edit bibliography entry' to edit. It
will not be saved immediately. Select <b>File -&gt; Save bibliography</b> or
Ctrl-S to save any entries you've edited. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Adding other documents </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.3">


<p>
To create a new bibliography entry without necessarily having a file
for it, select <b>Tools -&gt; Create new (empty) bibliography entry</b>.
</p>
<p>
To create a bibliography entry for the web page in the URL field
itself, rather than any documents attached to it, select <b>Tools -&gt; Create reference for top-level page</b>.
</p>
<p>
You can also drag and drop PDF files into Pieberry, which will open up
a bibliography edit window to allow you to add it to your library.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Citing documents </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.4">


<p>
You may now wish to cite documents in your bibliography in a paper
you're writing. If you're a LaTeX user you can use the bibliography
file to feed into BibTeX through the usual process (consult BibTeX
documentation).
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Pieberry will save .bib files in utf-8 format. This can cause
problems with BibTeX when non-ASCII characters appear in its
fields. At a minimum, use \inputenc{utf-8}. Preferably you might use a
utf-8 friendly version of BibTeX like Biber or Pybtex. 
</p>
<p>
To get a citation directly from Pieberry, right click on a document,
and select the 'Copy' submenu, under which there are the options 'Copy
citation to clipboard' in html and text format. Selecting one of these
should put a well formatted citation into the clipboard for you to
paste into a document. 
</p>
<p>
NOTE: The format of the citation is not customisable at this point.
</p>
<p>
The html version of this operation will embed the URL of your
document, if it has one, as a hyperlink in the citation to make your
sources more easily accessible to your readers. This is particularly
useful in MS Word.
</p>
<p>
You may also copy the BibTeX key of the document to the clipboard for
working with LaTeX, or the original URL of the document. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Pieberry as desktop organiser </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
In addition to managing a bibliography, Pieberry also has
functionality to help manage working documents, through the actions
under the 'Desktop cleaner' menu.
</p>
<p>
The general principle here is that many of us end up dumping a lot of
documents onto the Desktop and filing them appropriately becomes a
chore. Pieberry semi-automates this process, allowing you to file
things in a 'projects' directory.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: The 'projects' directory and your 'library' are separate and
distinct directories, reflecting that 'projects' contain a lot of
working documents, while the 'library' contains final, published,
documents that you may wish to cite. 
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Organising your desktop </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.1">


<p>
Every time you open the <b>Desktop cleaner -&gt; Process files from desktop</b> window, Pieberry will 'sweep' all the PDF and MS WORD files
on it into a temporary directory. 
</p>
<p>
It will then populate the desktop cleaner window with a line of
controls for each file, allowing you to select where they should be
filed and under what name. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Setting up the desktop cleaner </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.2">


<p>
Under <b>Desktop cleaner -&gt; Desktop cleaner settings</b> you can set up the
various subdirectories (project folders) that you would like to file
into. 
</p>
<p>
For each directory, you can specify keywords for authors and titles,
that correspond to that directory. The desktop cleaner will use these
to suggest a suitable directory. 
</p>
<p>
You should also select your projects directory and your desktop
directory in the corresponding fields.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Using the desktop cleaner </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.3">


<p>
For each file, you can do the following things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mouse over the icon to the left - this will present a tooltip with
relevant file metadata for your information.
</li>
<li>
Select a destination folder from the list of folders you set up in
the desktop cleaner settings. If the file metadata matches any of
the terms you associated with a directory, then it should already
have an automatic recommendation for which directory.
</li>
<li>
Alter the destination filename - this will be automatically
suggested based on the creation date (for PDFs) or last modification
date (for MS WORD docs), and the longer of its existing filename or
any title specified in its metadata. 
</li>
<li>
Create a bibliography entry (for PDFs only) - this will put a copy
of the document into your library (it will not remove it from the
desktop cleaner).
</li>
<li>
Delete the file if it is no longer necessary.
</li>
<li>
"Go" and file the document as specified.

</li>
</ul>

<p>BUG ALERT: on MS Windows, there is an issue with Pieberry causing MS
WORD documents to be 'locked' and unable to be moved. This is proving
difficult to resolve, but the problem usually goes away after closing
and reopening Pieberry.
</p>
<p>
You can also open the temp directory to get right at these files, or
'process all' which will move all files that have a destination
directory specified.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.4">


<p>
Pieberry - in addition to its bibliography search function - also
contains a simple filename search function, accessible through the
<b>Tools</b> menu or by Ctrl-Shift-F. Like the bibliography search, it
takes a simple syntax of:
</p>
<p>
area==term1;term2
</p>
<p>
You can search the 'library' or 'projects' areas ('l' and 'p') for
short, or 'all', and also search by year or month. 
</p>
<p>
This searches only filenames, not metadata nor document text. A full
text search may be some way off. Files thus found will be displayed,
but the citation functionality is not available.
