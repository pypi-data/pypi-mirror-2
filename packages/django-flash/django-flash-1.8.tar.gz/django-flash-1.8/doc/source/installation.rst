Installation
============

There are several ways to download and install Django-Flash:

**Via PyPI**

  Execute the following command line to download and install the latest
  stable version from CheeseShop_::

      $ easy_install -U django-flash


  Follow `these instructions <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ to
  install SetupTools if you don't have it already.


**Via GitHub**

  If you are a Git_ user and want to take a closer look at the project's
  source code, you would rather clone our
  `public repository <http://github.com/danielfm/django-flash/tree/master>`_
  instead::

      $ git clone git://github.com/danielfm/django-flash.git
      $ cd django-flash
      $ python setup.py install


**Zip file/tarball**

  Django-Flash is also available for download as
  `compressed archives <http://github.com/danielfm/django-flash/downloads>`_
  (either ``zip`` and ``tgz``). After unzip/untar the archive, execute the
  following command to install Django-Flash::
  
      $ python setup.py install


**Manually**

  To add Django-Flash to your project as a bundled library, just add the
  ``djangoflash`` directory into your project along with the other apps.
