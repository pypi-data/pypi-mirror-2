Advanced Python Scheduler (apscheduler) is a light but powerful in-process task
scheduler that lets you schedule functions (or any python callables) to be
executed at times of your choosing.

The development of apscheduler was heavily influenced by the `Quartz
<http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/>`_ task scheduler written in Java,
although APScheduler cannot claim as many features.
