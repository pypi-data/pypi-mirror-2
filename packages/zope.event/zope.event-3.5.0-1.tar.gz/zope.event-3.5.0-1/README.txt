**********

The ``zope.event`` package provides a simple event system.  It provides:

- An event publishing system

- A very simple event-dispatching system on which more sophisticated
  event dispatching systems can be built. For example, a type-based
  event dispatching system that builds on ``zope.event`` can be found in
  ``zope.component``.
