Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A doormat is a large collection of links which are presented in a structured
        way. One example is the current plone.org_, where the div#sitemap at the bottom
        is actually an ordered collection of internal and external links, with sections
        called "Downloads", "Documentation", "Developers", "Plone foundation" and
        "Support". See more examples_ of doormats.
        
        This product adds a couple of content types (Archetypes), which are used to
        create a structure which is used for generating a doormat. A viewlet on this
        doormat is placed in the Plone footer. The links in the Doormat are managed as
        content, making the Doormat more flexible than a sitemap.  It's also possible
        to add external links.
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        After installing the product in your site, you can add a "Doormat" item to your
        Plone site. Inside it, you can create a hierarchical structure of Columns,
        Sections and links (both internal and external). 
        
        The Doormat will look like this, schematically::
        
            +-- Doormat -----------------------------------------+
            |                                                    |
            |  +-- Column 1 ----------+  + Column 2 -----------+ |
            |  |                      |  |                     | |
            |  |  +-- Section 1 ----+ |  | +-- Section 1 ----+ | |
            |  |  |                 | |  | |                 | | |
            |  |  |  +-- Link 1 --+ | |  | |  +-- Link 1 --+ | | |
            |  |  |  +------------+ | |  | |  +------------+ | | |
            |  |  |                 | |  | |                 | | |
            |  |  |  +-- Link 2 --+ | |  | |  +-- Link 2 --+ | | |
            |  |  |  +------------+ | |  | |  +------------+ | | |
            |  |  |                 | |  | |                 | | |
            |  |  +-----------------+ |  | +-----------------+ | |
            |  |                      |  |                     | |
            |  +----------------------+  +---------------------+ |
            |                                                    |
            +----------------------------------------------------+
        
        And in real life: 
        
        .. image:: http://plone.org/products/doormat/screenshot
        
        Note that the product adds an extra hierarchical layer compared to the
        plone.org_ doormat: it adds a Column, which can contain more than one Section.
        An example using this structure is the Oosterpoort_, which actually is the
        product's predecessor.
        
        
        Simple configuration
        ====================
        
        You'll probably want to exclude the doormat object from navigation using the 
        "Settings" tab. (This was not yet done when the above screenshot was taken.)
        
        There's a field `showTitle` on the folderish types (Doormat, Column and
        Section) which allows content managers to decide if the item's title should be
        displayed in the doormat.
        
        
        Moving the doormat
        ==================
        
        By default, the doormat viewlet is placed in the `plone.portalfooter` viewlet
        manager. It's easy to modify this in an add-on product, so the doormat will
        display below the global navigation (portal tabs), or anywhere else in the
        site.
        
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        The viewlet does a catalog lookup for the `Doormat` portal type. If you have
        more than one object of this type (nothing stops you), it will use the oldest
        one.

        ----------------
        
        Initial release
        
        To do
        =====
        
        * Add some sort of caching for getDoormatData and getDoormatTitle methods, or
          for the entire viewlet. Or at least get an idea of how expensive they are.
          Currently the viewlet computes the whole doormat each time it is rendered.
        
        * Correctly set internal / external class on link anchors.
