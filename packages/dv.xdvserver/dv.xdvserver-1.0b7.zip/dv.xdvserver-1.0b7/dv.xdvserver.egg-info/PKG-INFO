Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        dv.xdvserver is a simple piece of WSGI middleware that can execute the two
        step compile-and-run XSLT transforms of xdv.
        
        It takes two required parameters:
        
         - rules: a path to a file containing Deliverance rules
         - theme: a URI or path to a theme HTML file
        
        In addition, it can take several optional parameters:
        
         - absolute_prefix: if given, relative urls in the theme file will be made
            into absolute links with this prefix.
         - notheme: a set of regular expression patterns (or just simple names) that
            will be matched against the incoming path to allow the theme to be
            switched off for some paths. Multiple patterns should be separated by
            newlines.
         - live: set to True to recompile the theme on each request, rather than on
            startup only.
         - compiler: a path to the XSLT file that can turn theme+rules into a compiled
            theme. The default, bundled version will probably suffice in most cases.
         - boilerplate: a path to the XSLT file that contains boilerplate XSLT
            instructions. The default, bundled version will probably suffice in most
            cases.
            
        Configuration
        =============
        
        You can use this middleware in a Paste Deploy pipeline. Here is an example 
        configuration file of an application that themes a Plone site running on
        http://localhost:8080/demo. Static resources are served from /static::
        
            [server:main]
            use = egg:Paste#http
            host = 127.0.0.1
            port = 5000
        
            [composite:main]
            use = egg:Paste#urlmap
            /static = static
            / = default
        
            [app:static]
            use = egg:Paste#static
            document_root = %(here)s/static
        
            [pipeline:default]
            pipeline = egg:Paste#cgitb
                       egg:Paste#httpexceptions
                       theme.default
                       zope.proxy
        
            [filter:theme.default]
            use = egg:dv.xdvserver#xdv
            theme = %(here)s/static/index.html
            rules = %(here)s/static/rules/default.xml
            notheme =
                /emptypage
        
            [app:zope.proxy]
            use = egg:Paste#proxy
            address = http://localhost:8080/VirtualHostBase/http/localhost:5000/demo/VirtualHostRoot/
