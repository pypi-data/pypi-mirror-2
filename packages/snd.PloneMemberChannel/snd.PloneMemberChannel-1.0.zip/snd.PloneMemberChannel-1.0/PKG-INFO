Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is an ugly hack to patch the Singing and Dancing newsletter
        product for Plone.  With this patch all members of your Plone Site are
        automatically subscribed to all newsletters.

        ----------------

        implementation that takes into account plone members. [maurits+vincent]
