Changelog
=========

1.2 (2010-05-12)
----------------

- Fixed problem with handling subscription event that made the
  subscribers search not work as the catalog was not getting updated
  for newly added subscriptions.

1.1 (2010-05-12)
----------------

- Refactored so we no longer need an own PloneMemberSubscriptions
  class and a patch for the Channel, but only a patch for the
  Subscriptions class.  We keep the PloneMemberSubscriptions class for
  backwards compatibility.

1.0 (2010-05-07)
----------------

 - Patched Channel.__init__ so it uses our custom Subscription
   implementation that takes into account plone members. [maurits+vincent]
