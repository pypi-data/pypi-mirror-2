Introduction
============

This is an ugly hack to patch the Singing and Dancing newsletter
product for Plone.  With this patch all members of your Plone Site are
automatically subscribed to all newsletters.

Note that version 1.1 and higher are bit less hacky than 1.0, as from
1.1 onwards we no longer need an own PloneMemberSubscriptions class,
but only a runtime patch.
