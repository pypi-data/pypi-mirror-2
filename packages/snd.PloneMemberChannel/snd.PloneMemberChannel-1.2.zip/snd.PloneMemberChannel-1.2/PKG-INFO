Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is an ugly hack to patch the Singing and Dancing newsletter
        product for Plone.  With this patch all members of your Plone Site are
        automatically subscribed to all newsletters.
        
        Note that version 1.1 and higher are bit less hacky than 1.0, as from
        1.1 onwards we no longer need an own PloneMemberSubscriptions class,
        but only a runtime patch.

        =========
        
        1.2 (2010-05-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed problem with handling subscription event that made the
        subscribers search not work as the catalog was not getting updated
        for newly added subscriptions.

        1.1 (2010-05-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Refactored so we no longer need an own PloneMemberSubscriptions
        class and a patch for the Channel, but only a patch for the
        Subscriptions class.  We keep the PloneMemberSubscriptions class for
        backwards compatibility.

        1.0 (2010-05-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Patched Channel.__init__ so it uses our custom Subscription
        implementation that takes into account plone members. [maurits+vincent]
