Changelog
=========

1.3 (2010-05-14)
----------------

- Added translations.
  [maurits]

- Added patch to add an snd_extra_subscriptions field to Channels and
  hook this up in the edit form.  (Doing this with annotations and an
  interface would have been better, but that did not work.)  Possible
  values are 'All members' and the groups of the Plone Site.
  [maurits]

- Avoid AttributeError when getSite() is None, which can at least
  happen in an instance debug session.

1.2 (2010-05-12)
----------------

- Fixed problem with handling subscription event that made the
  subscribers search not work as the catalog was not getting updated
  for newly added subscriptions.
  [maurits]


1.1 (2010-05-12)
----------------

- Refactored so we no longer need an own PloneMemberSubscriptions
  class and a patch for the Channel, but only a patch for the
  Subscriptions class.  We keep the PloneMemberSubscriptions class for
  backwards compatibility.
  [maurits]


1.0 (2010-05-07)
----------------

 - Patched Channel.__init__ so it uses our custom Subscription
   implementation that takes into account plone members. [maurits+vincent]
