CHANGELOG
=========

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.2 (2010-06-01)

    - Keep the custom registration form reference when RSVPable items are
      copied.  Fixes
      http://plone.org/products/collective.salesforce.rsvp/issues/11.
      Thanks to Steve Allgood.
      [davisagli]

    - Cache the types and fields lookups to Salesforce.  This improves speed at
      the cost of needing to restart Zope if you add/remove fields or types in
      Salesforce.
      [davisagli]

    - Don't include the friendly label for Salesforce object types; it requires
      calling describeSObjects which takes forever to run.
      [davisagli]

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.2b1 (2009-09-08)

    - Updated salesforcebaseconnector query calls to use the new syntax
      where a full SOQL query is specified.  Beatbox 16.0dev or greater
      is now required.
      [davisagli]

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.1 (2009-08-13)

    - Include the form prologue and epilogue in the registration viewlet
      when using a custom PloneFormGen form.
      [davisagli]

    - Make sure the schema extender fields don't show up in base_view.
      [davisagli]

    - Fixed a test to work with v16 of the Salesforce API, which is stricter
      about ID field format.
      [davisagli]

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.0 (2009-01-13)

    - Updated salesforcebaseconnector dependency to v1.0 final.
      [davisagli]

    - Show both the id and label for Salesforce objects and fields.
      [davisagli]

    - Refactored to wrap the form rendering in the capacity check regardless of
      which type of form is being used.
      [davisagli]

    - Take advantage of new embedded forms support in PloneFormGen when rendering a
      custom registration form.  This requires PloneFormGen >= 1.5b2.
      [davisagli]

    - Refactored the registration form viewlet and default registration form to be
      rendered in a much saner fashion.
      [davisagli]

    - Add i18n message ids.
      [davisagli]

    - Make the "limit registration capacity" field actually have an effect rather than
      just controlling display of other form fields.  This helps in the edge case where
      the user clicks this to turn capacity off, but the hidden fields are still selected.
      [davisagli]

    - Make the "enable custom registration form" actually have an effect rather than
      just controlling display of another form field.  This helps workaround the issue
      with not being able to un-reference an item with the ATReferenceBrowserWidget.
      [davisagli]


collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.0a4

    - Fix for kss configuration issue within Plone 3.0.x. See:
      http://plone.org/products/collective.salesforce.rsvp/issues/1 [andrewb]
      
    - provide zcml declarations for all registration-based browser:page templates, this 
      allows for standard customization via layers for others using this product, 
      traverse to browser pages, so that layers are accounted for [andrewb]

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.0a3

    - Fixing kss configuration tests and uninstallation tests, so that we can better claim support 
      for Plone 3.1.x along with 3.0.x [andrewb]
    
    - Package branding changed to 'RSVP for Salesforce' [andrewb, thanks jonstahl]

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.0a2

    - Cleanup of some problematic RST formatting pulled into the long desc on PyPI [andrewb]

collective.salesforce.rsvp - 1.0a1

    - Initial experimental release of RSVP for Salesforce feature allowing for
      Plone content objects to be tied to "registerable" Salesforce.com objects [andrewb]
