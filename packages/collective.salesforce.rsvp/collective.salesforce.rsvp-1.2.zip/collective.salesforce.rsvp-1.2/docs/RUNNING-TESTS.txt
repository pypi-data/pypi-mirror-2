RUNNING TESTS
=============
It is strongly recommended that you run your tests
against a free developer account, rather than a real
production Salesforce.com instance. ... With that said,
to run the tests for Salesforce Auth Plugin do the following:

Configure your Salesforce.com instance:
=======================================
In order to successfully run all of the automated unit tests, 
some modifications need to happen within your Salesforce.com 
instance.

In many of the tests, a dummy campaign within your Salesforce.com
instance is created.  In a few cases, we test the logic for presentation
of the registration/waitlist signup/registration closed options for the
RSVP-enabled content object.  This assumes that the following fields have
been added to the "Campaign" object via Setup --> Customize --> Campaigns 
--> Fields --> "New" button under "Campaign Custom Fields & Relationships"::

 Field Label         Field Name          Field Type    Field Description
 
 -----------         ----------          ----------    -----------------
 
 Allow Waitlists?    Allow_Waitlists     Checkbox      Will you accept waitlist 
                                                       registrations for this campaign?  
                                                       Only required if you plan to enable 
                                                       RSVPs in a capacity limited way 
                                                       via your website.

Note: You can accept the defaults for the other field attributes.
