plonesocial.auth.rpx

        plonesocial.auth.rpx is an addon product for Plone which allows users
        to authenticate via the JanRain's RPX service (http://rpxnow.com). RPX is
        sort of a proxy to let a user authenticate with a lot of identity services such
        as OpenID, Twitter, Facebook and many others.

        Different from the OpenID plugin for Plone the RPX plugin does not just create a virtual 
        user but instead it will map the verfied identifier from RPX (e.g. your OpenID) to an 
        existing or to be created user account. A user is also able to map various identifiers 
        to the same Plone account thus being able to login with his Twitter, Google or Facebook 
        account to the same Plone account. 

        `plonesocial.auth.rpx` also allows the user to manage those mappings.
