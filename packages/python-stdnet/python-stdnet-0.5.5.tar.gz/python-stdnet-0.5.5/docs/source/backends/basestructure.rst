Remote Structure
==============================


Data structures are fundamental constructs around which you build your application.
They are used in almost all computer programs, therefore becoming fluent in what the standard
data-structures can do for you is essential to get full value out of them.
The `standard template library`_ in C++ implements a wide array of structures,
python has several of them too. ``stdnet`` implements **five** remote structures,
all derived from :class:`stdnet.Structure`.
