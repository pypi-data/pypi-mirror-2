Description: ====================
        Django Model Filters
        ====================
        
        The ``model_filters`` app provides you with automatically generated, stylable
        generic Django templates. It fills a gap left by ``admin`` and ``databrowse`` by
        providing filters that allow your to painlessly create templates with the
        following properties:
        
        * Automatically generated read-only views
        * Can conform to whatever URL structure you want
        * Can be placed as blocks on to your existing templates
        * Integrate well with the rest of your project
        
        Add this to the top of any template::
        
            {% load model_filters %}
        
        And drop the filter anywhere you have a model instance (e.g., DetailViews)::
        
            {{ object|as_detail_html }}
        
        Quick Reference
        ---------------
        
        Installing
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can install the ``model_filters`` app from PyPI::
        
            $ pip install django-model-filters
        
        Settings
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Modify your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting to include::
        
            ...
            model_filters,
            ...
        
        If you plan on overriding any of ``model_filter``'s default templates, remember
        that ``app_directories.Loader`` searches apps in the order they are specified
        in ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        Near the top of any template you want to use model filters, or in a base 
        template, include the following line::
        
            {% load model_filters %}
        
        Then, where you want to drop a generic model template, use::
        
            {{ object|as_detail_html }}
        
        Or::
        
            {{ object_list|as_list_html }}
        
        By default, the title on an object detail block will be the unicode
        representation of the object, and the title on a list will be the name of the
        model appended with `' List'`. To change the title, pass in a parameter::
        
            {{ object|as_detail_html:"My Special Object" }}

        Running Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Even simple packages need tests::
        
            $ python tests.py --with-coverage --cover-package=model_filters
        
        Run it before and after you make any changes.  Try to not let that number drop.
