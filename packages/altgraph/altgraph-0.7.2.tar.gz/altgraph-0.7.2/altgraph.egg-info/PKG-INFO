Description: 
        altgraph is a fork of graphlib: a graph (network) package for constructing
        graphs, BFS and DFS traversals, topological sort, shortest paths, etc. with
        graphviz output.
        
        altgraph includes some additional usage of Python 2.3+ features and
        enhancements related to modulegraph and macholib.

        0.7.1
        -----
        
        This is a minor feature release
        
        Features:
        
        - Documentation is now generated using `sphinx <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx>`_
          and can be viewed at <http://packages.python.org/altgraph>.
        
        - The repository has moved to bitbucket 
        
        - ``altgraph.GraphStat.avg_hops`` is no longer present, the function had no
          implementation and no specified behaviour.
        
        - the module ``altgraph.compat`` is gone, which means altgraph will no
          longer work with Python 2.3.
