Changelog of lizard-ui
======================


1.4.1 (2010-06-25)
------------------

- Updated TODO list.


1.4 (2010-06-25)
----------------

- We're now on the python package index, hurray!
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui

- Updated package metadata.

- Big README documentation update.


1.3 (2010-06-23)
----------------

- Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.

- UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in
  corner cases, for instance).


1.2 (2010-06-22)
----------------

- Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with
  javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.

- The main body has "overflow: hidden" to get rid of scrollbars once and for
  all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A
  scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have
  an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is
  perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual
  content).


1.1 (2010-06-18)
----------------

- IE tweaks.


1.0 (2010-06-17)
----------------

- Fixed javascript code with jslint.

- Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.
  You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your
  settings and add "compressor" to your installed apps.

- Switched to a separate "javascript" and "css" block instead of the
  site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when
  you override the blocks.


0.12 (2010-06-11)
-----------------

- Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).

- Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'
  implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our
  existing sidebar css.


0.11 (2010-06-08)
-----------------

- Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base
  treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.


0.10 (2010-06-07)
-----------------

- Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().

- Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.


0.9 (2010-06-03)
----------------

- Using jquery's live() for "late binding" of events to elements added later
  through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.


0.8 (2010-06-01)
----------------

- Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.


0.7 (2010-05-18)
----------------

- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.

- Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed
  div at the bottom.

- Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.


0.6 (2010-04-28)
----------------

- Added collapsible sidebar.

- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The
  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up
  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so
  switching back to blueprint is now possible.

- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.


0.5 (2010-04-13)
----------------

- Layout improvements.

- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).

- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.

- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't
  included automatically anymore.

- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.


0.4 (2010-03-16)
----------------

- Added extjs javascript library.

- Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.


0.3.1 (2010-03-05)
------------------

- Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.


0.3 (2010-03-05)
----------------

- Added openlayers 2.8.

- Added famfamfam silk icon set.

- Added background to menubar, footer and body.

- Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.


0.2 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in
  templates.  We're well-behaved now!


0.1 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.

- Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript
  resources.

- Added blueprint css framework.

- Initial structure created by nensskel.
