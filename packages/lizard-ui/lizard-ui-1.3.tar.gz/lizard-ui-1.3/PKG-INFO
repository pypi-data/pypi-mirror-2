Description: lizard-ui
        ==========================================
        
        Introduction
        
        Usage, etc.
        
        More details in src/lizard_ui/USAGE.txt .
        
        
        Development installation
        ------------------------
        
        The first time, you'll have to run the "bootstrap" script to set up setuptools
        and buildout::
        
            $> python bootstrap.py
        
        And then run buildout to set everything up::
        
            $> bin/buildout
        
        (On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).
        
        You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in
        ``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        The current package is installed as a "development package", so
        changes in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python
        setup.py develop``).
        
        If you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released
        versions), add them as an "svn external" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory
        and add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.
        
        Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.
        
        
        Usage of lizard-ui
        =============================================
        
        
        Usage:
        
            >>> import lizard_ui
        
        Show how to import the main classes and how to use them.

        ====
        
        - Document how to use this UI.
        
        - Strip out some/most of the applications in the testsettings.py as they're
          not really needed.
        
        - Add basic test that the example.html renders without errors.
        
        - Add mechanism for rendering a passed-in (or registered/configured) list of
          object_tabs and object_actions, including some nice formatting.
        
        - Add jquery and extjs javascript libraries.
        
        - Beautify the UI.

        Changelog of lizard-ui
        ======================
        
        
        1.3 (2010-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.
        
        - UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in
          corner cases, for instance).
        
        
        1.2 (2010-06-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with
          javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.
        
        - The main body has "overflow: hidden" to get rid of scrollbars once and for
          all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A
          scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have
          an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is
          perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual
          content).
        
        
        1.1 (2010-06-18)
        ----------------
        
        - IE tweaks.
        
        
        1.0 (2010-06-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed javascript code with jslint.
        
        - Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.
          You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your
          settings and add "compressor" to your installed apps.
        
        - Switched to a separate "javascript" and "css" block instead of the
          site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when
          you override the blocks.
        
        
        0.12 (2010-06-11)
        -----------------
        
        - Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).
        
        - Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'
          implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our
          existing sidebar css.
        
        
        0.11 (2010-06-08)
        -----------------
        
        - Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base
          treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.
        
        
        0.10 (2010-06-07)
        -----------------
        
        - Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().
        
        - Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.
        
        
        0.9 (2010-06-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Using jquery's live() for "late binding" of events to elements added later
          through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.
        
        
        0.8 (2010-06-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.
        
        
        0.7 (2010-05-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.
        
        - Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed
          div at the bottom.
        
        - Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.
        
        
        0.6 (2010-04-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Added collapsible sidebar.
        
        - Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The
          reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up
          the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so
          switching back to blueprint is now possible.
        
        - Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-04-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Layout improvements.
        
        - Added documentation (just mount our urls!).
        
        - Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.
        
        - Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't
          included automatically anymore.
        
        - Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-03-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Added extjs javascript library.
        
        - Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2010-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.
        
        
        0.3 (2010-03-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Added openlayers 2.8.
        
        - Added famfamfam silk icon set.
        
        - Added background to menubar, footer and body.
        
        - Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.
        
        
        0.2 (2010-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in
          templates.  We're well-behaved now!
        
        
        0.1 (2010-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.
        
        - Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript
          resources.
        
        - Added blueprint css framework.
        
        - Initial structure created by nensskel.
