Description: lizard-ui
        =========
        
        Lizard-ui provides a basic `Django <http://djangoproject.com>`_ user
        interface, so a **base Django template** and some **css + javascript**.  We
        designed it at `Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for our
        geographical information websites (with water management information).
        
        
        Choices, requirements, assumptions
        ----------------------------------
        
        Lizard-ui is opinionated: it makes choices and prescribes (good!)
        technologies.
        
        - Included: the `blueprint css framework <http://www.blueprintcss.org/>`_.  It
          resets css styles so that we've got a common base.  It fixes common IE
          layout bugs.  It gives a basic typography that's quite pleasing.
        
        - Required: `django-staticfiles
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-staticfiles>`_.  For a more verbose
          description, see `Reinout's blog entry
          <http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2010/05/19/django-css-javascript-files.html>`_
          (written with lizard-ui in mind).
        
        - Required: `django_compressor
          <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_compressor>`_ for combining css/javascript
          files in production.
        
        - Assumption: one screen, using the full width/height of the browser, without
          scrolling.  Our main goal is showing a nice big map with a small header and
          a sidebar.  You don't want to scroll a map.  It is of course possible to
          have a scrollbar inside that main content area itself.
        
        - Assumption: javascript is available.  Hey, we're showing a map so you need
          javascript.  So we liberally use javascript to get the UI right, for
          instance by detecting and setting the main content area's width and height.
        
        - Included: jquery.  Yeah, it is pretty much the standard nowadays.  So we use
          jquery where jquery can be used instead of doing it with generic javascript.
        
        - Included: both jqueryui and jquerytools.  Visual goodies.  Jquerytools for
          the overlay and tabs, jqueryui for the rest (drag/drop and so).
        
        - Included: openlayers as map javascript library.  (Lizard-map, sooooon to be
          released, contains our basic map interaction javascript and python code).

        Django settings
        ---------------
        
        Here's an excerpt of a ``settings.py`` you can use.  The media and static root
        directory setup assumes the use of buildout, but you can translate it to your
        own filesystem setup::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS = [
              'lizard_ui',
              'compressor',
              'staticfiles',
              'django.contrib.admin',
              'django.contrib.auth',
              'django.contrib.contenttypes',
              'django.contrib.sessions',
              'django.contrib.sites',
              ]
        
          # Note: the below settings are more elaborate than needed,
          # but we want to test django_compressor's compressing which
          # needs a media url and root and so.
        
          # Set COMPRESS to True if you want to test compression when
          # DEBUG == True.  (By default, COMPRESS is the opposite of
          # DEBUG).
          COMPRESS = False
        
          # SETTINGS_DIR allows media paths and so to be relative to
          # this settings file instead of hardcoded to
          # c:\only\on\my\computer.
          SETTINGS_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
        
          # BUILDOUT_DIR is for access to the "surrounding" buildout,
          # for instance for BUILDOUT_DIR/var/static files to give
          # django-staticfiles a proper place to place all collected
          # static files.
          BUILDOUT_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(SETTINGS_DIR, '..'))
        
          # Absolute path to the directory that holds user-uploaded
          # media.
          MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'media')
          # Absolute path to the directory where django-staticfiles'
          # "bin/django build_static" places all collected static
          # files from all applications' /media directory.
          STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'static')
        
          # URL that handles the media served from MEDIA_ROOT. Make
          # sure to use a trailing slash if there is a path component
          # (optional in other cases).
          MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
          # URL for the per-application /media static files collected
          # by django-staticfiles.  Use it in templates like "{{
          # MEDIA_URL }}mypackage/my.css".
          STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'
          # URL prefix for admin media -- CSS, JavaScript and
          # images. Make sure to use a trailing slash.  Uses
          # STATIC_URL as django-staticfiles nicely collects admin's
          # static media into STATIC_ROOT/admin.
          ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = STATIC_URL + 'admin/'
        
          # Storage engine to be used during compression
          COMPRESS_STORAGE = "staticfiles.storage.StaticFileStorage"
          # The URL that linked media will be read from and compressed
          # media will be written to.
          COMPRESS_URL = STATIC_URL
          # The absolute file path that linked media will be read from
          # and compressed media will be written to.
          COMPRESS_ROOT = STATIC_ROOT
        
        
          # Used for django-staticfiles
          TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
              # Default items.
              "django.core.context_processors.auth",
              "django.core.context_processors.debug",
              "django.core.context_processors.i18n",
              "django.core.context_processors.media",
              # Needs to be added for django-staticfiles to allow you
              # to use {{ STATIC_URL }}myapp/my.css in your templates.
              'staticfiles.context_processors.static_url',
              )
        
        And a suitable apache config hint::
        
          <Location /static_media/>
            # The css/javascript/image staticfiles are cached in the
            # browser for a day.
            ExpiresActive On
            ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 day"
          </Location>
        
          <Location /static_media/CACHE/>
            # django_compress's generated timestamp'ed files:
            # cache forever
            ExpiresActive On
            ExpiresDefault "access plus 10 years"
          </Location>
        
          # Static files are hosted by apache itself.
          # User-uploaded media: MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
          Alias /media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/media/
          # django-staticfiles: STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'
          Alias /static_media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/static/
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can mount lizard-ui's urls, but it contains only live examples.  So
        perhaps you should only mount it in debug mode under ``/ui``.  Handy, as it
        contains reasonably full documentation on how to use it, including available
        blocks and classes/IDs that you can use.
        
        The base layout is defined in ``realbase.html``.  You should however extend
        ``lizard_ui/lizardbase.html`` and then override the blocks that you want.
        
        CSS and javascript should be added to the relevant blocks, but don't forget to
        call "block.super".  An example::
        
          {% extends "lizard_ui/lizardbase.html" %}
        
          {% block css %}
          {{ block.super }}
          <link type="text/css"
                href="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.css"
                media="screen, projection"
                rel="stylesheet" />
          {% endblock css %}
        
          {% block javascript %}
          {{ block.super }}
          <script type="text/javascript"
                  src="{{ STATIC_URL }}openlayers/OpenLayers.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript"
                  src="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/jquery.workspace.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript"
                  src="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.js"></script>
          {% endblock javascript %}
        
          {% block content %}
          <div id="map"></div>
          {% endblock content %}
        
        A example of a common task: change the logo.  For that, make a
        ``media/lizard_ui`` directory in your django application (or site) and place a
        ``logo.png`` in it.  Django-staticfiles' mechanism will take your logo.png in
        preference to lizard-ui's.
        
        
        Development installation
        ------------------------
        
        The first time, you'll have to run the "bootstrap" script to set up setuptools
        and buildout::
        
            $> python bootstrap.py
        
        And then run buildout to set everything up::
        
            $> bin/buildout
        
        (On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).
        
        You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in
        ``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        The current package is installed as a "development package", so
        changes in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python
        setup.py develop``).
        
        If you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released
        versions), add them as an "svn external" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory
        and add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.
        
        Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Document all of the available classes/IDs that you can use to get automatic
          (javascript) behaviour.
        
        - Document the javascript code.
        
        - Add basic test that the example.html renders without errors.
        
        - Add javascript tests for the javascript code, ideally.
        
        - Add mechanism for rendering a passed-in (or registered/configured) list of
          object_tabs and object_actions, including some nice formatting.
        
        - Add mechanism for breadcrumbs.
        
        - Important: add tests for the login functionality.

        - Bugfix simplejson.
        
        
        1.12 (2010-08-27)
        -----------------
        
        - Small adjustments to support lizard-map's new graph popup.  (A better
          separation of lizard-ui and lizard-map is needed later on: after the
          deadlines :-) ).
        
        
        1.11 (2010-08-26)
        -----------------
        
        - Styled the login form including proper "enter" behaviour and
          first-field-gets-focus handling.
        
        
        1.10 (2010-08-26)
        -----------------
        
        - Moved some css styling from lizard-map to lizard-ui.
        
        - Added initial login support + forms.  You need to add lizard-ui's urls.py to
          yours if you want to use it.
        
        - Better drag/drop visual feedback.
        
        
        1.8 (2010-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Javascript syntax fix: added two semicolons and removed another.
        
        
        1.7 (2010-07-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Make "replace-with-image" clickable by using "data-href-click"
          property.
        
        - Add ol.forms css.
        
        
        1.6 (2010-07-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Image replacement looks at "use-my-size" class instead of
          use-my-width/height.
        
        - Added javascript "printPage()" function that prints a webpage that at least
          doesn't flow over the right hand side of the physical paper page.  Printing
          uses a combination of a custom print stylesheet and blueprint's print
          stylesheet.  Printing definitively isn't perfect yet, but at least usable.
          Note: you should refresh or resize the page after printing to get the full
          width again.
        
        
        1.5 (2010-07-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Added generic automatic image resizing (replacing a generic "a href" with an
          image with the same src as the href and then figuring out the height/width
          and passing that along as a GET parameter and as attributes on the img tag.
        
        - Fixed resize timer by having a global variable for it.
        
        - Calculating hiddenStuffHeight (currently: only the date popup hidden div)
          only once: before the date popup has been opened..  Fixes the bug that you'd
          get a large empty space at the bottom of the screen.
        
        
        1.4.1 (2010-06-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated TODO list.
        
        
        1.4 (2010-06-25)
        ----------------
        
        - We're now on the python package index, hurray!
          http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui
        
        - Updated package metadata.
        
        - Big README documentation update.
        
        
        1.3 (2010-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.
        
        - UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in
          corner cases, for instance).
        
        
        1.2 (2010-06-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with
          javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.
        
        - The main body has "overflow: hidden" to get rid of scrollbars once and for
          all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A
          scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have
          an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is
          perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual
          content).
        
        
        1.1 (2010-06-18)
        ----------------
        
        - IE tweaks.
        
        
        1.0 (2010-06-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed javascript code with jslint.
        
        - Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.
          You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your
          settings and add "compressor" to your installed apps.
        
        - Switched to a separate "javascript" and "css" block instead of the
          site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when
          you override the blocks.
        
        
        0.12 (2010-06-11)
        -----------------
        
        - Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).
        
        - Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'
          implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our
          existing sidebar css.
        
        
        0.11 (2010-06-08)
        -----------------
        
        - Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base
          treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.
        
        
        0.10 (2010-06-07)
        -----------------
        
        - Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().
        
        - Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.
        
        
        0.9 (2010-06-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Using jquery's live() for "late binding" of events to elements added later
          through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.
        
        
        0.8 (2010-06-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.
        
        
        0.7 (2010-05-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.
        
        - Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed
          div at the bottom.
        
        - Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.
        
        
        0.6 (2010-04-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Added collapsible sidebar.
        
        - Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The
          reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up
          the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so
          switching back to blueprint is now possible.
        
        - Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-04-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Layout improvements.
        
        - Added documentation (just mount our urls!).
        
        - Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.
        
        - Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't
          included automatically anymore.
        
        - Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-03-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Added extjs javascript library.
        
        - Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2010-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.
        
        
        0.3 (2010-03-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Added openlayers 2.8.
        
        - Added famfamfam silk icon set.
        
        - Added background to menubar, footer and body.
        
        - Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.
        
        
        0.2 (2010-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in
          templates.  We're well-behaved now!
        
        
        0.1 (2010-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.
        
        - Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript
          resources.
        
        - Added blueprint css framework.
        
        - Initial structure created by nensskel.
