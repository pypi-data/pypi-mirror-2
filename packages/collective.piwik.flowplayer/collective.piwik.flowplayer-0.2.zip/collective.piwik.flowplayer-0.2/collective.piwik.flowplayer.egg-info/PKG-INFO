Description: Introduction
        ============
        collective.piwik.flowplayer displays a video play counter for Plone sites that use flowplayer.
        
        The Piwik open source analytics system (http://piwik.org/) is used to store the usage data.
        
        Works both with and without collective.transcode.star
        
        How to get it working
        =====================
        
        - You need to have access to a working Piwik installation. Create a new site in the Piwik admin UI and provide the view permission to anonymous users.
        
        - Add the Piwik Tracking Tag to Javascript web stats support field at <SITEURL>/@@site-controlpanel
        
        - You need to make a small change at the tracking tag adding the line "var site_id = X;", replacing X with your Piwik site_id
        For example, if in the Piwik code you have:
        var piwikTracker = Piwik.getTracker(pkBaseURL + "piwik.php", 6);
        then site_id = 6 in your case
        
        
        If you do the above a viewlet should appear on top of flowplayer displaying the number of views of each video.
        
        Tweaks
        ======
        
        The number of a video views shown is increased when a user presses play on a video. If you want to change this
        behavior, edit collective/piwik/flowplayer/viewlet.pt (change onStart for example).
