Description: Introduction
        ============
        collective.piwik.flowplayer displays a video play counter for Plone sites that use `collective.flowplayer <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer>`_.
        A download counter is displayed when used in combination with `collective.transcode.star <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transcode.star>`_ or `Plumi <http://plumi.org>`_.
        
        The `Piwik <http://piwik.org/>`_  open source analytics system is used to store and retrieve the usage data.
        
        How to get it working
        =====================
        
        - Install collective.piwik.core and collective.flowplayer from the Plone control panel.
        - You need to have access to a working Piwik installation. Create a new site in the Piwik admin UI and a new user who should have view access for that site.
        - Go to the Piwik Settings page in the Plone control panel and enter the URL of your Piwik instance, the siteId and the user's authentication token
        - Upload an flv/mp4 video that can be played by flowplayer and click play
        
        If you do the above a viewlet should appear on top of flowplayer displaying the number of views of each video.
