This module was created to provide a simple way of emailing information
and alerts to email accounts using the already provided smtplib module. 

If you take this code and make improvments, please let me know 
(yb@aliendev.com) so I can make the adjustments to this module. Thank
you.

This module is tested using python3.

example usage:
    sendEmail('test@mail.com', 'computer@mail.com', 'This is a test email', 
                'This message was sent using AlienDevs ybEmail Module')
