This module was created to provide a simple way of emailing information
and alerts to email accounts using the already provided smtplib module.
Future updates will include attachemnts, multiple email receipients, 
and much much more. 


If you take this code and make improvments, please let me know 
(yb@aliendev.com) so I can make the adjustments to this module. Thank
you.
