Changes
-------

1.3.4 (2011-06-22)
------------------
 - Fixed the setup.py and httplib2 import error during installing.
 - Reordered the options variables in an options.py file.
   Allows index.query() to be called with or without a key
 - Fixed issue #15 regarding dependency to httplib2
 - Patched index.query() so it can take a query without a key (to support, say,
   mutli-field Lucene queries). Ultimately, query so probably be refactored to
   Index (instead of IndexKey) because IndexKey doesn't actually help with
   full-text queries.
 - Fixed for issue #19 (missed that urllib.quote).
 - Altered the test_query_index case to reflect how I think indexing should
   work.
 - Using assertTrue instead of failUnless in tests.py, failUnless is deprecated
   in 2.7 and up, so I figured we might as well switch.
 - Added SMART_ERRORS (aka "Django mode"). If you set SMART_ERROR to True it
   will make the client throw KeyError instead of NotFoundError when a key is
   missing.


1.3.3 (2011-06-14)
------------------
 - Fixed an introspection when the results list of a traverse is empty.
 - Merge pull request #17 from mhluongo/master
 - Resolved the STOP_AT_END_OF_GRAPH traversal test case.
   Calling .traverse(stop=STOP_AT_END_OF_GRAPH) will now traverse the graph
   without a max depth (and without 500 errors).
 - Added a failing test case for traverse(stop=STOP_AT_END_OF_GRAPH).


1.3.2 (2011-05-30)
------------------
 - Added a test for deleting relationships.
 - Fixing an Index compatibility issue with Python 2.6.1.
 - Fixing an error in extensions support with named params.


1.3.1 (2011-04-16)
------------------
 - Fixing setup.py.


1.3.0 (2011-04-15)
------------------
 - First Python Index Package release with full support for Neo4j 1.3.
