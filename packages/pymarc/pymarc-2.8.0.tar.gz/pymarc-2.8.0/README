DESCRIPTION
-----------

pymarc is a python library for working with MARC21 bibliographic data
loosely based on the MARC/Perl suite of modules (http://marcpm.sf.net).

INSTALLATION
------------

You'll probably just want to use easy_install to install pymarc:

    easy_install pymarc

If you'd like to download and install the latest source you'll need git:

    git clone git://github.com/edsu/pymarc.git

Run the pymarc test suite to make sure things are in order with the 
distribution:

    python test.py

And then install:

    python setup.py install

For typical usage of this library look at the documentation in 
pymarc/__init__.py or at the unittests found in the test directory.
