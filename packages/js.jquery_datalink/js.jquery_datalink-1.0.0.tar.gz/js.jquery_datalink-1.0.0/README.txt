js.jquery_datalink
******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery Datalink`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery Datalink`: https://github.com/nje/jquery-datalink

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_datalink``) are published to some URL.
