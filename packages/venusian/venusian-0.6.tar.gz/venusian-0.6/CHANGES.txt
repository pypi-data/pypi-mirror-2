Change Log
==========

0.6 (2011-01-09)
----------------

- Some metaclasses (Elixir's) don't raise an AttributeError when asked for a
  nonexistent attribute during a scan.  We now catch all exceptions when
  interrogating an object for ``__venusian_callbacks__`` rather than just
  AttributeError.

0.5 (2010-12-19)
----------------

- Make ``codeinfo`` attribute available as an attribute of the AttachInfo
  object. It will be a tuple in the form ``(filename, lineno, function,
  sourceline)`` representing the context of the venusian decorator.  Eg.
  ``('/home/chrism/projects/venusian/tests/test_advice.py', 81,
  'testCallInfo', 'add_handler(foo, bar)')``

0.4 (2010-09-03)
----------------

- Bug fix: when a venusian decorator used as a class decorator was
  used against both a class *and* a subclass of that class, the
  superclass and subclass would effectively share the same set of
  callbacks.  This was not the intent: each class declaration should
  have its own local set of callbacks; callbacks added via decorations
  should not be inherited, and a superclass should not receive its
  subclass' decorations.

- Arrange test fixtures into a single directory.

0.3 (2010-06-24)
----------------

- Ignore orphaned modules (``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files without a
  corresponding ``.py`` file) during a scan.

0.2 (2010-04-18)
----------------

- Add the concept of scan categories (see the "Scan Categories"
  section of the documentation) to allow an application to make use of
  more than one Venusian-using framework simultaneously.

0.1 (2010-02-15)
----------------

- Initial release.
