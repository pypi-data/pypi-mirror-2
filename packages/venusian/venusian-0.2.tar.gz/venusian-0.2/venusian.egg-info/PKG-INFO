Description: venusian
        ========
        
        Venusian is a library which allows framework authors to defer
        decorator actions.  Instead of taking actions when a function (or
        class) decorator is executed at import time, you can defer the action
        usually taken by the decorator until a separate "scan" phase.
        
        See the "docs" directory of the package or the online documentation at
        `http://docs.repoze.org/venusian <http://docs.repoze.org/venusian>`_.

        - Add the concept of scan categories (see the "Scan Categories"

        more than one Venusian-using framework simultaneously.
