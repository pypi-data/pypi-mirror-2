Changelog

Version 1.9.7:
-Client support for python2.7. (NOTE: server does not fully support py2.7. It will by Aug 1, 2010)
-Support pickling of stdout/stdin  

Version 1.9.6:
-Fixed up some memory leaks and bugs with installer
-cloud will work even if ~/.picloud directory cannot be created

Version 1.9.5:
-Added cloud.files -- An API to store data on the cloud
-Significant improvements in overall network protocol. Is now much more reliable
-Fixed various bugs in simulator

Version 1.9:
-Significant modifications to data serialization handling reduce memory usage and serialization time
-Modifications to map protocol to allow jobs to start being processed before cloud.map() returns
-_fast_serialization option to speed up argument and result serialization

Version 1.8.3:
-Pickle numpy ufunc
-Simulation and cloud.mp (but not yet the cloud server) detects if sys.exit() is called in a running job.
	Remember: You should NEVER call sys.exit() within a running job
-_restartable option is true by default

Version 1.8.2:
-_profile option is false by default
-Bug fixes in dependency analyzer

Version 1.8.1:
-Moved cloud.conf on windows to %APPDATA%
-Added cloud.getconfigpath() to see where configuration file is stored
-Added _profile option to disable profiling
-Transmit module version information with cloud.call/cloud.map

Version 1.8:
-Deal with UNICODE labels, functions, and directories more sanely (see documentation)
-Don't fail to deserialize pickles if requested modules cannot load
-Added cloud.__version__
-More bugs fixed

Version 1.7:

-Improved caching system, resulting in lower memory usage.
-cloud.map() now returns an xrange describing jids rather than a list
-cloud.status/result/etc accept an xrange of jids and make use of 'piece-wise' xrange objects for more efficient memory and network usage
-Added cloud.iresult() to iterate through results: See documentation.
-drastically sped up cloud.join/cloud.result in simulation and cloud.mp
