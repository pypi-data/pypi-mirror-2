--Correct connection bugs when in SSL mode
-Added support for variables to be listed in a class' __transient__ attribute.
--Transient variables are not serialized
--See documentation @  
-Changed join policy to error as soon as any error is detected.

Version 2.1.5:
-Fixed ignore_errors being incorrectly camelCased as ignoreErrors

Version 2.1.4:
-PiCloud shows traceback when viewing a killed job. 
-Added support for ignore_errors to join, result, and iresult
-fix bug where iresult could deadlock

Version 2.1.3:

-Added ability to manage realtime units with cloud.account
-Correct types for cloud.account return values
-Fixed support for python < 2.5.2
-Improved setup process for windows users.

Version 2.1.2:
-Fix bug with HTTP handling that could cause duplicate requests to be sent.
-Additional debugging information
-Do not cache runtime cloud.info requests

Version 2.1.1:

function from being run again.

Version 2.1.0:
-Persistent HTTP(S) connection - significant network traffic improvement
-Can view exception information as text with cloud.info
-cloud.connection_info() will show HTTPS if connected securely
-better debug statements for network traffic

Version 2.0.0:
-Added cloud.cron to leverage cron support
-cloud.kill() can now be used with no arguments to kill every running and queued job.
-Add support for passing function kwargs into cloud.call (e.g. cloud.call(foo, a=3) to run foo(a=3)
-Additional bug fixes

Version 1.9.8:
-Fixed up issue with large numbers of map jobs occasionally timing out.

Version 1.9.7:
-Client support for python2.7. (NOTE: server does not fully support py2.7. It will by Aug 1, 2010)
-Support pickling of stdout/stdin  

Version 1.9.6:
-Fixed up some memory leaks and bugs with installer
-cloud will work even if ~/.picloud directory cannot be created

Version 1.9.5:
-Added cloud.files -- An API to store data on the cloud
-Significant improvements in overall network protocol. Is now much more reliable
-Fixed various bugs in simulator

Version 1.9:
-Significant modifications to data serialization handling reduce memory usage and serialization time
-Modifications to map protocol to allow jobs to start being processed before cloud.map() returns
-_fast_serialization option to speed up argument and result serialization

Version 1.8.3:
-Pickle numpy ufunc
-Simulation and cloud.mp (but not yet the cloud server) detects if sys.exit() is called in a running job.
	Remember: You should NEVER call sys.exit() within a running job
-_restartable option is true by default

Version 1.8.2:
-_profile option is false by default
-Bug fixes in dependency analyzer

Version 1.8.1:
-Moved cloud.conf on windows to %APPDATA%
-Added cloud.getconfigpath() to see where configuration file is stored
-Added _profile option to disable profiling
-Transmit module version information with cloud.call/cloud.map
-Various bug fixes

Version 1.8:
-Deal with UNICODE labels, functions, and directories more sanely (see documentation)
-Don't fail to deserialize pickles if requested modules cannot load
-Added cloud.__version__
-More bugs fixed

Version 1.7:
-Reduce number of empty datalog directories created
-Added _high_cpu keyword argument
-various bug fixes

Version 1.6:
-Added cloud.accounts to provision API keys via python
-Added cloud.pool which emulator multiprocessing.pool interface
-Cloud client now open-sourced under LGPL license
-Various bugs fixed with serialization logging
-functools.partial can now be serialized

version 1.5:
-cloud/cloud.mp interoperability works correctly now.
-Fixed bug where serialization logs were not saved
-Greatly sped up dependency analysis
-Corrected bugs with dependency analysis
-Added ability to pickle read-only files and PIL Images
-Added ability to transport and analyze Python Egg/Zips
-Improved caching system, resulting in lower memory usage.
-cloud.map() now returns an xrange describing jids rather than a list
-cloud.status/result/etc accept an xrange of jids and make use of 'piece-wise' xrange objects for more efficient memory and network usage
-Added cloud.iresult() to iterate through results: See documentation.
-drastically sped up cloud.join/cloud.result in simulation and cloud.mp
 
Version 1.0:
-Initial release
