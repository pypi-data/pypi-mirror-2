restful is a python library to help people write RESTful services

                                                 -- Master Of Obvious

Everytime I write a system, I have the need for writing a CRUD
system. Sometimes I don't do it my self, but I use an already existing
one, like Django. Almost everytime, it's not enough. In almost all
cases, I need a higher customization level, that unfortunately, these
frameworks will not give me.

One of the main reasons to say that these frameworks are not enough is
that I like (and sometimes need) to use a lot of javascript to create
more interesting javascript interfaces. So, it makes the html code
produced by the CRUD framework hard to change.

This way, I though that a good option could be creating a javascript
interface to directly handle things that, usually, I'd need a customized
server-side controller.

This library tries to be a comfortable and generic controller for all
these common actions. Allowing the programmer to use it directly from
javascript.

I'll keep updating this file, I promise!
