        ============
        
        ``mobi.devices`` is the set of tools to detect mobile user agents.
        It uses `WURFL database <http://wurfl.sourceforce.net>`_ as well as data from
        `MIT mobile project <http://m.mit.edu>`_.
        
        It also provides wsgi middlewares that can tag the request with some information
        about the devices performing the request.
        
        Run the tests ::
        
            python setup.py nosetests
