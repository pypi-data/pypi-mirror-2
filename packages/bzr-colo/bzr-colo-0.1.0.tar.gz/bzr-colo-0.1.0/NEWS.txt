bzr-colo Release Notes
######################

bzr-colo 0.1.0
##############

This release should be feature complete, adding the ability to synchronize 
to and from colocated workspaces and pulling from all remote branches 
named "origin/..."  This version also introduces a requirement on Bazaar
versions later than 2.1.

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* The colo-fetch command now creates the initial branch with the name
  origin/trunk to facilitate use with the new colo-pull command.

* If no second argument is given, colo-fetch creates the workspace with
  a name derived from the fetched location (similar to Bazaar's branch
  command). (#538942)

Improvements
------------

* Add colo-sync-to and colo-sync-from commands to synchronize every branch
  in a colocated workspace with a different workspace.

* Add a ``--no-tree`` option to colo-init that creates a colocated workspace
  without a working tree.  This allows creating colocated workspaces over
  remote transports that don't allow creating working trees.

* Add a colo-pull command that pulls all branches whose names begin with
  "origin/".

* Add a colo-mv command for renaming colocated branches.

* Add a ``--trunk-name`` option to colo-init to specify the name of the 
  initial branch.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Bump the minimum require Bazaar version to 2.1 since we use
  BzrCommand.run_direct. (#550033)

* Declare the minimum Bazaar version in the code.  Avoid breaking the test
  suite on 2.0. (Martin Pool, Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* Don't delete promiscuously in .bzr/branches.  Require the arguments of
  colo-prune to be the names of branches. (#529760)

* Give better error messages with qbzr import errors.
  (#520485, Alexander Belchenko)

bzr-colo 0.0.2
##############

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* The colo-clone command was renamed colo-checkout, with a short alias of
  colo-co.  The --create option is now available as -b.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* colo-prune now has an alias of colo-delete.  qprune has a similar alias of
  qdelete.

Improvements
------------

* Define two graphical commands for dealing with colocated branches.
  ``qbranches`` lists the existing colocated branches and ``qprune`` allows
  for deleting colocated branches

* Add support for Bazaar Explorer toolsets for dealing with colocated
  branches.

* Support hierarchical branch names such as "bugs/1234" with a separator of
  "/".  These branches are stored in subdirectories of .bzr/branches.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Add a colo-fixup command for the situation where colocated workspaces have
  been moved on disk.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Improve lazy loading.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* List aliases inside each command.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Improve the error message when using colo: outside of a colocated workspace.
  (#517522, Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* Document the dependency on recent versions of bzr and qbzr.
