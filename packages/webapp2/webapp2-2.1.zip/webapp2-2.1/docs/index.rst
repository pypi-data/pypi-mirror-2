   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to webapp2!
===================
`webapp2 <http://code.google.com/p/webapp-improved/>`_ is a lightweight Python
web framework compatible with Google App Engine's
`webapp <http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/>`_.

webapp2 is a `single file <http://code.google.com/p/webapp-improved/source/browse/webapp2.py>`_
that follows the simplicity of webapp, but improves it in some ways: it extends
webapp to offer better URI routing and exception handling, a full featured
response object and a more flexible dispatching mechanism.

webapp2 also offers the package `webapp2_extras <http://code.google.com/p/webapp-improved/source/browse/#hg%2Fwebapp2_extras>`_
with several optional utilities: sessions, localization, internationalization,
domain and subdomain routing, secure cookies and support for threaded
environments.

webapp2 can also be used outside of Google App Engine, independently of the
App Engine SDK.

For a complete description of how webapp2 improves webapp, see :ref:`features`.

webapp2 is a superset of `webapp <http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/>`_,
created by the App Engine team.

Because webapp2 is intended to be compatible with webapp, the official webapp
documentation is valid for webapp2 too. Parts of this documentation were ported
from `the official documentation for App Engine/Python <http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/>`_,
written by the App Engine team and licensed under the Creative Commons

webapp2 has code ported from `Werkzeug <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_ and
`Tipfy <http://www.tipfy.org/>`_.

webapp2_extras has code ported from Werkzeug, Tipfy and
`Tornado Web Server <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_.

The `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ theme mimics the
`App Engine official documentation <http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/>`_.
