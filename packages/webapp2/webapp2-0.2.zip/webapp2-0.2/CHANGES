Version 0.2 - August 04, 2010
=============================
- Fixed a bug in Route.match() that would make it return positional arguments
  with wrong order. Dictionary is correctly sorted now.
- Added build_only option for rules: rules that are only used for url_for() and
  never match.


Version 0.1 - August 03, 2010
=============================
- Initial release.
