        ==============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The  *p4a.plonevideo* package is an integration component for integrating
        the  *p4a.video* framework with the Plone platform.  It was inspired by
        the Plone ATVideo product and even borrows some UI.
        
        Project Description
        -------------------
        The *p4a.plonevideo* product lets you upload a normal File to your Plone
        site. It uses *p4a.video* to:
        * auto-detect the object as a video file
        * auto-extract the video metadata
        * render an appropriate view (depending on the file format)
