Description: 
        
        The main purpose of this product is to provide a very simple to use
        Google Maps integration for Plone. The following goals were set for
        development:
        
        - Ease of use
            - Add locations to a folder
            - Set the view of the folder to Map
            - It figures out how to center and zoom the map automatically
        - Flexibility for enhancement by using the Zope 3 component architecture
        - Sane fallbacks when Javascript is not available
        - Clean separation of javascript, templates and logic
        - Works on Smart Folders
        
        Additionally Maps has the following features:
        
        - Support for existing markers from qPloneGoogleMaps
        - Support for content which has a location set with the geolocation
          product
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        In Plone 3.0 Maps shows up in the "Add-on Products" configuration panel.
        
        To use Google Maps you need an "Google Maps API key from
        Google":http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html.
        
        In Plone 3.0 you can use the "Maps settings" configuration panel to add
        keys.
        
        You need to use the URL at which your site is normally available from the
        outside (most likely your own domain). You can just use the root of your site
        for the registration and the key will automatically be used for all maps on
        the site. If you have a map on your site which sees much traffic, then you
        may want to register another key for it's URL, so the volume limits from
        Google Maps are spread out a bit.
        
        Two keys are included for testing with the following URLs:
        
        - http://localhost:8080
        - http://testing:8080
        
        
        UK and China address search
        ---------------------------
        
        The default Google Maps geocoding (search for coordinates by address) doesn't
        work everywhere. As of May 2007 it doesn't work in the UK and China for
        example.
        
        We have added a workaround for this. To activate this workaround feature
        you'll have to add a key for Google AJAX Search to enable search for those
        regions.
        
        To use the Google AJAX Search fallback, you need an "Google AJAX Search API
        key from Google":http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html.
        
        In Plone 3.0 you can use the "Maps settings" configuration panel to add
        keys.
        
        The same rules as for the map key apply, see above.

        ------------
        
        - Plone 3.0.x or Plone 3.1.x on Zope 2.10.x

          [rossp]
        
        2.0.1 - 2010-01-19
        ------------------

        ----------------
        
        - Add a metadata.xml to the GenericSetup profile.
          [wichert]
        
        - Refactored to make it easier to use Maps in custom content types. If you
          write a content type and use a field named 'geolocation', then you can use
          default implementations of adapters now instead of writing three on your own.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Moved to common egg file layout. This means there will be no more
          tarball releases, because the docs are outside of the Products folder.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Converted HISTORY.txt and README.txt to reStructureText.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added a simple buildout configuration to the package, to be able to
          develop and test it on its own.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.2 - July 3, 2008
        ------------------
        
        - Added greek translation.
          [ggozad]
        
        - Updated templates for Plone 3.0.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Dropped compatibility with Plone 2.5.
          [fschulze]
        
        1.1 - September 05, 2007
        ------------------------
        
        - Fixed the logic when to show layers.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed viewing of maps if the workflow state was 'private'. There is a
          new interface and view which only has the 'enabled' attribute and which
          is accessible without restriction. This is now used as the condition in
          portal_javascripts.
          [fschulze]
        
        - The coordinates field now uses a tuple with two floats everywhere. The
          widget for it now uses two input fields.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Made LinguaPlone aware.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added custom view for locations. The map is smaller at the upper right
          and the rich text is shown besides it.
          [fschulze]
        
        1.1rc1 - May 17, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - Added configlet for Plone 3.0.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed scrolling of map when clicking on pin. This only happend when
          there were no layers.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed functionality of layer checkboxes for IE6/7.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed key lookup when the URL has a trailing slash.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added fallback to Google AJAX Search if the Google Maps geocoding did
          not return any results. This allows you to search for cities i.e. the
          UK and China.
          [fschulze]
        
        1.0 - May 03, 2007
        ------------------
        
        - Changed the markup. All markers are in one definition list instead of
          one marker in one list. A dt with class="title" marks the beginning of
          a new marker.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for layers. The default is to take keywords as the name
          of the layer in which a marker is visible. Then you get a map control
          with checkboxes for each keyword and you can view/hide the markers with
          that.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Using GenericSetup for installation.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for existing qPloneGoogleMaps markers.
          Added support of content with location from the geolocation product.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added RichText field to Location objects.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for tabbed info windows.
          [fschulze]
        
        
        0.5 - April 02, 2007
        --------------------
