Description: ``sendlib``
        ===========
        
        ``sendlib`` is a lightweight library for serializing messages, usually to be
        sent over a socket, pipe, or other stream. Sendlib is specialized for
        sending messages which are read serially, unlike other serialization formats
        often used (like JSON_, YAML_, or XML_).
        
        .. _JSON: http://json.org/
        .. _YAML: http://yaml.org/
        .. _XML: http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/
        
        Why not JSON, YAML, or XML? ``sendlib`` natively supports reading messages
        one piece at a time, to keep memory footprint small, and has native support
        for sending and receiving file-like objects with the ``data`` type.
        
        If your application needs to send and receive large data blobs, especially
        if your application can process that data without random access, ``sendlib``
        may be a good fit to reduce memory usage. On the other hand, if you need
        random access to fields within your message, have small messages, or have
        messages with, or complex nesting structures, then ``sendlib`` may not be
        for you.
