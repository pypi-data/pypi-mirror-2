What's Conchocotpus?
====================

It's an environment that simplifies working with multiple SSH servers in an asynchronous way.
This environment consists of a task class, a config class and an console utility for managing
tasks' execution.Task class provides API for running remote and local commands and it's a base 
class for implementing tasks created by users.Config class contains information like a list
of hosts to run task on or keys to use when connecting to remote servers.Tasks are executed
using a console utility that let a user track tasks' execution progress.

The project was started as an attempt to simplify Twisted Conch API by implementing something similar
to the Fabric API on the top of it.
