        ===========
        mekk.nozbe
        ===========
        
        ``mekk.nozbe`` wraps (noticeable parts of) Nozbe_ API as Python
        functions. 
        
        It uses both old, officially published API
        (http://www.nozbe.com/gtd/api) and new (not yet officially docunented)
        "Sync API". Neither of those APIs is fully covered (the module
        supports the functions which were working at early 2009 and which I
        needed), but still I succesfully use the library to extract projects,
        contexts and tasks from Nozbe and to create new (or update existing)
        items.
        
        The code is currently using Twisted network interface (that means
        returning deferreds etc). Well, I like Twisted. *I consider providing
        urllib-based synchronous API as an alternative, just need some
        motivation.*
        
        nozbetool
        =========
        
        Apart from the library, nozbetool script is bundled. Run::
        
            nozbetool --help
        
        for details. Most common usages:
        
            nozbetool export --csv=file.csv --user=YourNozbeUsername
        
        (export to .csv)
        
            nozbetool export --json=file.json --user=YourNozbeUsername --completed
        
        (export to .json, completed actions are included).
        
        Development

        Development is tracked on http://bitbucket.org/Mekk/mekk.nozbe/

        Example
        ========
        
        Some simple example::
        
            from mekk.nozbe import NozbeApi, NozbeConnection
            from twisted.internet import reactor, defer
        
            # API KEY servers as an authentication token. 
            # Check for your own at Nozbe extras page (http://www.nozbe.com/account/extras).
            # Note that publishing it is equivalent to publishing the password.
            API_KEY = "grab your own from Nozbe"
        
            @defer.inlineCallbacks
            def make_some_calls():
                connection =  NozbeConnection(API_KEY)
                nozbe_client = NozbeApi()
        
                print "* Some projects"
                projects = yield nozbe_client.get_projects()
                for project in projects[:3]:
                    print project
                print
        
                print "* Some contexts"
                contexts = yield nozbe_client.get_contexts()
                for context in contexts[:3]:
                    print context
                print
        
                print "* Some tasks"
                tasks = yield nozbe_client.get_tasks()
                for task in tasks[:3]:
                    print task
                print
        
                print "Adding example task"
                yield nozbe_client.add_task(
                    u"Example task made using script",
                    project_hash = projects[0]['hash'],
                    context_hash = contexts[0]['hash'],
                    next = 1)
        
            @defer.inlineCallbacks
            def main():
                try:
                    yield make_some_calls()
                finally:
                    reactor.stop()
        
            reactor.callLater(0, main)
            reactor.run()
