        =====
        
        forbi is a TCP-based communication tool with PKCS#1 OAEP RSA
        encryption. It consists of a server and a client. The server keeps
        track of online users and forwards messages from clients to other
        clients. It is easy to configure what the forbi client should do when
        it receives a message. Its default action is to show it in a small
        window.
        
        forbi is designed to be both a secure message sender and a "pre-chat"
        message mechanism. If you want one of your friends to join an IRC
        channel, for example, you simply send him a message::
        
          $ forbi-send 'Mr. Spock' 'Come to #thechannel now!'
        
        (Note that this will only work if both you and your friend have forbi
        clients running.)
        
        Because your friend has his forbi client configured in a way that
        works best for him (perhaps he has configured his client to run a
        program that makes a lot of noise when he receives a message, or maybe
        something else), he is sure to notice your message.

        Installing
        ==========
        
        Way #1
        ------
        
        Just run this (requires that you have python-setuptools installed)::
        
          # easy_install forbi
        
        
        Way #2
        ------
        
        Get the newest version of forbi at http://metanohi.org/projects/forbi/
        or at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/forbi
        
        Extract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::
        
          # python setup.py install
        
          
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Python 2.6 is required. Python 3.x cannot be used because at least one
        of the required modules requires Python 2.x.
        
        ``m2crypto``
         + Web address: http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto
         + License: Modified BSD license
         + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-m2crypto`` (or something similar)
        
        ``dbus``
         + Web address: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
         + License: Expat license
         + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-dbus`` (or something similar)
        
        ``gobject``
         + Web address: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
         + License: LGPL 2.1+
         + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-gobject`` (or something similar)
        
        ``tk``
         + Web address: 
         + License: Python Software Foundation License
         + Installing: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-tk`` (or something similar)
        
        
        Optional extras
        ---------------
        
        If present, forbi will also use these Python modules:
        
        ``termcolor``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor/
         + License: GPLv3+
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install termcolor``
        
        Note that ``termcolor`` is included with forbi, so you don't
        really have to install it.
         
        ``setproctitle``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/
         + License: New BSD License
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install setproctitle``
        
        
        Using
        =====
        
        To see a list of forbi's command-line options, run ``forbi --help``.
        
        
        As a client
        -----------
        
        The forbi client can only be used together with a forbi server. If you
        don't know of anyone with a forbi server, you can run the server on
        the same computer as your client. In this case, the host address you
        must give the forbi client is ``localhost``.
        
        The client will run just fine with no command-line arguments. To start
        it, just run ``forbi``. When it is up and running, you can send
        commands to it with ``forbi-send``. To see what commands exist and
        what arguments they require, run ``forbi-send --help``.
        
        See the ``examples/`` directory for simple message receival scripts.
        
        
        As a server
        -----------
        
        It is equally easy to run forbi as a server. The simplest way is to
        run ``forbi -s``. Be aware that while data transportation in forbi
        is secure, protection against overflooding is non-existent. Anyone can
        register as a user on a forbi server, and there are no limits (except
        for those imposed by the underlying system) on how many clients can be
        connected to the server at the same time.
        
        
        In general
        ----------
        
        forbi works by sending commands back and forth between server and
        clients. These commands are not at all frozen and could very well
        change in any eventual new releases. There are no detailed
        descriptions of how the responses to commands should be, but it works
        for now.
        
        forbi supports adjusting settings using a config file. To see an
        example of such a config file, take a look at ``forbi.conf`` in the
        ``examples/`` directory of this distribution.

        Developing
        ==========
        
        forbi is written in Python and uses Git for branches. To get the
        latest branch, get it from gitorious.org like this::
        
          $ git clone git://gitorious.org/forbi/forbi.git
