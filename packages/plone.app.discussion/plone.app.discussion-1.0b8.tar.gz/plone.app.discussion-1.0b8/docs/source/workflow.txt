Workflow and permissions...


Workflow
========

plone.app.discussion ships with a simple one-state workflow and a review 
workflow for comments:

1) **Comment Single State Workflow**: 

   Essentially a workflow with no transitions, but it has a Published state, 
   so portlets and applications that expect that state will continue to work.
  
  
2) **Comment Review Workflow**: A simple review workflow for comments

Comment Review Workflow
-----------------------

The comment review workflow comes with two states (pending and published) and
one transition (publish).

The 'pending' state is the initial state. 'published' is the state where the
comment is visible to everyone and non-editable.

The 'publish' transition is protected by the 'Review comments' permission.

  * --> [pending] -- {publish} --> [published]--> *
