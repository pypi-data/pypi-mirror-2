Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package shows you how to use collective.transmogrifier to import news items into Plone.
        
        By default, it uses dummy values that are hard-coded in the product itself to create some News Items,
        so you can see how to even use transmogrifier. 
        
        The main idea is that you can use this product as a skeleton for migrating content from other systems to Plone,
        since you only need to pass in correct data instead of hard-coded dummy values.
        
        Examples of real-life parsing HTML to extract data you need can be found in /branches folder of the product's repository at http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/niteoweb.transmogrifier.simpleusage/branches/.
        
        The product sets the following fields on newly created News Items:
        
            - title
            - text
            - date
            - category
            - author
        
        
        Demo
        ====
        
        Run the following set of commands::
        
            $ cd <workspace>
            $ virtualenv -p python2.4 --no-site-packages simpleusage
            $ cd simpleusage
            $ svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/niteoweb.transmogrifier.simpleusage/trunk ./
            $ bin/python bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
            $ bin/instance fg
            
        Then start your favorite browser and point it to http://localhost:8080/manage to add a new Plone site.
        You can now use the following URL to start importing News Items: http://localhost:8080/<your_site_id>/@@import
        
        
        Customizing
        ===========
        
        First, create a branch for you to work on::
        
            $ cd <workspace>
            $ virtualenv -p python2.4 --no-site-packages johns_migration
            $ cd johns_migration
            $ svn copy https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/niteoweb.transmogrifier.simpleusage/trunk https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/niteoweb.transmogrifier.simpleusage/branches/johns_migration
        
            
        Then, checkout your branch and build a development environment::
        
            $ svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/niteoweb.transmogrifier.simpleusage/branches/johns_migration ./
            $ bin/python bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
        
        Now you have everything you need to start your own migration. Open <workspace>/johns_migration/src/niteoweb.transmogrifier.simpleusage/transmogrifier.py in your favorite text editor.
        Scroll all the way to the bottom to find a method 'source' and modify it so that it parses data from your source and returns it as a list of dicts. 
        
        Once you're done, start Zope and point your browser tohttp://localhost:8080/<your_site_id>/@@import to start importing!
