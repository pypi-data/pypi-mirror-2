Description: ("========\nGluttony\n========\n\nGluttony is a tool for finding dependency relationships among Python \nprjects in PyPi, it is based on `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_.\n\n.. image:: http://static.ez2learn.com/gluttony/gluttony.jpg\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install Gluttony\n\n::\n\n    easy_install Gluttony\n    \nUsage\n=====\nFor understanding optons of Gluttony, you can type:\n::\n\n    gluttony --help\n    \nAlso, once your're familiar with pip install, most of the options are same.\n\nDrawing Graph\n=============\n\nTo know dependency relationships\n\n::\n\n    gluttony <project name> --display-graph\n\nFor example: you want to know the dependency relationships of a \nPython project `Sprox <http://sprox.org/>`_, then you can type::\n\n    gluttony sprox --display-graph\n\nThe result might looks like this:\n\n.. image:: http://static.ez2learn.com/gluttony/sprox.png\n\nAlso, it also supports most of command of ``pip install``, for example: \nyou want to know the relations among `TurboGears2 <http://turbogears.org/>`_ packages, here we type\n\n::\n\n    gluttony -i http://www.turbogears.org/2.0/downloads/current/index tg.devtools --display-graph\n\nThe result:\n\n.. image:: http://static.ez2learn.com/gluttony/tg2.png\n\nOops, the graph is a mess.  I didn't handle layout of graph.  I have not time \nto finish it right now.  Fortunately, you can output the graph as dot or \npickle format file for further handling.\n\nOutput Graphviz File\n====================\nIn order to draw the diagram with Graphviz, you can output that format.\nFor example:\n\n::\n\n    gluttony sprox --pydot sprox.dot\n\t\nThen you can use `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ for drawing beautiful \ngraph. Like this one:\n\n.. image:: http://static.ez2learn.com/gluttony/sprox_dot.png\n\nAnother huge example:\n\n`Dependency relationship digram of TurboGears2 <http://static.ez2learn.com/gluttony/tg2_dot.png>`_\n\nOutput Pickle File\n==================\nIf you want to get the relationships data in Python form, this tool also \nprovide a pickle output. For example:\n\n::\n\n    gluttony sprox --pickle sprox.pickle\n\t\nThen you can use pickle.load for further processing.\n\nGallery\n=======\n\n`Gallery <http://code.google.com/p/python-gluttony/wiki/Gallery>`_\n\nAuthor\n======\n\n * Victor Lin (bornstub at gmail.com)\n * Twitter: `victorlin <http://twitter.com/victorlin>`_\n * Blog: `Victor's Blog <http://blog.ez2learn.com>`_",)
