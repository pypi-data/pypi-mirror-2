# FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform 
# (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real 
# and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete 
# cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).

# The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform open-source 
# C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms 
# for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target 
# platform. OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single 
# header file. GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems, 
# including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.
