COMPONENTS PACKAGE

This File contains all of the functionality of RSF

adding a new component

This system makes it easy to add a new component by 
having a standard directory structure

directory structure:
========================|    
    - component_name/   | can be named anything just like the user folders 
                        |
      - configure/      | configure each component separately
        - SConfig       |  (should have a 'config' alias) and install result into tools/config<name>.py
                        |
      - doc/            | generate components documentation
        - SConstruct    |  (should have a 'docs' alias)
                        |
      - includes/       | either header files put in here or built into here form src
        ...             |
                        |
      - src/            | source files for generating libraries
        ...             |
        - SConscript    | (should have a 'libs' and 'buildlibs' alias)
                        |
      - test/           | 
        - SConstruct    | (should have a 'test' and 'buildtest' alias)
                        |
      - tools/          | put scons tools modules in here along with configure files to be installed
        *.py            | from the main SConstruct
========================|

This way a developer does not have to modify existing code to add new functionality
