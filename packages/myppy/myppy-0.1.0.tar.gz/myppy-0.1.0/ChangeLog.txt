v0.1.0:

    * This is the first version so nothing's changed, right?

      Well, this code used to be in a project called "plipy" because it
      built a "portable linux python".  Then it grew support for building
      under OSX and it become "pulpy" for "portable unix-like python". Now
      I've got this crazy notion to try the same thing for win32, and the
      name just keeps on changing...

      So the project is new, but the code has been kicked around a fair bit.
      I think I've got it mostly right this time.
