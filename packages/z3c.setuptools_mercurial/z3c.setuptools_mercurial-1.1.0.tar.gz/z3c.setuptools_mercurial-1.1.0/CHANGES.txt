1.1.0 (2010-08-30)
------------------

- Feature: Make ``z3c.setuptools_mercurial`` compatible with Buildout 1.5,
  which does not include the standard PYTHONPATH by default anymore. This
  caused mercurial not to find its library.

- Feature: Use ``doctest`` instead of ``zope.testing.doctest``.

- Feature: Update coverage setup.


1.0.1 (2009-12-16)
------------------

- Feature: Add a test for getting the file list within a sub-directory of the
  repository.

- Bug: It turns out that setuptools does not like "./<path>" notation but only
  "<path>". Fixed the problem.


1.0.0 (2009-12-15)
------------------

- Initial release.
