Description: Bombardier is a software system that delivers visibility, control
        and automation to datacenter environments. Bombardier provides a means
        for changes to be rolled out to a network of servers in a highly
        controlled way, providing optimum security, logging, centralized
        change control.
        
        What happens when systems you're responsible for go offline?
        
        * Do you get paged?
        * Are you part of a team that needs to respond immediately?
        * Are your products or services potentially at risk?
        * Is your job or livelihood at risk?
        
        If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then Bombardier may be
        for you. Bombardier makes application deployment, minor changes, and
        routine maintenance much more reliable and secure. It also provides you
        with a degree of insight into the changes that are going on within your
        production datacenter that you may have never seen before.
