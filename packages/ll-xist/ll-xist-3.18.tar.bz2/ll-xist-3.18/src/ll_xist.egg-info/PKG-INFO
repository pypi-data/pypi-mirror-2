Description: XIST provides an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser
        with a very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds
        to a Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to
        transform the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered
        'object oriented XSLT'.
        
        XIST also includes the following modules and packages:
        
        * ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows
          you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed
          when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one
          of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented
          way and targets are not only limited to files.
        
        * ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396
          compliant URLs.
        
        * ``ll.orasql`` provides utilities for working with cx_Oracle_:
        
          - It allows calling functions and procedures with keyword arguments.
        
          - Query results will be put into Record objects, where database fields
            are accessible as object attributes.
        
          - The ``Connection`` class provides methods for iterating through the
            database metadata.
        
          - Importing the modules adds support for URLs with the scheme ``oracle`` to
            ``ll.url``.
        
          .. _cx_Oracle: http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/
        
        * ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a templating language with similar capabilities
          to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates are compiled to an
          internal bytecode format, which makes it possible to implement template
          renderers in other languages and makes the template code "secure" (i.e.
          template code can't open or delete files).
        
          __ http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/
        
        * ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape
          sequences).
        
        * ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.
          This includes the ability to convert between different color models
          (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions
          for modifying and mixing colors.
        
        * ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.
        
        * ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.
        
        * ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.
        
        * ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.
        
        * ``ll.nightshade`` can be used to serve the output of PL/SQL
          functions/procedures with CherryPy__.

        Changes in 3.18 (released 04/08/2011)
        -------------------------------------
        
        * Fixed a regression in ``ll.orasql.OracleConnection``.
        
        * Fixed ``ZeroDivisionError`` in script ``uls`` for empty directories.
        
        * Added a class method ``ll.orasql.Contraint.iternames`` and a class method
          ``ll.orasql.Index.iternames`` that skips those indexes that are generated
          by constraints. With this addition ``uls``/``ucp`` now list/copy constraints
          and indexes properly. All ``iternames`` methods now skip objects whose name
          starts with ``BIN$``.
        
        * The scripts ``uls``, ``ucp`` and ``ucat`` have new options ``--include``
          and ``--exclude`` for including/excluding URLs that match a regular
          expression. They also have an new option ``--all`` to include/exclude
          dot files (i.e. files/directories whose name starts with a dot)
        
        * ``ucp`` now supports to new options ``--padding`` and
          ``--separator`` which are used for column output.
        
        * Two unused options were removed: ``--verbose`` from the script ``ucat``
          and ``--defaults`` from the script ``tld2xsc``.
        
        * ``ucp -x`` now prints exception details.
        
        * The variables available in UL4 templates used by ``db2ul4`` have changed.
          Instead of a ``connect`` object, there are now three objects for each
          supported database (i.e. ``oracle``, ``sqlite`` and ``mysql``)
        
        * The script ``doc2txt`` now reads from ``stdin`` and writes to ``stdout``
          instead of requiring file names on the command line.
        
        * If the scripts ``xml2xsc`` or ``dtd2xsc`` are called without arguments
          ``stdin`` is read.
        
        * ``ll.xist.ns.rest`` now handles option lists.
        
        * The Oracle URLs provided by ``ll.orasql`` now have a ``.sql`` extension
          for all schema objects. On writing a ``.sql`` extension will be stripped to
          get the name of the schema object.
        
        * Oracle URLs now should support schema objects with fancy names (i.e. ones
          that contain accented characters).
        
        * ``ll.orasql.Table`` has a new method ``organization`` that returns
          ``"heap"`` or normal tables and ``"index"`` for index organized tables.
        
        * Pretty printing of XIST trees can now be customized with the class attributes
          ``prettyindentbefore`` and ``prettyindentafter``. The values will be
          added to the current indentation level before and after the node in question.
        
        * All scripts that are part of XIST (``uls``, ``ucp``, ``ucat``, ``db2ul4``,
          ``dtd2xsc``, ``tld2xsc``, ``doc2txt``, ``xml2xsc``, ``oracreate``,
          ``oradrop``, ``oradelete``, ``oradiff``, ``oramerge``, ``oragrant`` and
          ``orafind``) are now properly documented on the webpages.
