Description: Synthesis is a Health and Human Services Data Integration Server. It moves us closer to the vision of seamless human services data integration. Synthesis currently imports and exports HUD HMIS formats, but could be extended to handle any human services data formats. Eventually will handle the nascent NIEM Human Services format. Composed of a REST web service. Also can listen for received FTP files.
