Description: ===========
        irclog2html
        ===========
        
        Converts IRC log files to HTML with pretty colours.
        
        
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        Installation::
        
          pip install irclog2html
        
        Quick usage for a single log file::
        
          irclog2html --help
          irclog2html filename.log                  (produces filename.log.html)
        
        Mass-conversion of logs (one file per day, with YYYY-MM-DD in the filename)
        with next/prev links, with mtime checks, usable from cron::
        
          logs2html directory/            (looks for *.log, produces *.log.html)
        
        You'll probably also want to copy irclog.css to the directory with HTML files,
        as irclog2html doesn't do that yet.
        
        
        CGI script for log searching
        ============================
        
        .. warning: the script can be easily abused to cause a denial of service attack
        
        You can generate search boxes on IRC log pages by passing the ``--searchbox``
        option to ``logs2html``.  Here's an example Apache config snippet that makes
        it work::
        
          RewriteRule ^/my-irclog/search/$ /my-irclog/search [R,L]
          ScriptAlias /my-irclog/search /usr/local/bin/irclogsearch
          <Location /my-irclog/search>
            SetEnv IRCLOG_LOCATION "/var/www/my-irclog/"
          </Location>
