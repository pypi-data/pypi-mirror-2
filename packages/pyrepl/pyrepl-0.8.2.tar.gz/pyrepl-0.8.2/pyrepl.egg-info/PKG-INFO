Description: pyrepl is a Python library, inspired by readline, for building flexible
        command line interfaces, featuring:
         * sane multi-line editing
         * history, with incremental search
         * completion, including displaying of available options
         * a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode keybindings
         * a liberal, Python-style, license
         * a new python top-level.
