Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Hook is a system based on zope.event.
        
        To make a method hookable, you first need to define an event that provide at least IHookEvent.
        
        Next you can use collective.hook.decorator.hook(MyEventClassHook) to decorate your method.
        
        Define a handler as usual:
        
        <subscriber
        for="my.module.IMyHook"
        handler="my.module.my_hook" />
        
        Warning: This event is triggered two times. So you need in your hook to check the value
        of before boolean attribute or after boolean attribute. The event store the result
        of the call in the attribute 'returned_value'
        
        There are also hooked_args and hooked_kwargs if you want to play with arguments.
