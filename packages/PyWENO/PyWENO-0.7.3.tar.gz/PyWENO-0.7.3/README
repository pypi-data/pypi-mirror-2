PyWENO
======

PyWENO (aka scikits.weno) is a Python module for computing high-order
Weighted Essentially Non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstructions of
cell-averaged data arrays.

The basic interface provides a simple routine to compute 1D
reconstructions at various points within each grid cell.  The points
at which the basic interface can reconstruct the original function at
include: left edge, right edge, Gauss-Legendre quadrature points,
Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points, and Guass-Radau quadrature points.

PyWENO can also be used as a code generator to build custom WENO
reconstructors in C, Fortran, and OpenCL.
