Description: Servermgr is a collection of classes that make it easier to manage external programs that are running for the sole benefit of your application.
        
        Sample use cases:
        
        * Your program wants to run its own copy of Postgres with a separate data directory on its own port;
        * Your program wants to control its own dedicated copy of Nginx to use as a front-end;
        
        In either of these cases, there is no need to configure multiple programs to run your application - 
        you can simply configure the appropriate server manager object and go!
