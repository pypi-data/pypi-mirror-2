Products.Calendaring
====================

A simple calendar implementation for CMF/Plone,  which does
all sorts of really cool stuff.  It is made to be modular and
gives a great out-of-the-box experience.

Features
--------

- Import/Export of iCal events

- Hooks PUT_Factory so you can put events with DAV/FTP.

- NOTE: This works very well with Publishing feature
    with OSX's iCal application.

- calendar_export is subscribable from iCal

- Reliably exports events for KOrganizer, iCal and Outlook

- There is a proper Calendar object which can store Events.

- Over 60 unit tests that cover almost all of the functionality
  REQUIRES: ZopeTestCase from http://sf.net/projects/collective
