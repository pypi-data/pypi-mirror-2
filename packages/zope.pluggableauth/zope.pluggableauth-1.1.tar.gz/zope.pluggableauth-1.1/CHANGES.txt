1.1 (2010-10-18)
----------------

* Moved concrete IAuthenticatorPlugin implementations from
  zope.app.authentication to zope.pluggableauth.plugins.

  As a result projects that want to use the IAuthenticator plugins (previously
  found in zope.app.authentication) do not automatically also pull in the
  zope.app.* dependencies that are needed to register the ZMI views.

1.0.3 (2010-07-09)
------------------

* Fixed dependency declaration.

1.0.2 (2010-07-90)
------------------

* Added persistent.Persistent and zope.container.contained.Contained as
  bases zope.pluggableauth.plugins.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin, so
  instances of zope.app.authentication.session.SessionCredentialsPlugin
  won't be changed.

1.0.1 (2010-02-11)
------------------

* Adapters are now declared in a new ZCML file :
  `principalfactories.zcml`. This avoids duplication errors in
  ``zope.app.authentication``.

1.0 (2010-02-05)
----------------

* Splitting off from zope.app.authentication
