.. currentmodule:: segtools

Segtools is a Python package designed to put genomic segmentations back
in the context of the genome! Using R for graphics, Segtools provides a
number of modules to analyze a segmentation in various ways and help
you interpret its biological relevance.

For a broad overview, please see the manuscript:

  Buske OJ, Hoffman MM, Noble WS, "Exploratory analysis of genomic
  segmentations with Segtools." Under revision.

Orion <stasis at uw dot edu> can send you the latest copy of the manuscript.
Please cite the manuscript if you use Segtools.

.. note:: For questions, comments, or troubleshooting, please refer to
          the support_ section.


Installation
============
A simple, interactive script_ has been created to install Segtools
(and most dependencies) on any Linux platform. Installation is as simple
as downloading and running this script! For instance::

   wget http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/segtools/install.py
   python install.py

.. note::
   The following prerequisites must be installed first:

   - Python 2.5.1-2.7
   - Zlib


Basics
======
A segmentation is typically a partition of a genome (or part of a genome)
into non-overlapping segments, each of which is assigned one of a small
set of labels. The idea is that segments that share a common label are somehow
similar, and those that have different labels are somehow different.
Segtools helps you identify the similarities and differences between these
labels to help you understand your segmentation at a higher level.


Input
=====
Segmentations should be in `BED format`_ or `GFF format`, with one 
line for each segment and the ``name`` field used to specify the segment
label. For best results, the number of unique segment labels should
be between 2 and around 40. For segmentations, Segtools uses fields ``1-4``
of a BED file or fields ``1,3-5``  of a GFF file.

If you want to change the order in which labels appear or the
text displayed in plots, a `mnemonic file`_ can be created.
Segtools commands can the be re-run with the ``--replot`` flag and
the ``--mnemonic-file=<FILE>`` option to regenerate the plots without
redoing the computation. Similarly, mnemonic files can be swapped or
revised and new images created with relative ease.

Most Segtools commands look for patterns between segment labels in a
segmentation and some known annotation. For such commands, the annotations
are often specified in `BED format`_ or `GFF format`_ (although some commands
require GTF_ or Genomedata_ formats).


Usage
=====

The basic workflow for using key Segtools commands is shown below.
Segmentations can also be created from other segmentations, annotations, or
peak-calls using :ref:`segtools-flatten <segtools-flatten>`.

Segtools commands can be run through their
:ref:`command-line <command-line-interface>`
or :ref:`Python <python-interface>`
interfaces.


.. _`command-line-interface`:

Command-line interface
----------------------

Core commands:

- :ref:`segtools-aggregation <segtools-aggregation>`: 
  Analyzes the relative 
  occurrence of each segment label around the provided genomic features.
- :ref:`segtools-transition <segtools-transition>`: 
  Analyzes the transitions 
  between segment labels and the structure of their interaction.
- :ref:`segtools-length-distribution <segtools-length-distribution>`: 
  Analyzes the distribution 
  of segment lengths and their coverage of the genome for each segment label.
- :ref:`segtools-signal-distribution <segtools-signal-distribution>`:
  Analyzes the distribution 
  of genomic signal tracks for each segment label.
- :ref:`segtools-nucleotide-frequency <segtools-nucleotide-frequency>`: 
  Analyzes the frequencies 
  of nucleotides and dinucleotides in segments of each label.
- :ref:`segtools-overlap <segtools-overlap>`: 
  Analyzes the frequency with which 
  each segment label overlaps features of various types.
- :ref:`segtools-html-report <segtools-html-report>`: 
  Combines the output of the 
  other commands and generates an html report for easier viewing.

Utility commands:

- :ref:`segtools-compare <segtools-compare>`: 
  Measure base-wise edit distance 
  between two segmentations.
- :ref:`segtools-feature-distance <segtools-feature-distance>`: 
  Reports the distance from 
  each segment to the nearest feature in each of a list of feature files.
- :ref:`segtools-flatten <segtools-flatten>`: 
  General tool for flattening 
  overlapping segments, but flattens them into segments defined 
  by the set of segment labels that overlap the region. 
- :ref:`segtools-preprocess <segtools-preprocess>`:
  Preprocess segmentation and annotation files into a binary format
  that can be quickly re-read in future calls to Segtools commands.

Other commands:

- :ref:`segtools-gmtk-parameters <segtools-gmtk-parameters>`: 
  Analyzes GMTK_ emission parameters and state transitions.

All the above commands respond to ``-h`` and ``--help``, and this will
display the most up-to-date usage information and options.

Where relevant, commands accept `mnemonic files <mnemonic file>`_
through the ``--mnemonic-file`` option.

Each core command generates:

- tab-delimited (``tab``) data files
- image files (in ``png`` and ``pdf`` format and in 
  normal, thumbnail, and slide layouts), and 
- partial HTML (``div``) files.


Common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options are frequently or always supported by
Segtools commands:

.. cmdoption:: --clobber

   Overwrite existing output files if there is a conflict.

.. cmdoption:: --help, -h

   Display up-to-date usage information and options for the command.

.. cmdoption:: --noplot

   Perform computation and output tab files but do not generating plots.

.. cmdoption:: --mnemonic-file <file>, -m <file>

   Specify a mnemonic file to control the label display and ordering.
   See `mnemonic file details <mnemonic file>`_. 

.. cmdoption:: --outdir <dir>, -o <dir>

   Specify the directory where output files should be placed (will be
   be generated if it does not exist).

.. cmdoption:: --quick

   Output results after running command on only one chromosome (which
   chromosome is unspecified). This can be useful for testing.

.. cmdoption:: --quiet, -q

   Don't print diagnostic messages and status updates.

.. cmdoption:: --replot

   Load tab file data generated from a previous run of this program
   and recreate plots instead of recomputing tab file data. Tab files
   are expected to be in the default or specified output directory
   (with --outdir).

.. cmdoption:: --version

   Print the current program version.


.. _`python-interface`:

Python interface
----------------

Segtools commands can be run directly from Python by importing the
corresponding module and running its ``main()`` method with the same
arguments you would specify on the command line. For instance, you could
run `segtools-length-distribution -opt ARG` from Python with the following:

>>> from segtools import length_distribution
>>> length_distribution.main(["-opt", "ARG"])

Commands
========

.. ####################### COMPARE #######################

.. _segtools-compare:

segtools-compare
----------------

.. program:: segtools-compare

**segtools-compare [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION SEGMENTATION**

This command compares two segmentations by a specified metric. Currently,
the only supported metric is :option:`--edit-distance`.

**Selected options**:

.. cmdoption:: --edit-distance, -d

   Prints (to stout) the base-wise edit distance between two segmentations.
   This is the number of bases that are assigned different labels in the two
   segmentations.




.. ####################### PREPROCESS #######################

.. _segtools-preprocess:

segtools-preprocess
-------------------

.. program:: segtools-preprocess

**segtools-preprocess [OPTIONS] INFILE**

This command takes a segmentation or annotation file (INFILE) and generates
a binary, preprocessed file (INFILE.pkl) that can be quickly loaded in
subsequent calls to Segtools commands. This is especially useful if you want
to run many Segtools commands on one segmentation. If you don't preprocess
the segmentation, each Segtools command parses the segmentation file
independently. If the segmentation is large, this can add an hour
or more to the runtime of each Segtools command. Preprocessing cuts
this load time to just a few seconds! See ``--help`` for more details.



.. ####################### FEATURE AGGREGATION #######################

.. _segtools-aggregation:

segtools-aggregation
--------------------

.. program:: segtools-aggregation

**segtools-aggregation [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION ANNOTATIONS**

This command looks at the aggregate occurrence of segment labels around
and within annotated features. A typical example of this would be to
look at the relative occurrences of segment labels around transcription
start sites (TSSs). You would do this with something like::

  segtools-aggregation --normalize segmentation.bed tss.gff

If you had two different classes of TSSs that you were interested in
(say, expressed and unexpressed), you can use the 3rd column of the GFF
file as a grouping variable and then specify the :option:`--groups` flag. 

By default, the y-axis of the aggregation plot is the number of 
segments of a given label that overlap a region. This is useful 
in some applications, but more often you are interested in the
enrichment or depletion of various labels relative to what you 
might expect by chance. This is especially true if the segments in
one label are significantly longer than those in another label.
In these cases, the :option:`--normalize` flag should be used.


**Selected options**:

.. cmdoption:: --help, -h

   Display complete usage information

.. cmdoption:: --mode <mode>

   Specify the aggregation mode. The following options are available: 
   ``point``, ``region``, and ``gene``. The default is ``point``.

   ``point``: 
   This mode aggregates around point-like features such as TSSs, TESs,
   or single-base peak calls. This mode looks at where segments 
   occur in the 5' and 3' flanking regions of each feature. If the
   feature annotations have strand specifications (column 7), the aggregation
   is strand-corrected so that the 5' flank region is always upstream
   of the feature. The width (in base pairs) of these flanking regions 
   can be set with the ``--flank-bases`` option (default 500 bp).

   ``region``:
   This mode aggregates around region-like features such as
   transcription factor binding sites, ChIP-seq peak calls,
   or promoter regions. This will be the appropriate mode for most
   annotations. This mode is similar to ``point``, but with the addition
   of an ``internal`` region which is aggregated over as well. To account
   for regions of varying length, evenly-spaced samples are taken from
   the span of each feature. The number of these samples can be set
   with ``--region-samples``. Features than span fewer bases than this
   sample number are skipped.

   ``gene``:
   This is a special mode for aggregating with respect to an idealized
   gene model. Rather than specifying a normal GFF file, the annotation file
   must be in `GTF format`_ and have features with names: ``exon``, ``CDS``,
   as provided by exporting data from the `UCSC Table Browser`_ in 
   `GTF format`_. This mode is similar to ``region``, but with many regions
   that correspond to idealized transcriptional and translational models of
   genes. For the transcriptional model, there are regions
   corresponding to initial, internal, and terminal exons and introns. 
   For the translational model, there are initial, internal, and terminal
   5' and 3' UTR regions, and initial and terminal CDSs. These two models
   are laid out in logical progressions so that genes are
   viewed in profile and gene-component-specific associations can
   be easily seen. Because introns and exons
   are typically different lengths, ``--intron-samples`` and
   ``--exon-samples`` options allow you to specify the number of
   samples that are taken in these regions (like in ``region`` mode).
   *Note: If there are multiple transcripts with the same
   gene ID, the longest transcript is used.*

.. cmdoption:: --normalize

   This option normalizes the y-axis of the aggregation plot,
   displaying enrichment and depletion instead of counts at each
   position. The enrichment of label :math:`l` at position :math:`p`
   is calculated with the following formula:

   .. math:: enrichment(l, p) = \log_2 \dfrac{f_{obs} + 1}{f_{rand} + 1}

   where :math:`f_{obs}` is the observed overlap frequency and
   :math:`f_{obs}` is the overlap frequency expected at random, 
   defined by:
   
   .. math:: 

      f_{obs} = \dfrac{count(l, p)}{\sum_{labels} count(p)}

      f_{rand} = \dfrac{bases\_in\_label(l)}{\sum_{labels} bases\_in\_label}

   The enrichment is thus bounded by :math:`[-1,1]`, with 1
   corresponding to extreme enrichment and -1 to extreme depletion.

.. cmdoption:: --groups

   Group the features by the value of the 3rd column of the GFF or GTF
   file (the ``name`` field). This is useful if you wanted to compare
   the aggregation profiles with respect to multiple classes of
   features, such as TSSs split by expression level or cell type.


.. cmdoption:: --significance

   This option includes the significance of the
   overlap at a region in the plot. If :option:`--groups` is not
   specified or there is only one group, then significance is shown by
   shading the regions that are significant. Otherwise, the significance
   of the various groups are shown using colored "rugs" at the bottom of 
   the plot. The probability of observing :math:`n` overlapping segments
   of a given label at a given position is modeled with a binomial
   distribution: :math:`p = binom(n, N, f_{rand})`, where :math:`N` is the
   total number of overlapping segments at that position and
   :math:`f_{rand}` is the same as in :option:`--normalize`.
   The p-value is then the probability of observing an overlap count
   as extreme or more extreme than :math:`n` (either enrichment or
   depletion). This corresponds to a two-tailed binomial test. These
   pvalues are then transformed to qvalues using Storey et al.'s QVALUE
   R package, which should be installed if you use this option. At the
   moment, it doesn't appear that this significance measure is stringent
   enough, so use extreme caution when interpreting the results of this
   option.

   .. Didn't use note directive because of latex math image backgrounds.

   *Note:* If :math:`n > 100` and :math:`f_{rand}*N < 10`, a Poisson
   approximation is used.



.. ####################### FEATURE DISTANCE #######################

.. _segtools-feature-distance:

segtools-feature-distance
-------------------------

.. program:: segtools-feature-distance

**segtools-feature-distance [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION ANNOTATIONS...**

This command takes a segmentation and one or more annotation files and
prints the distance from each segment to the nearest annotation in each
file. Results are printed in tab-delimited format on stdout::

  chrom<TAB>start<TAB>end<TAB>label<TAB>...

where ``...`` is a tab-delimited list of distances, one per annotation file.

This command can be used in conjunction with other command-line UNIX utilities
to easily sort and filter segments by their distance from important genomics
features. For example, given a segmentation from genomic insulator sites,
you could use this command to find the 100 insulators farthest from any
transcription start site. The command can also be used to filter segments
that overlap annotation sets by filtering for distances of 0.


.. ####################### FLATTEN BED #######################

.. _segtools-flatten:

segtools-flatten
----------------

.. program:: segtools-flatten

**segtools-flatten [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION...**

This command takes multiple segmentations and combinatorially flattens them
into one. Thus, there is a segment boundary in the new segmentation
for every segment boundary in any of the input segmentations. The label for
each new segment corresponds to the combination of labels for segments that
overlap this segment. 

For example, given two files of regions of high transcription factor binding, 
one with peak calls and one with a lower threshold, you could create a single
segmentation from the two files with::

  segtools-flatten peaks.gff regions.bed.gz


The new segmentation would have one segment label for bases that are covered
by regions.bed.gz but not peaks.gff, one for bases covered by both files, and
one for bases covered by only peaks.gff (if there are any).
The command prints the new segmentation in BED format to stout, by default,
but ``--mnemonic-file`` and ``--outfile`` can be specified
to create a segmentation file with a corresponding mnemonic file that
can be used in further Segtools analyses.



.. ####################### GMTK PARAMETERS #######################

.. _segtools-gmtk-parameters:

segtools-gmtk-parameters
------------------------

.. program:: segtools-gmtk-parameters

**segtools-gmtk-parameters [OPTIONS] PARAMSFILE**

This command analyzes the dynamic Bayesian network emission parameters
generated by GMTK_. This is most useful with segmentations generated using
the Segway_ framework, created by Michael Hoffman. This command just calls
the relevant parts of other commands, generating transition plots,
a transition graph, and a heatmap of the mean and standard deviation values
for each label and track. See ``--help`` for more information.



.. ####################### HTML REPORT #######################

.. _segtools-html-report:

segtools-html-report
--------------------

.. program:: segtools-html-report

**segtools-html-report [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION**

This command is intended to be run after other Segtools commands. It searches
the local directory (or provided with ``--results-dir``) for ``div``
files produced by the other Segtools commands and compiles the data into an 
HTML report for review.

The ``SEGMENTATION`` argument and ``--mnemonic-file`` option 
should be the same as used to run the other Segtools commands.



.. ####################### LABEL TRANSITION #######################

.. _segtools-transition:

segtools-transition
-------------------

.. program:: segtools-transition

**segtools-transition [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION**

This command takes a segmentation and looks at the transitions between
segment labels. In other words, if a segment with label A is directly
adjacent to a segment with label B, this is counted as one A->B transition.
This command is thus most useful for segmentations that are a partition of
large regions or the whole genome. If your segmentation is just a set of
peak calls or regions of interest, it is unlikely that
there are many pairs of directly adjacent segments, and the results will
be meaningless.

As output, this command generates a heatmap of transition frequencies as
well as a graph interpretation of this heatmap. In many cases, there will be
at least one transition between every pair of segment labels, making
the transition graph fully connect. This can make it hard to interpret,
so the transition frequencies can be thresholded by value
(``--prob-threshold``) or quantile (``--quantile-threshold``) 
in drawing the graph.



.. ####################### LENGTH DISTRIBUTION #######################

.. _segtools-length-distribution:

segtools-length-distribution
----------------------------

.. program:: segtools-length-distribution

**segtools-length-distribution [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION**

This command summarizes the distribution of segment lengths, by label.
It generates a violin plot (a box plot, but instead of a box, it is a
smoothed density curve), a simple bar chart that describes the overall
label composition of the segmentation, and a table with useful information
such as the number of segments of each label, the mean and median segment
lengths, and the number of bases covered by each label.

.. note::
   This command requires only a segmentation as a parameter and performs
   minimal computation. As such, it is a useful test to make sure Segtools
   works on your system.

.. warning::
   Since the violin plot is based upon a density distribution, the lengths
   of all the segments in the segmentation is saved in a tab file to allow
   this plot to be regenerated solely from R. Unfortunately, for large
   segmentations, this tab file can get very large (hundreds of megabytes).
   We hope to revise this by saving instead a histogram-like summary of the
   segment lengths instead of a separate length for each segment.



.. ####################### NUCLEOTIDE FREQUENCY #######################

.. _segtools-nucleotide-frequency:

segtools-nucleotide-frequency
-----------------------------

.. program:: segtools-nucleotide-frequency

**segtools-nucleotide-frequency [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION GENOMEDATAFILE**

This command generates a heatmap of the normalized dinucleotide frequencies
found across segments of each label, as well as table of such nucleotide and
dinucleotide frequencies. CpG content is likely the most interesting output,
but nucleotide frequencies can be informative as well.

As input, it takes a segmentation and a Genomedata_
archive for the genome the segmentation covers. The Genomedata archive is used
solely for the nucleotide sequence. 



.. ####################### OVERLAP #######################

.. _segtools-overlap:

segtools-overlap
----------------

.. program:: segtools-overlap

**segtools-overlap [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION ANNOTATIONS**

This command measures the base-wise or segment-wise overlap between segments
in a segmentation and other annotations. Segments are classified by
their label and annotations can be classified with a group, so the basic
output is a confusion matrix with each cell representing the amount of overlap
between segments in one label with annotations in one group. Further, the
ability of each segment label to predict each annotation group is measured
and summarized in a precision-recall plot.

**Selected options**:

.. cmdoption:: --by <mode>, -b <mode>

   This specifies whether the overlap analysis will be base-wise
   (``<mode> = "bases"``) or segment-wise (``<mode> = "segments"``). 

.. cmdoption:: --min-overlap <n>

   This specifies the minimum number of bases that a segment and an annotation
   must overlap for that overlap to be counted. This number can be positive or
   negative, with ``<n> = 1`` indicating that the segment and annotation must
   overlap by at least one base, a ``<n> = 0`` indicating that they can be
   directly adjacent, and ``<n> = -1`` indicating that there can be one base
   separation for them to still count as overlapping.

.. warning::
   The precision-recall plot is accurate for base-wise overlap, but is a rough
   approximation for segment-wise overlap. Use such results with caution.



.. ####################### SIGNAL DISTRIBUTION #######################

.. _segtools-signal-distribution:

segtools-signal-distribution
----------------------------

.. program:: segtools-signal-distribution

**segtools-signal-distribution [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION GENOMEDATAFILE**

This command takes a segmentation and a Genomedata_ archive and summarizes
the distribution of values for each Genomedata track that fall within
segments of each label. Essentially, it generates a histogram for each
label-track pair, where the values being measured are the values for that 
track found in segments of that label. Currently, Segtools no longer
generates this matrix of histograms, but instead generates a heatmap
of mean and standard deviation values.

.. warning::
   Mean and standard deviation values are approximated from a histogram
   (binned) representation of the data. The effect should be minimal, but
   it is important to keep this in mind as a potential source of error.


**Parallelization**:

Depending upon the segmentation and the Genomedata archive, this command can
take a very long time to run. To help speed it up, you can parallelize the
command by chromosome. To do this, you would first submit a job for each
chromosome that doesn't plot anything. Then, you merge the results and generate
the final output. Here is sample pseudocode::

  indirs = []
  for <chrom> in <chroms>
    outdir = sub_<chrom>
    submit_job --name=<run_id> segtools-signal-distribution --noplot --chrom=<chrom> --outdir=<outdir>
    indirs.add("--indir=" + <outdir>)

  submit_job --hold_on=<run_id> segtools-signal-distribution --indirs=<indirs>


**Selected options**:

.. cmdoption:: --chrom <chrom>, -c <chrom>

   This restricts the analysis to the single chromosome specified
   and is useful in parallelizing this command. ``<chrom>`` must
   exactly match a chromosome in the Genomedata archive
   (``genome[<chrom>]`` must be valid).

.. cmdoption:: --create-mnemonics

   This uses the hierarchically-clustered heatmap of mean values to generate
   mnemonics for the segmentation labels. The mnemonic labels are of the
   form: ``X.Y``, where ``X`` is the group number and ``Y`` is the
   index in that group.

.. cmdoption:: --indir <dir>, -i <dir>

   This loads data from the output directory of a previous run of this
   command. This option can be specified multiple times, making it
   useful for parallelizing this command since multiple results can
   be merged together to generate the final output.


.. _`mnemonic file`:

Mnemonics
=========

Mnemonic files are supported by most of the Segtools commands and provide
a way to rename and reorder the displayed labels without repeating
the full analysis. Mnemonic files must be two or three tab-separated 
columns and must contain start with the following header 
(the description column is optional)::

  old{TAB}new[{TAB}description]

**Renaming**:

Each line of the mnemonic file specifies a mapping from the "old"
name (the one appearing in the segmentation file) to the "new" name
(the one to be displayed). Since the new name must fit into small spaces
in plots (such as axis labels), it is recommended for this field to be
a few characters (such as "I" for insulator). Longer descriptions can
be specified in the description column.

**Reordering**:

The order of the lines in the mnemonic file determines the order
the labels will be shown in plots.

**Example**:

If the segmentation file contains segments with labels of ``A``, ``B``,
and ``C``, but realized you wanted ``A`` to be displayed as ``A1``,
``C`` to be displayed as ``A2``, and the two of them to be next to
each other in plots, you should construct the following mnemonic file::

  old	new
  A	A1
  C	A2
  B	B

Including the B line is not necessary, but it makes it easier to
reorder the labels later (for instance, if you want B to come first).
A description column could also have been included. This file should be
saved as something like ``second_try.mnemonics`` and should be passed
into Segtools commands with ``--mnemonic-file=/path/to/second_try.mnemonics``.

If you had previously run Segtools commands on the segmentation before
creating these mnemonics, you could speed up the plot corrections by 
using the command's ``--replot`` option (all other options and
arguments should still be specified to ensure correctness).
