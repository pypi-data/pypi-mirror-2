Description: rjm.recipe.venv
        ===============
        
        This is a simple zc.buildout recipe that will use the virtualenv
        package to turn the buildout root into a sandboxed virtual python
        environment.  It is especially useful in conjunction with
        gp.recipe.pip, which can then be used to install python packages into
        the virtualenv that has been created.
        
        
        Supported Options
        =================
        
        venv_options:
        
        Extra options that will be used when the virtualenv command is
        invoked.  These should match exactly what would be used on a
        command line.
        
        distutils_urls:
        
        This option can be set to a list of URLs, each of which should
        point to an archive (tarball, zip, etc.) of a python package which
        supports simple distutils installation (i.e. 'python setup.py
        install').  Each of these packages will be installed into the
        virtualenv sandbox.  This is useful for installing certain older
        packages that do not work with pip, such as egenix-mx-base.
        
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        This is a very simple buildout file that creates a virtualenv with no
        site packages and using distribute.  It then installs egenix-mx-base
        using distutils, and the latest version of Pylons and all of its
        dependencies using pip::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        venv
        pip
        
        [venv]
        recipe = rjm.recipe.venv
        venv_options = --no-site-packages --with-distribute
        distutils_urls =
        http://downloads.egenix.com/python/egenix-mx-base-3.1.2.tar.gz
        
        [pip]
        recipe = gp.recipe.pip
        virtualenv = ${buildout:directory}
        install = pylons
