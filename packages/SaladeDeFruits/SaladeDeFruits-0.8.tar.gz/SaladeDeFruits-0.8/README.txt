SaladeDeFruit is a WSGI middleware mostly inspired from Deliverance_.

.. _deliverance: http://deliverance.openplans.org/

The main difference is that there is no proxy and no xml configuration needed.
All skinning stuff is done in python code with PyQuery_.

The name "SaladeDeFruit" came from an old french song_ from the famous
actor/singer Bourvil. Because SaladeDeFruit make your app "jolie jolie".

But, hey, please, don't use me if you need proxy. Deliverance still rocks !
