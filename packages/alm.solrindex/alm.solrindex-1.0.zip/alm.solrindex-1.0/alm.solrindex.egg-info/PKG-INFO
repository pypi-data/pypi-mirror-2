        SolrIndex is a product for Plone/Zope that provides enhanced searching capabilities by leveraging Solr, the popular open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project.
        
        Out of the box, SolrIndex brings in more relevant search results by replacing Plone's default full-text indexing with Solr-based search features, and including the ability to assign weights to certain fields.
        
        Leveraging Solr's advanced search algorithms, SolrIndex comes with exciting features, such as the ability to use stopwords and synonyms. Stopwords allow to control which words the search mechanism should ignore, and synonyms make it possible to extend a query by including additional matches.
        
        SolrIndex also comes with blazing fast and highly scalable search capabilities. SolrIndex is extensible by design, which means it has the ability to integrate with other indexes and catalogs. This is good news for sites that need to provide search capabilities across multiple repositories.
        
        With additional customization, SolrIndex also has the ability to provide faceted search, highlighting of query terms, spelling suggestions and "more like this" suggestions.
        
        Thanks to SolrIndex, Plone and Zope-powered sites now benefit from truly enterprise search capabilities.

        Special Thanks
        ==============
        
        Six Feet Up would especially like to thank Shane Hathaway for his key contribution to  SolrIndex.
        
        
        Detailed Documentation
        ======================
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Include this package in your Zope 2 or Plone buildout. If you are using
        the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` recipe, add ``alm.solrindex`` to the
        ``eggs`` parameter and the ``zcml`` parameter. See the ``buildout.cfg``
        in this package for an example. The example also shows how to use the
        ``collective.recipe.solrinstance`` recipe to build a working Solr
        instance with little extra effort.
        
        Once Zope is running with this package installed, you can visit a
        ZCatalog and add ``SolrIndex`` as an index. You should only add one
        SolrIndex to a ZCatalog, but a single SolrIndex can take the place of
        multiple ZCatalog indexes.
        
        
        The Solr Schema
        ---------------
        
        Configure the Solr schema to store an integer unique key.  Add fields
        with names matching the attributes of objects you want to index in Solr.
        You should avoid creating a Solr field that will index the same data
        as what will be indexed in ZODB by another ZCatalog index.  In other
        words, if you add a ``Description`` field to Solr, you probably ought
        to remove the index named ``Description`` from ZCatalog, so that you
        don't force your system to index descriptions twice.
        
        Once the SolrIndex is installed, you can query all of the fields
        described by the Solr schema, even if there is no ZCatalog index with
        a matching name.  For example, if you have configured a ``Description``
        field in the Solr schema, then you can issue catalog queries against
        the ``Description`` field using the same syntax you would use with
        other ZCatalog indexes.  For example::
        
        results = portal.portal_catalog(Description={'query': 'waldo'})
        
        Queries of this form pass through a configurable translation layer made
        of field handler objects. When you need more flexibility than the field
        handlers provide, you can either write your own field handlers (see the
        "Writing Your Own Field Handlers" section) or you can provide Solr
        parameters that do not get translated (see the "Translucent Solr
        Queries" section).
        
        
        Translucent Solr Queries
        ------------------------
        
        You can issue a Solr query through a ZCatalog containing a SolrIndex by
        providing a ``solr_params`` dictionary in the ZCatalog query. For
        example, if you have a SolrIndex installed in portal_catalog, this call
        will query Solr::
        
        results = portal.portal_catalog(solr_params={'q': 'waldo'})
        
        The SolrIndex in the catalog will issue the query parameters specified
        in ``solr_params`` to Solr. Each parameter value can be a string
        (including unicode) or a list of strings. If you provide query
        parameters for other Solr fields, the parameters passed to Solr will be
        mixed with parameters generated for the other fields.  Note that Solr
        requires some value for the '``q``' parameter, so if you provide Solr
        parameters but no value for '``q``', SolrIndex will supply '``*:*``' as the
        value for '``q``'.
        
        Solr will return to the SolrIndex a list of matching document IDs and
        scores, then the SolrIndex will pass the document IDs and scores to
        ZCatalog, then ZCatalog will intersect the document IDs with results
        from other indexes. Finally, ZCatalog will return a sorted list of
        result objects ("brain" objects) to application code.
        
        If you need access to the Solr response object, provide a
        ``solr_callback`` function in the catalog query. After Solr sends its
        response, the SolrIndex will call the callback function with the parsed
        Solr response object. The response object conforms with the
        documentation of the ``solrpy`` package.
        
        
        Sorting
        -------
        
        SolrIndex only provides document IDs and scores, while ZCatalog retains
        the responsibility for sorting the results. To sort the results from a
        query involving SolrIndex, use the ``sort_on`` parameter like you
        normally would with ZCatalog. At this time, you can not use a SolrIndex
        as the index to sort on, but that could change in the future.
        
        
        Writing Your Own Field Handlers
        -------------------------------
        
        Field handlers serve two functions. They parse object attributes for
        indexing, and they translate field-specific catalog queries to Solr
        queries. They are registered as utilities, so you can write your own
        handlers and register them using ZCML.
        
        To determine the field handler for a Solr field, ``alm.solrindex`` first
        looks for an ``ISolrFieldHandler`` utility with a name matching the field
        name. If it doesn't find one, it looks for an ``ISolrFieldHandler`` utility
        with a name matching the name of the Java class that handles the field
        in Solr. If that also fails, it retrieves the ``ISolrFieldHandler`` with no
        name.
        
        See the documentation of the ``ISolrFieldHandler`` interface and the examples
        in handlers.py.
        
        
        Integration with ZCatalog
        -------------------------
        
        One ``SolrIndex`` can take the place of several ZCatalog indexes. In
        theory, you could replace all of the catalog indexes with just a single
        ``SolrIndex``. Don't do that yet, though, because this package needs
        more maturity before it's ready to take on that many responsibilities.
        
        Furthermore, replacing all ZCatalog indexes might not be the right
        goal. ZCatalog indexes are under appreciated. ZCatalog indexes are built
        on the excellent transaction-aware object cache provided by ZODB. This
        gives them certain inherent performance advantages over network bound
        search engines like Solr. Any communication with Solr incurs a delay on
        the order of a millisecond, while a ZCatalog index can often answer a
        query in a few microseconds. ZCatalog indexes also simplify cluster
        design. The ZODB cache allows cluster nodes to perform searches without
        relying on a large central search engine.
        
        Where ZCatalog indexes currently fall short, however, is in the realm
        of indexing text. None of the text indexes available for ZCatalog match
        the features and performance of text search engines like Solr.
        
        Therefore, one good way to use this package is to move all text indexes
        to Solr. That way, queries that don't need the text engine will avoid
        the expense of invoking Solr. You can also move other kinds of indexes
        to Solr.
        
        
        How This Package Maintains Persistent Connections
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        This package uses a new method of maintaining an external database
        connection from a ZODB object. Previous approaches included storing
        ``_v_`` (volatile) attributes, keeping connections in a thread local
        variable, and reusing the multi-database support inside ZODB, but
        those approaches each have significant drawbacks.
        
        The new method is to add dictionary called ``foreign_connections`` to
        the ZODB Connection object (the ``_p_jar`` attribute of any persisted
        object). Each key in the dictionary is the OID of the object that needs
        to maintain a persistent connection. Each value is an
        implementation-dependent database connection or connection wrapper. If
        it is possible to write to the external database, the database
        connection or connection wrapper should implement the ``IDataManager``
        interface so that it can be included in transaction commit or abort.
        
        When a SolrIndex needs a connection to Solr, it first looks in the
        ``foreign_connections`` dictionary to see if a connection has already
        been made. If no connection has been made, the SolrIndex makes the
        connection immediately. Each ZODB connection has its own
        ``foreign_connections`` attribute, so database connections are not
        shared by concurrent threads, making this a thread safe solution.
        
        This solution is better than ``_v_`` attributes because connections will
        not be dropped due to ordinary object deactivation. This solution is
        better than thread local variables because it allows the object
        database to hold any number of external connections and it does not
        break when you pass control between threads. This solution is better
        than using multi-database support because participants in a
        multi-database are required to fulfill a complex contract that is
        irrelevant to databases other than ZODB.
        
        Other packages that maintain an external database connection should try
        out this scheme to see if it improves reliability or readability. Other
        packages should use the same ZODB Connection attribute name,
        ``foreign_connections``, which should not cause any clashes, since
        OIDs can not be shared.
        
        An implementation note: when ZODB objects are first created, they are
        not stored in any database, so there is no simple way for the object to
        get a ``foreign_connections`` dictionary. During that time, one way to hold
        a database connection is to temporarily fall back to the volatile
        attribute solution. That is what SolrIndex does (see the ``_v_temp_cm``
        attribute).
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If the Solr index is preventing you from accessing Zope for some reason,
        you can set ``DISABLE_SOLR=YES`` in the environment, causing the SolrIndex
        class to bypass Solr for all queries and updates.

        0.9 (2009-10-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed test failure by going to the login_form to log in, instead of
        the front page, where we get ambiguity errors.
        [maurits]
        
        - Fixed the catalog object information page.  Solr was unable to parse
        a negative number in the query.
        
        
        0.8 (2009-09-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for Solr boolean fields.
        
        - GenericSetup profiles now have the option of clearing the
        index.
        
        - Made the waituri script wait up to 90 seconds by default,
        pause a little more between polls, and accept a timeout
        parameter.
        
        0.7 (2009-09-13)
        ----------------
        
        - The Solr URI can now be provided by an environment variable,

        ----------------
        
        - Added narrative documentation.
        
        - Don't clear the index when running GenericSetup.  Clearing
        indexes turns out to be a long-standing problem with GenericSetup;
        in this case the easy solution is to just not clear it.
        
        0.5 (2009-09-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Added a script that waits for Solr to start up.
        
        - Brought in a private copy of solrpy to fix some bugs:
        
        - The connection retry code reconnected, but wasn't
        actually retrying the request.
        
        - The raw_query method should not assume the parameter
        values are unicode (they could be lists of unicode).
        
        0.4 (2009-09-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Purge Solr when importing a SolrIndex via GenericSetup.
        
        0.3 (2009-09-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Made field handlers more flexible.  Now they can add any
        kind of query parameter to the Solr query.
        
        - The default field handler now generates "fq" parameters
        instead of "q" parameters.  This seems to fit the intent of
        the Solr authors much better.
        
        - Renamed "solr_additional" to "solr_params".
        
        0.2 (2009-09-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Added a GenericSetup profile that replaces SearchableText
        with a SolrIndex.
        
        - Renamed the catalog parameter for passing extra args to Solr
        "solr_additional".  Also renamed the response callback
        parameter to "solr_callback".
        
        0.1 (2009-09-09)
        ----------------
