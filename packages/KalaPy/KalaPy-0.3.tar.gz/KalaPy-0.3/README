KalaPy
===============================================================================

KalaPy is a web application framework for Python providing it’s own Database
Abstraction Layer, web components based on Werkzeug, templating using powerful
Jinja2 template engine and full internationalization support via Babel and pytz
and more...

The development is still under alpha stage and API might change during this
period. I welcome your useful suggestions/thoughts about how to improve it and
how it should look like.

At the moment it looks some what similar to Django, but it is only so to get
started quickly. The intention is to implement a framework that combines power
of OpenObject and Django. Let’s see how it goes...

TODO

* Write more unit tests
* Improve documentation
* Support for OpenERP
* Packages (modular design)
    - Per package settings file
    - Support for extending an existing package with addon packages
    - Resources provided by an addon package should get preference over
      original package
* Widget framework
    - Form generation and validation
    - Generic view generation (non-form widgets)
    - Declarative view definitions for data models
* Admin interface
