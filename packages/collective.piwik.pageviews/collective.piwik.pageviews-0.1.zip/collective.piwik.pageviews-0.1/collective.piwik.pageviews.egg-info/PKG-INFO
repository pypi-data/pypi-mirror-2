Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.piwik.pageviews is a viewlet displaying page views, using Piwik!
        
        The Piwik open source analytics system (http://piwik.org/) is used to store and retrieve the page views.
        
        Works with Plone 4 sites, not tested on Plone 3. 
        
        How to get it working
        =====================
        
         - You need to have access to a working Piwik installation. Anonymous users should have view permission for your site's stats.
        
         - Add the Piwik Tracking Tag to Javascript web stats support field at <SITEURL>/@@site-controlpanel
        
         - You need to make a small change adding the link "var site_id = X;", replacing X with your Piwik site_id
           For example, if on the Piwik code you have:
           var piwikTracker = Piwik.getTracker(pkBaseURL + "piwik.php", 6);
           then site_id = 6 in your case
        
        
        If you do the above steps a viewlet should appear bellow IBelowContent displaying the number of views of a page (both unique and pagehits).

        TODO
        ====
        
         - Redesign architecture in flavor of security. Right now anonymous user access has to be granted on piwik which is not a good idea...
