js.jquery_qunit
***************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery QUnit`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery QUnit`: http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_qunit``) are published to some URL.
