Description: lpdistutils
        ===========
        
        This is a set of extra commands for distutils/setuptools that allow working with
        Launchpad and Bazaar. They are similar to the "register" and "upload" commands
        provided by distutils for working with pypi.
        
        Commands
        --------
        
          * lpregister - register the project on Launchpad. This takes the information from
            setup.py and creates you a Launchpad project based on that information.
        
            In addition, if you are working in a bzr branch then that branch will be pushed
            to Launchpad, and set as the development focus of the new project.
        
          * lpupload - this uploads a release to Launchpad for you. Similar to the "upload"
            command you run it with the command to build the artefact you wish to upload, e.g.::
        
              python setup.py --command-packages lpdistutils  sdist lpupload --sign
        
            If you wish to upload to PYPI too you can do this with::
        
              python setup.py --command-packages sdist upload --sign lpupload --use-existing-sig
        
          * bzrtag - this sets a bzr tag based on the version number in setup.py, so you
            can use it as part of your release process.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You need to tell distutils/setuptools to load the commands provided by lpdistutils, and
        you do this with the --command-packages option to setup.py.
        
        ::
        
          python setup.py --command-packaegs lpdistutils
        
        This must be the first thing passed.
        
        It is possible to enable it in the `distutils config files`_
        
        .. _distutils config files: http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#distutils-configuration-files
        
        like::
        
        [global]
        command-packages = lpdistutils
