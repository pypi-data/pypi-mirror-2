Description: Description
        
        This product is an add-on to Raphael Ritz's CMFBibliographyAT.
        
        It is used by ATBiblioList and ATBiblioTopic to format the display of
        bibliography references listings (biblio smart folders and biblio lists
        contents) in pre formatted ways, or by using custom designed styles created
        by portal users.
        
        It should not be too difficult for a python programmer to write its own
        file system based bibliography styles. If you do so, please share your
        interesting bibliography styles with the community.
