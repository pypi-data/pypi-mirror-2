        ======
        
        A suite of command-line utilities implementing basic geometric operations. (Difference, Intersection, etc.)
        
        This project is a cousin of `csvkit <http://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit>`_.
        
        **Note: This is only a proof-of-concept to see if this idea makes sense.**
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        It's easy!
        
        ::
        
        pip install ogrkit
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To try the difference utility::
        
        ./ogrdifference INPUT_SHAPEFILE OUTPUT_SHAPEFILE [MASK_SHAPEFILES...]
        
        Note: this currently only works with shapefiles, but could be extended to work with any format supported by `OGR <http:/www.gdal.org/>`_.
