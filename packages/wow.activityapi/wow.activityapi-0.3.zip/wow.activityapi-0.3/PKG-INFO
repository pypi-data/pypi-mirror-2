        Introduction
        ============
        
        The activity-API reads the character-activity-sheet from the Armory to get the five last actions of the character.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To use the API, just do an import like this
        
        ::
        
            >>> from activity_api import Activity
        
        Mock Realmstatus.get_realm_status
        Returns output similar to what we would get from the API,  so
        that this test can be used while offline
        
        ::
        
            >>> from test_activity import mocked_get_activity
        
        Mocking the functions
        
        ::
        
            >>> Activity.get_activity = mocked_get_activity
        
        First create an instance of the Activity object
        
        ::
        
            >>> activity = Activity()
        
        To get the recent activities, use get_activity(name, realm, zone)
        
        ::
        
            >>> activities = activity.get_activity("Kutschurft", "Azshara", "EU")
            >>> test_activities = [u'Earned the achievement [Neck-Deep in Vile (10 player)].',
            ...                    u'Has now completed [Victories over the Lich King (Icecrown 10 player)] 4 times.',
            ...                    u'Has now completed [Sindragosa kills (Heroic Icecrown 10 player)] 2 times.',
            ...                    u'Has now completed [Valithria Dreamwalker rescues (Heroic Icecrown 10 player)] 4 times.',
            ...                    u'Has now completed [Blood Queen Lanathel kills (Heroic Icecrown 10 player)] 6 times.']
        
            >>> activities == test_activities
            True
