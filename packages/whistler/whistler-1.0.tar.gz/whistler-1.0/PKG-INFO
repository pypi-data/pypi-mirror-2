        Whistler Bot
        ============
        
        Whistler Bot is an XMPP bot written in python using pyxmpp, which is
        a requirement. The bot is designed to handle some commands, and it's easy to
        extend.
        
        Simple usage::
        
            from whistler.bot import WhistlerBot
        
            bot = WhistlerBot( "myjid@myserver.com", "mypassword" )
            bot.start()
        
        The provided console script called ``whistler`` is a single bot which reply
        to a ``!ping`` command.
        
        
        Extending bot
        -------------
        
        You can extend the bot functionalities, just see for example the code of the
        whistler console script. In short you can add commands creating a new class
        from WhistlerBot, and define new functions in the form *cmd_* plus the
        command name, for example, to handle the command *ping*::
        
            from whistler.bot import WhistlerBot
        
            class MyBot(WhistlerBot):
        
                def cmd_ping(self, msg, args):
                    return "pong"
