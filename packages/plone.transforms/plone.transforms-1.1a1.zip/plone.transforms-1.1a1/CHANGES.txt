1.0a3 - 2010-01-23
------------------

- Defined tmfilepath outside try: to make finally: clause not fail.
  [martior]

1.0a2 - 2008-05-21
------------------

- Use the new arguments flexibility to extend the pdf_to_html command
  transform with a `output_image_format` option. This controls the format
  of the extracted images. It defaults to `png16m` and can be changed to
  any value supported by `gs -h`, for example `jpeg`.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the signature of prepare_transform. It has a general arguments
  argument now, instead of one hardcoded infile_data_suffix argument.
  This allows transforms to push arbitrary arguments down to the actual
  command line.
  [hannosch]

- Updated image transforms. Allow resizing with only one size argument.
  The other one will be calculated to keep the aspect ratio. Also guarded
  against errors when trying to use transparency on PNG images in modes
  which do not support it.
  [hannosch]

- Guard against empty input in pdf_html transform.
  [hannosch]

- We do want to preserve image transparency; because it's so cool!

1.0a1 - 2008-02-11
------------------

- Removed the unfinished engine configuration which had a Zope2 dependency.
  [hannosch]

- Added both the input_mimetype and output_mimetype values provided to the
  transform method of the engine to the options dictionary which is passed
  on to the individual transforms.

  For example multimedia transforms which can handle different formats can
  be implemented as single transforms this way, without having to guess the
  input format again.

  The output_mimetype can be useful in optimizing the transform result
  when a transform is used in a transform chain and the output format of
  the current transform is not the desired end result.

- Initial design and work. Lots of work has been done on the Pastisprint
  in Aix-en-Provence in August 2007. Thx to atReal and Thierry Benita for
  organizing it and his whole family for hosting us.

  Special thanks to 'Focus-man' and his special powers which let us focus
  on the work ;)

  Also thanks to Google for its Summer of Code project which sponsored
  hannosch for his work.

  Kudos to Benjamin Saller, Sidnei da Silva and Sylvain Thenault for the
  PortalTransforms product which this work has been heavily based upon.
