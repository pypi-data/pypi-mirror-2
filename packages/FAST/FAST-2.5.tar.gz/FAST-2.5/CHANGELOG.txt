FAST CHANGELOG
==============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Bugfix for case where gcov tosses errors that are not related to
  locating the original source file (introduced in r2378, references
  #3860).

- gcovr now detects if gcov tosses any errors and tries re-running gcov
  from higher in the directory tree. This should fix #3860.

- gcovr: adding support for excluding files based on a regex anchored at
  the root (or filter) in addition to the absolute path.

- Bug fix in path testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Renamed the '--opt' option to '--option'

- Added further detail to the svnem status summary

- Update FAST to use the renamed pyutilib.plugin.* packages

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Adding 'driver' script, which is called from the Acro top-level 'setup'
  script to control the configuration and build of Acro software.

- Added logic to support 'svnem' status, which summarizes which subversion 
  projects have commits that need to be integrated into a release branch.

- Added support for sorting text output in gcovr by the percentage of
  uncovered lines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added the 'svnem' utility, which parses subversion repositories and
  summarizes key statistics and relationships (e.g. external dependencies)

- Removed slow EXACT tests.

- Updated to use PyUtilib's run_command utility instead of SubprocessMngr.

- Various changes due to PyUtilib reorganization.

- Disabled example18, which depends on 'memmon'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Augmented the `gcovr` script to generate Cobertura XML output.

- Misc update to track changes in PyUtilib

- Resolved portability issues for Python 3.0

- Augmented EXACT to generate xUnit XML reports

- Misc updates to the update_externals command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAST has recently evolved to (a) integrate elements of Coopr that relate
to software testing and experimental design, and (b) rework the test
harness management tools to support a Pythonic implementation.

NOTE: several directories are not pythonic: server, client and codechecks.  At least, not yet...

NOTE: This package was integrated with the Coopr Python package for a while.
However, it was subsequently extracted into a separate Python package.

- Created the update_externals command, which is used to update subversion
  externals in the Acro project.

- Moved the EXACT Python package into FAST.

- Reworked the `exact` script to use the Python optparse package for
  command-line processing.

- Extracted the guts of the `exact` script, which are integrated into
  the FAST Python package.  This allows this capability to be applied 
  within other scripts.

- Added unit tests for EXACT.

- Created the svn_check script to test externals in a subversion repository.

- For a while, pyfast was the name of the Python FAST package.  This was 
  depricated and FAST was used instead.

- Python scripts in fast/client have been migrated into fast/scripts.  Other
  scripts in fast/client will eventually be migrated to Python to simplify
  the maintenance of FAST.

- Added the `gcovr` script, which provides a gcov summary report.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FAST 1.1 (09/30/2007)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changed heading for Analysis Results table; it no longer shows only
  Analysis Failures.

- Update to cron_script to use a more portable check of
  error status.

- Revised db_summary to
  -  print links to all studies' XML and results.XML files.
  -  print (in red) study names for studies that failed to generate analysis XML
     files.

- Add testing for gtar.

- Revised db_summary to pritn links to all studies' XML and results.XML files,
  and print (in red) study names for studies that failed to generate analysis
  XML files.

- More portable check of error status in cron_script.

- Adding exit codes and message when cvs errors occur

- Update of externals checking

  Only check if links exist for releases.  Updated
  links are not relevant.

  Only check if updated links exist of the _latest_
  stable branch.  Links in older stable branches
  probably shouldn't be changed.

- Adding a summary tool for open bugs organized by component.

- Adding a '--components' flag to openbugs, which
  generates a component-wise summary (rather than a severity-wise
  summary).

- Perform error checking while processing the commands handed to the
  driver.  If any command generates an error, abort the rest of the
  errors.

- Misc bug fix ... checking to verify that there exists a tag/release/stable
  branch, which may be missing even though the tag/release/stable
  directory exists.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 FAST 1.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Initial release.
