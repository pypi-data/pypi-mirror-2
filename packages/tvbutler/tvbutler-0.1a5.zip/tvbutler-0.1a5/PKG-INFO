Description: tvbutler reads RSS feeds from http://tvtorrents.com and downloads torrents of new episodes for you in your preferred quality (but is smart enough to fallback to non-HD versions, if available).
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``tvbutler`` is designed to work as a ``crontab`` or ``launchd`` entry: called without any parameters it will download all given feeds, try to identify shows and then figure out which episodes are available in which quality.
        
        It then downloads the torrent files into the given target directory (which typically will be 'watched' by a torrent client).
        
        tvbutler keeps a log of its activities in `~/.tvbutler/log` and a (sqlite) database of known shows and episodes in `~/.tvbutler/database.db`
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The configuration lives in `~/.tvbutler/config`, the installer places a sample configuration and should be pretty self-explanatory::
        
          [main]
          download_dir=~/Downloads/
          # one of sd, 720p, 1080p
          preferred_quality=720p
          
          # one per line, indented
          feeds =
              http://www.tvtorrents.com/mytaggedRSS?digest=xxxxx
              http://www.tvtorrents.com/mydownloadRSS?digest=xxxx
        
        Since tvbutler is aimed at downloading new episodes of currently running shows as they are released, it excludes by default all torrents it recognizes as archives of entire seasons. It does so by excluding all torrents whose description matches a regular expression, which is configurable via the config file::
        
          global_exclude_regex=(all.month|month.of|season[\s\d]*complete)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just install `easy_install` like so::
        
          easy_install tvbutler
        
        Alternatively, download the archive, expand it and run::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        This will install the command line executable ``tvbutler`` mentioned above. 
        
        TODO
        ====
        
         * archive or delete files older than `n` days (perhaps base decision on tag)
         * remove torrents from transmission that have reached their seeding limit
        
        0.1a5 - Unreleased
        ==================
        
        * log to stdout, too to get instant feedback when calling tvbutler from console
        * robustness fix (tvbutler would barf on some entries and stop processing the remaining entries)
        
        0.1a4 - 2010-12-08
        ==================
        
        * added global regular expression filter (defaults to skip archives of
          seasons)
        
          `UPGRADE NOTE`: add ``global_exclude_regex=(all.month|month.of|season[\s\d]*complete)``
          to the ``[main]`` section your existing config to activate this feature.
        
        0.1a3 - 2010-12-05
        ==================
        
        * added logging
        
        
        0.1a2 - 2010-12-05
        ==================
        
        Initial release (0.1a was nuked due to packaging foobar)
