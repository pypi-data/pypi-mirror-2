Description: odls.client -- A client for the OpenDataLinkingSystem (ODLS_)
        *************************************************************
        
        The ODLS_ client scans local filesystems, looks for changes, and reports
        them to an ODLS_ server. The states of files/directories scanned are
        stored in a local SQLite database.
        
        The `odls.client` package mainly provides a script ``indexer`` that
        will be available in some ``bin/`` directory after install (the
        concrete location will depend on the type of install).
        
        The ``indexer`` script is configured by commandline options (try
        ``indexer --help``) and configuration files. All this is explained in
        more detail in the package documentation (see below).
        
        This Python implementation of the ODLS_ client is the successor of the
        C++ implementation used in the years before.
        
        While `odls.client` itself is pure Python, some extensions (notably
        the SQLite support) require C extensions.
        
        .. warning:: This package is in a really early state!!! Some options
        do simply not work yet and Windows support is yet
        completely untested.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The full package documentation can be found at:
        
        http://packages.python.org/odls.client
        
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        `odls.client` is currently tested on Linux only.
        
        * you need Python >= 2.4
        
        * you need `pysqlite` whih in turn might require the SQLite libraries
        and header files.
        
        * for full install (including tests etc.) you also need the Python
        header files and a working C-compiler like `gcc`.
        
        
        Installing the Library
        ======================
        
        Use `easy_install` to install the library.
        
        Or download the sources and in the root dir of the extracted package
        do::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        You might need superuser permissions to do that.
        
        
        Installing for Development
        ==========================
        
        After downloading and extracting the sources, in the root dir of the
        downloaded file tree do::
        
        $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        which will configure the package for your system. Then, run::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        which will generate all scripts needed for development in the local
        ``bin/`` directory.
        
        Running Tests
        -------------
        
        Afterwards you can run the tests by doing::
        
        $ ./bin/test
        
        Creating Docs
        -------------
        
        `odls.client` comes with some documentation in the ``docs/``
        folder. It can be turned into `Sphinx` based HTML by running::
        
        $ ./bin/make-docs
        
        The docs then can be found in ``docs/build/html``.
        
        Creating Coverage Reports
        -------------------------
        
        We try to keep `odls.client` at a 100%-test-covered level. You can
        do the coverage report by issuing on the command line::
        
        $ ./bin/coverage-detect
        $ ./bin/coveragereport
        
        This will create HTML docs of the test coverage of each module. You
        can find the generated HTML pages in the ``coveragereport`` subdir.
