[CLIENT]


# You may specify several paths or files to observe. Observing a path
# means observing all files 'below' this path.  So *please* put not
# something like 'C:\' in here (You have been warned).

WATCH_FILES = 

# You may also specify folders to be observed. Observed folders
# (contrary to WATCH_FILES, of course) also detect new files added.

WATCH_FOLDERS= 

# You may specify here a list of filenames to be ignored. All
# filenames found during work ('filename' means: all except the path)
# are tried to match against each of the entries in this list and
# discarded when a match happens. This check is performed for files as
# well as directories, so be careful.  You can use asterisks and
# question marks as wildcards, where a question mark stands for any
# char, while asterisk matches a substring of any length including the
# empty string. Typical entries may be "*.ppt" or similar. Default is:
# empty list

WATCH_BLACKLIST=*~
  ~*


# How long to wait between to scan runs. Scanning lots of directories
# and files can cost a huge amount of time and ressources, so do not
# set too little values in here. Value given is interpreted in
# seconds. Default is 300 (5 minutes). Minimum is 10 seconds.

WATCH_UPDATETIME=300


# When we do not reach the server for any reason, it is possible to
# discard older change notifications (which meanwhile have not been
# deleted due to changed file status). This can help weak servers
# better to cope with the traffic jammed to it, when it starts
# working. Here you can say, how old a file change is allowed to be,
# before discarding it. Anyway, it should be safe to store even old
# file changes. If you want no discarding of old entries, say -1
# here, which is recommended. The time is understood as seconds.

WATCH_OLD_DISCARD=900


# It may be the case, that some request to update data on the server
# is refused by the server. This may happen due to too much traffic or
# similar reasons. We can try to repeat the request later on or forget
# about the file change indicated by that request, because chances
# are, that even later requests to process our data will fail. Hence,
# it might be reasonable to ignore (forget) ODLS-server failures and
# act like everything went fine. The log will notify such
# situations. Default is: yes.

WATCH_IGNORE_ODLS_FAILURE=yes


# When a module can not read a file or is not able to extract the data
# it contains, there is in most cases no sense in sending this
# (broken) information to the server. Anyway, you might be interested
# in the existance of such files and therefore say, that this (broken)
# information is of value for you and the server should be notified of
# the existance of such a file. Then you have to say "no"
# here. Normally we ignore unreadable files. Default is: yes

WATCH_IGNORE_UNREADABLE=yes


# From version 0.1.7 you can tell the indexer to send also the
# complete binaries to the server, to do backups, maintain archives or
# similar. Please consider, that this will cause a noteable increase
# of traffic sent to the server. Default is: yes

SEND_BINARIES=yes


# If you do not want keywords of documents (i.e.: meta information like
# author, creation date and other document type depending information),
# disable here. The network traffic generated by keywords generally is 
# calm. Default is: yes

SEND_KEYWORDS=yes


# If you want fulltext extractions of the documents parsed, choose yes
# here. This is one of the main tasks, odls_client was made for.
# Default is: yes

SEND_FULLTEXT=no


# If documents and their parsed output should be compressed before sent
# to the server, choose yes here. Only long documents are compressed
# using ZLIB. Such strings are sent, using a 'fulltext_compressed' entry
# instead of 'fulltext', or 'binary_compressed' instead of 'binary'.
# Default is: yes

SEND_COMPRESSED=yes


# From version 0.1.13 you can tell the indexer to encode all output to
# a certain character set encoding. This means, all *parsed* output,
# like document content output on commandline (using -i option) or
# content of documents sent to the ODLS server is of the specified
# encoding. You can specify a different encoding if it suits your
# needs. Anyway the value given here can be overriden on the
# commandline using the --env option.  Default is
# "iso-8859-15"

OUTPUT_ENCODING=ISO-8859-15


# Path to SQLite DB file where status is stored/read from.

[LOG]

# possible, you can specify other options below. You can also do
# several logs at the same time. Default is no.
