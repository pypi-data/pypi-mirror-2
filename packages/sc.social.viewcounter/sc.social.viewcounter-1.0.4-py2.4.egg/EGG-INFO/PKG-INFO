Description: sc.social.viewcounter
        =====================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        sc.social.viewcounter provides most accessed / viewed content ranking for Plone
        sites.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * SQLAlchemy 0.5
        
        * z3c.saconfig
        
        * pysqlite (used for testing)
        
        * A database connector
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First step prior to using sc.social.viewcounter is to add a zcml slug to provide a named session 'sc.social.viewcounter.db'. This could be done on the configure.zcml, but you must add the xmlns for db in the configure tag and also include z3c.saconfig into your product ::
        
        
        <configure
        ...
        xmlns:db="http://namespaces.zope.org/db"
        ...>
        
        <include package="z3c.saconfig" file="meta.zcml"/>
        
        <db:engine name="sc.social.viewcounter.sqlmemory" url="sqlite:///:memory:" echo="True" />
        <db:session name="sc.social.viewcounter.db" engine="sc.social.viewcounter.sqlmemory" />
        
        </configure>
        
        
        Please refer to z3c.saconfig documentation on how to configure url connection strings for your databases.
        
        To enable this product, on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.social.viewcounter``
        to the list of eggs to install ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        sc.social.viewcounter
        
        2. Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        sc.social.viewcounter
        
        If another package depends on the sc.social.viewcounter egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
        in order to see the effects of the product installation.
