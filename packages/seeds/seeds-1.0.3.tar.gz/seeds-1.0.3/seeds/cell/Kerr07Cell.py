""" Cell type that represents bacteriocin-producing bacteria.  In this system,
cells can be either toxin producers, toxin resistant, or toxin sensitive.
Toxin producers produce a toxin that kills nearby sensitive cells.  This toxin
does not effect resistant or producer cells.

The costs of toxin resistance and production each manifest themselves as
increases in mortality.  Therefore, producers have the highest death rate,
followed by resistant cells, and finally sensitive cells.

This is a non-transitive system that can be compared with the
rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game, where each strategy beats one but is beaten by
another.  If any one strategy is lost, another strategy will also be lost, as
the non-transitivity is broken (if no one can play 'rock', 'scissors' will
always win the game).

    This is a Cell type inspired by the model presented in:

        B. Kerr, Bacteriocins: ecology and evolution. Springer, 2007

    and used in:

        B.D. Connelly, L. Zaman, C. Ofria, and P.K. McKinley,
        "Social structure and the maintenance of biodiversity," in
        Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on the Synthesis
        and Simulation of Living Systems (ALIFE), pp. 461-468, 2010.

    This Cell type has 4 states:
        EMPTY: no organism is in the cell
        SENSITIVE: cells sensitive to being killed by bacteriocin
        RESISTANT: cells insensitive to bacteriocin, but that do not
          produce it themselves.
        PRODUCER: cells that produce bacteriocin and are insensitive
          to it.

    The sensitivity of a SENSITIVE cell to bacteriocin depends on the
    number of PRODUCER cells in its neighborhood.


    Configuration: All configuration options should be specified in a
    Kerr07Cell block.

        death_sensitive: death rate of SENSITIVE cells (float, [0,1])
        death_resistant: death rate of RESISTANT cells (float, [0,1])
        death_producer: death rate of PRODUCER cells (float, [0,1])
        toxicity: The toxicity of PRODUCER cells (float, [0,1])

    Example:
        [Kerr07Cell]
        death_sensitive = 0.250
        death_resistant = 0.312
        death_producer = 0.333
