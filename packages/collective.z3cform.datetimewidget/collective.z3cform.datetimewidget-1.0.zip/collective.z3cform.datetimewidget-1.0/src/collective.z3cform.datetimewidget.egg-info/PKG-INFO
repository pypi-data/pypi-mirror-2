Description: Various z3c.form date and datetime widgets
        ==========================================
        
        Improved datetime widgets for z3c.form
        
        When the emphasis of the application you are designing is on speed and
        speed alone, then the single field pattern might be your friend. It's
        particularly useful for data entry applications in which the person
        who has to enter the data will have to use the same input form time
        and time again.

        The ``collective.z3cform.datetimewidget`` library provides a form framework
        and widgets. This document ensures that we implement a widget for Date and
        Datetime field defined in ``zope.schema``. Take a look at the different widget
        doctest files for more information about the widgets.

        "ValueError: year=99 is before 1900; the datetime strftime() methods require
        year >= 1900"
