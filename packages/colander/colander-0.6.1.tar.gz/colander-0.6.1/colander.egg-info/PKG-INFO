Description: Colander
        ========
        
        An extensible package which can be used to:
        
        - deserialize and validate a data structure composed of strings,
        mappings, and lists.
        
        - serialize an arbitrary data structure to a data structure composed
        of strings, mappings, and lists.
        
        Please see `http://docs.repoze.org/colander
        <http://docs.repoze.org/colander>`_ for further documentation.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.6.1 (2010-05-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Add a Decimal type (number type which uses ``decimal.Decimal`` as a
        deserialization target).
        
        0.6.0 (2010-05-02)
        ------------------
        
        - (Hopefully) fix intermittent datetime-granularity-related test
        failures.
        
        - Internationalized error messages.  This required some changes to
        error message formatting, which may impact you if you were feeding
        colander an error message template.
        
        - New project dependency: ``translationstring`` package for
        internationalization.
        
        - New argument to ``colander.String`` constructor: ``allow_empty``.
        This is a boolean representing whether an empty string is a valid
        value during deserialization, defaulting to ``False``.
        
        - Add minimal documentation about the composition of a
        colander.Invalid exception to the narrative docs.
        
        - Add (existing, but previously non-API) colander.Invalid attributes
        to its interface within the API documentation.
        
        0.5.2 (2010-04-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Add Email and Regex validators (courtesy Steve Howe).
        
        - Raise a ``colander.Invalid`` error if a ``colander.SequenceSchema``
        is created with more than one member.
        
        - Add ``Function`` validator.
        
        - Fix bug in serialization of non-Unicode values in the ``String`` class.
        
        - Get rid of ``pserialize`` in favor of making ``serialize`` always
        partially serialize.
        
        - Get rid of ``pdeserialize``: it existed only for symmetry.  We'll
        add something like it back later if we need it.
        
        0.5.1 (2010-04-02)
        ------------------
        
        - The constructor arguments to a the ``colander.Schema`` class are now
        sent to the constructed SchemaNode rather than to the type it represents.
        
        - Allow ``colander.Date`` and ``colander.DateTime`` invalid error
        messages to be customized.
        
        - Add a ``pos`` argument to the ``colander.Invalid.add`` method.
        
        - Add a ``__setitem__`` method to the ``colander.Invalid`` class.
        
        - The ``colander.Mapping`` constructor keyword argument
        ``unknown_keys`` has been renamed to ``unknown``.
        
        - Allow ``colander.Mapping`` type to accept a new constructor
        argument: ``partial``.
        
        - New interface methods required by types and schema nodes:
        ``pserialize`` and ``pdeserialize``.  These partially serialize or
        partially deserialize a value (the definition of "partial" is up to
        the type).
        
        0.5 (2010-03-31)
        ----------------
        
        - 0.4 was mispackaged (CHANGES.txt missing); no code changes from 0.4
        however.
        
        0.4 (2010-03-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Add ``colander.DateTime`` and ``colander.Date`` data types.
        
        - Depend on the ``iso8601`` package for date support.
        
        0.3 (2010-03-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Subnodes of a schema node are now kept in the ``children`` attribute
        rather than the ``nodes`` attribute.
        
        - Add an ``sdefault`` property to ``colander.SchemaNode`` objects.
        
        - Add a ``clone`` method to ``colander.SchemaNode`` objects.
        
        - Add a ``__str__`` method to the ``colander.Invalid`` exception that
        prints an error summary.
        
        - Various error message improvements.
        
        - Add ``colander.Length`` validator class.
        
        0.2 (2010-03-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Make nodetype overrideable.
        
        - Add __getitem__ to SchemaNode.
        
        - Fix OneOf message.
        
        - Capitalize node titles.
        
        - Deal with empty strings in String, Boolean, and Float types.
        
        - Introduce description; make title the same as name.
        
        - Remove copy method from schemanode.
        
        - Allow schema nodes to have titles.
        
        - The term "structure" is too overloaded to use for schema purposes:
        structure -> schema node.
        
        - Make Sequence more like Tuple and Mapping (it uses a substructure
        rather than a structure parameter to denote its type).
        
        - Add __repr__ and copy methods to structure.
        
        - Add accept_scalar flag to Sequence.
        
        
        0.1 (2010-03-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
