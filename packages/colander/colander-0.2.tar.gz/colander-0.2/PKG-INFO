Description: Colander
        ========
        
        An extensible package which can be used to:
        
        - deserialize and validate a data structure composed of strings,
        mappings, and lists.
        
        - serialize an arbitrary data structure to a data structure composed
        of strings, mappings, and lists.

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2 (2010-03-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Make nodetype overrideable.
        
        - Add __getitem__ to SchemaNode.
        
        - Fix OneOf message.
        
        - Capitalize node titles.
        
        - Deal with empty strings in String, Boolean, and Float types.
        
        - Introduce description; make title the same as name.
        
        - Remove copy method from schemanode.
        
        - Allow schema nodes to have titles.
        
        - The term "structure" is too overloaded to use for schema purposes:
        structure -> schema node.
        
        - Make Sequence more like Tuple and Mapping (it uses a substructure
        rather than a structure parameter to denote its type).
        
        - Add __repr__ and copy methods to structure.
        
        - Add accept_scalar flag to Sequence.
        
        
        0.1 (2010-03-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
