IN DEVELOPMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0.3
~~~

This release slightly breaks compatability in order to get the cleanUp API
really solid : it now will report correctly with testtools 0.9.7, and 
generally does the right thing by default. Apologies to anyone affected by
this churn, but I felt the cleanness of the API was worth it.

CHANGES:

* When multiple exceptions are being raised from cleanUp, MultipleExceptions
  is used to report them all. This is preferentially imported from testtools
  and failing that defined locally. See testtools 0.9.7 for its use.

0.2
~~~

CHANGES:

* Exceptions raised during cleanup are no longer silently swallowed. They
  are returned in a list by default, or the first one is raised if raise_first
  is supplied. The TestCase glue code passes raise_first to cleanUp.
  (Robert Collins, #629032)

0.1
~~~

CHANGES:

* Created project. The primary interfaces are
  ``fixtures.TestWithFixtures`` and ``fixtures.Fixture``.
  Documentation is primarily in README.  (Robert Collins)
