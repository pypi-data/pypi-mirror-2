CHANGES:

* Exceptions raised during cleanup are no longer silently swallowed. They
  are returned in a list by default, or the first one is raised if raise_first
  is supplied. The TestCase glue code passes raise_first to cleanUp.
  (Robert Collins, #629032)

CHANGES:

* Created project. The primary interfaces are
  ``fixtures.TestWithFixtures`` and ``fixtures.Fixture``.
  Documentation is primarily in README.  (Robert Collins)
