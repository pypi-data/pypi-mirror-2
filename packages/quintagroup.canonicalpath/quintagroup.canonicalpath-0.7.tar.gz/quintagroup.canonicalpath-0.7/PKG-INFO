Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        quintagroup.canonicalpath package brings canonical path calculation
        functionality to Plone. The package allows to define path and/or link
        to the object, which may differ from standard physical path or its URL
        in portal.
        
        It's used by such products as quintagroup.seoptimizer (for defining
        canonical link of the object) and quintagroup.plonegooglesitemaps (on
        google sitemaps generation).
        
        This package is intended for bringing *canonical_path* and/or
        *canonical_link* property to any traversable object. For that purpose
        it defines ICanonicalPath and ICanonicalLink interfaces, and registers
        basic adapters for ITraversable objects.
        
        This package also registers *canonical_path* and *canonical_link* indexes
        for possible usage in catalog (ZCatalog).
        
        Default adapters behaviour:
        
        - `canonical_path` returns path from portal root, i.e. for `/plone/front-page` canonical_path will be `/front-page`.
        
        - `canonical_link` returns absoulute url of the object.
