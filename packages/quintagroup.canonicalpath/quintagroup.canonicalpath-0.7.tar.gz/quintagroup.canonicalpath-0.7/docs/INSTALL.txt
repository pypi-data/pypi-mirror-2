Installation
============

Buildout
--------

To install quintagroup.canonicalpath to your buildout-based project:

* Add ``quintagroup.canonicalpath`` to the list of eggs to install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.canonicalpath
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.canonicalpath
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    
* Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/instance restart
          

Traditional Zope 2 instance
---------------------------

To install quintagroup.canonicalpath into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to your instance's ``/lib/python`` directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.canonicalpath-configure.zcml`` in your instance's ``/etc/package-includes`` directory. The file
should only contain this::

    <include package="quintagroup.canonicalpath" />

* Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart
