3.7.1 (2010-09-25)
------------------

- Added test extra to declare test dependency on ``zope.component [test]``.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.


3.7.0 (2009-03-14)
------------------

- Removed ``zope.container`` dependency, as contained principals didn't make any
  sense, since PrincipalRegistry never provided IContainer. Also, zope.container
  pulls a number dependencies, that are not needed for non-persistent principal
  registry (like, ZCML, for example).

  Set __name__ and __parent__ by hand to provide some backward-compatibility and
  to save a pointer to registry from principal objects.

- Initial release. This package was splitted from zope.app.security as a part
  of the refactoring process to provide global principal registry without extra
  dependencies.
