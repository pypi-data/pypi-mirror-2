            HolyView is still in beta, use at your own risks.
        
        Presentation
        ------------
        Holyview is a tool design to help you choosing what could be the most efficient
        thing to work on right now. It is based on the approach suggested by Stephen
        Covey of classifying things by importance and urgence and to focus on important
        and non-urgent stuff.
        
        More details here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_(book)
        
        To see your items in a grid (like that
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MerrillCoveyMatrix.png) press the G key.
        
        Usage example
        -------------
        Create severals items (using 'a'). Change their importances/urgences using
        'i'/'I' and 'u'/'U'. Press G to enter grid mode. Choose what to do. Do it. Save
        the world.
        
        You have worked on a task? Just press + to give it one more point. The date
        when you have added a point is recorded. This way, graphiques of activities will be
        possible.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        As root::
