-------
Install
-------

compactxml is a pure python library, and should be platform independent. It
has been developed and tested on python 2.6 on linux, however. As
dependencies, it requires that lxml and pyparsing be installed to function.

A normal ``python setup.py install`` command should work to install the
library.

-----
Usage
-----

There is a compactxml.expand function for converting from compact XML syntax
to XML, and a compactxml.compact function for converting from XML to compact
XML syntax, with variations on both depending on the output format desired.
help( compactxml ) will give better usage instructions, and the included
documentation in docs/compactxml.rst or docs/HTML/index.html provides a
comprehensive overview of the compact xml syntax.

Any errors in expansion or compaction are raised as compactxml.ParsingError.

There is also a command line utility ``compactxml`` in the source distribution
which can be used for converting from/to compact xml syntax. See ``compactxml
--help`` for usage information after installation.
