class Field(object):
    """ Represents an individual form field (a visible object in a
    form rendering).

    A :class:`deform.form.Field` object instance is meant to last for
    the duration of a single web request. As a result, a field object
    is often used as a scratchpad by the widget associated with that
    field.  Using a field as a scratchpad makes it possible to build
    implementations of state-retaining widgets while instances of
    those widget still only need to be constructed once instead of on
    each request.
    
    All field objects have the following attributes:

    schema
        The schema node associated with this field.

    widget
        The widget associated with this field.

    order
        An integer indicating the relative order of this field's
        construction to its children and parents.

    oid
        A string incorporating the ``order`` attribute that can be
        used as a unique identifier in HTML code (often for ``id``
        attributes of field-related elements).  An example oid is
        ``deformField0``.

    name
        An alias for self.schema.name
    
    title
        An alias for self.schema.title

    description
        An alias for self.schema.description

    required
        An alias for self.schema.required

    typ
        An alias for self.schema.typ

    children
        Child fields of this field.

    error
        The exception raised by the last attempted validation of the
        schema element associated with this field.  By default, this
        attribute is ``None``.  If non-None, this attribute is usually
        an instance of the exception class
        :exc:`colander.Invalid`, which has a ``msg`` attribute
        providing a human-readable validation error message.

    errormsg
        The ``msg`` attribute of the ``error`` attached to this field
        or ``None`` if the ``error`` attached to this field is ``None``.

    renderer
        The template :term:`renderer` associated with the form.  If a
        renderer is not passed to the constructor, the default deform
        renderer will be used (the :term:`default renderer`).

    counter
        ``None`` or an instance of ``itertools.counter`` which is used
        to generate sequential order-related attributes such as
        ``oid`` and ``order``.

    ``renderer`` and ``counter`` are accepted as keyword arguments to
    the :class:`deform.Field` constructor as well as being present as
    attribute values.  If they are ``None`` (their default), suitable
    values are used in their place.

        two-tuple should be in the form ``(key, value)``.  ``node``
        should be the schema node associated with this widget.

        For example, using WebOb, you can compute a suitable value for
        ``controls`` via::

          request.POST.items()

        Or, if you're using a ``cgi.FieldStorage`` object named
        ``fs``, you can compute a suitable value for ``controls``
        via::

          controls = []
          if fs.list:
              for control in fs.list:

                  else:
                      controls.append((control.name, control.value))

        Equivalent ways of computing ``controls`` should be available to
        any web framework.

        When the ``validate`` method is called:

        - if the fields are successfully validated, a data structure
          represented by the deserialization of the data as per the
          schema is returned.  It will be a mapping.

        - If the fields cannot be successfully validated, a
          :exc:`colander.Invalid` exception is raised.

        The typical usage of ``validate`` in the wild is often
        something like this (at least in terms of code found within
        the body of a :mod:`repoze.bfg` view function, the particulars
        will differ in your web framework)::
