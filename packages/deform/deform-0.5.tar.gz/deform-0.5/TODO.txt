TODOs
=====

- [X] Error message translations.

- [_] Progressive form validation (show validation errors as you
      type).  This includes (supersedes) these previously top-level
      TODO items:

      - [_] Add regex pattern-matching widgets.

      - [_] Add an e-mail widget.

- [X] Date widget with picker (see ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget``).

- [_] Time widget with picker.

- [_] DateTime widget with pickers.

- [X] Add a single-select widget.

- [X] Add a multi-select checkbox widget.

- [X] Add a "combo-box" widget (serviced by AutoComplete text box)

      o Mixes free-form input with a drop-down.


- [_] Add a multi-select widget using dual lists.

- [X] Add "fixed-lentgh" string widgets (done by using jquery.maskedinput in 
      text input field)

      o E.g., in parts of an SSN, filling in all digits in the first
        part's field jumps automatically to the second.

- [_] Add a country / postal code widget

      o Does a lookup and shows city and state / province.

- [_] Add an ISBN widget.

      o Does a lookup and shows author, title, etc..

- [X] Make forms automagically put the cursor into the first field of a form.

- [X] Readonly widget variants

- [X] Use case: require (email or phonenumber; see
      require_one_or_another in deformdemo).

- [X] Add a convention that allows a widget to specify the (logical)
      resources it requires (e.g. ["foo.css", "jquery"]).  Add an API
      that allows you to retrieve all the logical resources required
      by all widgets that are part of a form.

- [X] Provide a lame default widget for tuples in order to avoid ``
      File "/Users/...deform/widget.py", line 92, in serialize raise
      NotImplementedError`` during serialization or provide a better
      error message (maybe a subclass of Widget that spits out a more
      informative error message).  (used TextInputCSV widget).

- [ ] Somehow prevent schemas that have sequence types (tuples and
      sequences) that have no schema children from reaching the point
      where we try to serialize them, as a hapless user will wind up
      with a `` File "/Users/...../deform/widget.py", line 773, in
      serialize item_field = field.children[0]`` exception instead of
      a more sensible error message.

- [ ] Allow for single-field readonly renderings (e.g. on an add form,
      the name must be provided, on an edit form the name cannot be
      provided).

- [ ] Make deform.widget.RichText render only on oid specific element
      in templates.

- [ ] Work out default height and width defaults and overrides for
      them, then document how to do so.

- [ ] Add placeholder text to
      :class:`deform.widget.AutocompleteinputWidget`
