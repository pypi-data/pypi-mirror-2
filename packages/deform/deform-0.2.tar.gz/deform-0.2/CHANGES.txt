0.2 (2010-05-13)
----------------

- Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
  is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
  in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
  constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
  form's buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.

- The ``deform.Form`` class now accepts two extra keyword arguments in
  its constructor: ``use_ajax`` and ``ajax_options``.

  If ``use_ajax`` is ``True``, the page is not reloaded when a submit
  button is pressed.  Instead, the form is posted, and the result
  replaces the DOM node on the page.

  ``ajax_options`` is a string which allows you to pass extra options
  to the underlying AJAX form machinery when ``use_ajax`` is True.

- Added a couple Ajax examples to the demo app.

- Add a rudimentary Ajax chapter to the docs.

0.1 (2010-05-09)
