        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2 (2010-05-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
        is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
        in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
        constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
        form's buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.
        
        - The ``deform.Form`` class now accepts two extra keyword arguments in
        its constructor: ``use_ajax`` and ``ajax_options``.
        
        If ``use_ajax`` is ``True``, the page is not reloaded when a submit
        button is pressed.  Instead, the form is posted, and the result
        replaces the DOM node on the page.
        
        ``ajax_options`` is a string which allows you to pass extra options
        to the underlying AJAX form machinery when ``use_ajax`` is True.
        
        - Added a couple Ajax examples to the demo app.
        
        - Add a rudimentary Ajax chapter to the docs.
        
        0.1 (2010-05-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
