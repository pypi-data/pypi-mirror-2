        Bug Fixes
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Change default form action to the empty string (rather than ``.``).
        Thanks to Kiran.
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Add ``deform.widget.DateInputWidget`` widget, which is a date picker
        widget.  This has now become the default widget for the
        ``colander.Date`` schema type, preferred to the date parts widget.
        
        - Add text input mask capability to ``deform.widget.TextInputWidget``.
        
        - Add text input mask capability to
        ``deform.widget.CheckedInputWidget``.
        
        Backwards Incompatibilities
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Custom widgets must now check for ``colander.null`` rather than
        ``None`` as the null sentinel value.
        
        - Dependency on a new (0.7) version of Colander, which has been
        changed to make using proper defaults possible; if you've used the
        ``default`` argument to a ``colander.SchemaNode``, or if you've
        defined a custom Colander type, you'll want to read `the updated
        Colander documentation <http://docs.repoze.org/colander>`_
        (particularly the changelist).  Short story: use the ``missing``
        argument instead.
        
        - If you've created a custom widget, you will need to tweak it
        slightly to handle the value ``colander.null`` as input to both
        ``serialize`` and ``deserialize``.  See the Deform docs at
        `http://docs.repoze.org/deform <http://docs.repoze.org/deform>`_ for
        more information.

        ----------------
        
        - Every form has a formid now, defaulting to ``deform``.  The formid
        is used to compute the id of the form tag as well as the button ids
        in the form.  Previously, if a formid was not passed to the Form
        constructor, no id would be given to the rendered form and the
        form's buttons would not be prefixed with any formid.
        
        - The ``deform.Form`` class now accepts two extra keyword arguments in
        its constructor: ``use_ajax`` and ``ajax_options``.
        
        If ``use_ajax`` is ``True``, the page is not reloaded when a submit
        button is pressed.  Instead, the form is posted, and the result
        replaces the DOM node on the page.
        
        ``ajax_options`` is a string which allows you to pass extra options
        to the underlying AJAX form machinery when ``use_ajax`` is True.
        
        - Added a couple Ajax examples to the demo app.
        
        - Add a rudimentary Ajax chapter to the docs.
        
        0.1 (2010-05-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
