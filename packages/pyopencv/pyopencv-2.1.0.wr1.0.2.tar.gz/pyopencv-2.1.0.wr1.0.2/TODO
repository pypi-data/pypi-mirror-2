Image conversion to/from wxWidget

Provide more demos -- may ask people to help :)

Fix squares.py demo, something's wrong with the algorithm. It's running but too slow.

Add iterator for SparseMat

- 2d lists should have better documentation: i.e. when is list of Mat, when is list of lists

- introduce debugging mode so that people know which argument has been converted, which has been not

- to_list_of_... returns vector_....
- make to_list_of_... obsolete in the future
- propose to group a major change of representation from 1D array and 2D array back to std::vector
  arrays. 
  
- On Windows, there seems to be a problem when libopencv_ffmpeg210.dll is used --> VideoCapture
  of a video file stops working. Remove the ffmpeg dll file and it appears to work again.
  
- fix cvInitSystem, currently bp::str is not automatically converted into char const *.

- expose C functions for class CvSet, write a Set<T> that is a subclass of Seq<T>?
