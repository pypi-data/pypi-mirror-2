Thanks go to many people in the ctypes-opencv Google group as well as
those have contacted me via email for their invaluable discussion and 
idea contributions.

Thanks also go to the people at Intel and Willow Garage for having 
invented and developed OpenCV. 

ctypes-opencv
-------------

PyOpenCV inherits many features from its preceder, ctypes-opencv, which 
had received an enormous amount of ideas, suggestions, and code 
contributions by many people. I would like to thank the following people
in particular:
- Gary Bishop (and former contributors) for his CVtypes package, which 
  precedes ctypes-opencv
- Jérémy Bethmont for his contributions in conversion between IplImage 
  and PIL's Image, and in detection of OpenCV's libraries
- David Bolen for his many suggestions and contributions
- And many people in the ctypes-opencv Google group
