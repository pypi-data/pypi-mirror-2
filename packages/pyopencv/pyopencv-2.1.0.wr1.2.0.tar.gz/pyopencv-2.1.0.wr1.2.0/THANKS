PyOpenCV - A Python wrapper for OpenCV 2.x using Boost.Python and NumPy
=======================================================================

Thanks go to many people in the ctypes-opencv Google group as well as
those have contacted me via email for their invaluable discussion and 
contributions. In particular, I would like to thank:

- Gijs Molenaar for his help in packaging PyOpenCV and ctypes-opencv on 
  Ubuntu
- Dat Chu for his proposal of using CMake to build PyOpenCV and his
  efforts in making the proposal become a reality
- Thomas Newmann for his contribution in fixing ndarray so that PyOpenCV
  works with 64-bit platforms
- Attila Bergou for his contributions in making PyOpenCV work on 64-bit 
  Ubuntu and Mac OS X 10.6

Thanks also go to the people at Intel and Willow Garage for having 
invented and developed OpenCV. 

ctypes-opencv
-------------

PyOpenCV inherits many features from its preceder, ctypes-opencv, which 
had received an enormous amount of ideas, suggestions, and code 
contributions by many people. I would like to thank the following people
in particular:
- Gary Bishop (and former contributors) for his CVtypes package, which 
  precedes ctypes-opencv
- Jérémy Bethmont for his contributions in conversion between IplImage 
  and PIL's Image, and in detection of OpenCV's libraries
- David Bolen for his many suggestions and contributions
- And many people in the ctypes-opencv Google group
