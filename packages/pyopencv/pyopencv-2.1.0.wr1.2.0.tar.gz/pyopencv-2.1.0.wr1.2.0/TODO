PyOpenCV - A Python wrapper for OpenCV 2.x using Boost.Python and NumPy
=======================================================================

- To add fast polygonal integration (cvpr'10)

- To update wiki the instructions for installing PyOpenCV via CMake and setuptools

- To support 64-bit platforms

- Image conversion to/from wxWidget

- Provide more demos -- may ask people to help :)

- Fix squares.py demo, something's wrong with the algorithm. It's running but too slowly.

- Add iterator for SparseMat

- 2d lists should have better documentation: i.e. when is list of Mat, when is list of lists

- introduce debugging mode so that people know which argument has been converted, which has been not

- On Windows, there seems to be a problem when libopencv_ffmpeg210.dll is used --> VideoCapture
  of a video file stops working. Remove the ffmpeg dll file and it appears to work again.
  
- expose C functions for class CvSet, write a Set<T> that is a subclass of Seq<T>?

- make_nurse_and_patient(nurse, patient) = keep 'patient' alive as long as 'nurse' is alive, weird.
