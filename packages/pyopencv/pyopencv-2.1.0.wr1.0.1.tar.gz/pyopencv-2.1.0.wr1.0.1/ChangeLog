Change Log
==========

pyopencv-2.1.0.wr1.0.1 bug-fix release
--------------------------------------

This bug-fix release is released earlier than scheduled due toa bug at 
file 'bjamcompiler.py', which may lead to a "Segmentation Fault" while 
building PyOpenCV on Linux. Other changes including spliting some 
meta-functions into a individual ones and removing 24 unnecessary 
Mat_<...> classes.

- fixed a bug in bjamcompiler.py that could lead to a "Segmentation Fault" 
  if numpy has not been installed at the build-time of PyOpenCV
- improved the docstrings in old-style C structures
- re-enabled CvTermCriteria to support old C-style structures
- re-enabled CvBox2D for backward compatibility with old C-style structures
- re-enabled CvPoint* classes, for backward compatibility with old C-style 
  structures
- re-enabled CvScalar to support old C-style structures
- replaced Range.as_CvSlice() with asCvSlice()
- reenabled CvSlice to support old C-style structures
- added function getOptimalNewCameraMatrix()
- added stereoRectify() and stereoRectify2()
- split function convexHull() into convexHull_int() and 
  convexHull_float32()
- split function approxPolyDP() into approxPolyDP_int() and 
  approxPolyDP_float32()
- removed the 24 Mat_<...> classes; yup, bad idea to have included them
- split RNG.uniform() into 3 functions


pyopencv-2.1.0.wr1.0.0 bug-fix release
--------------------------------------

This is the first release of PyOpenCV that supports OpenCV 2.1.0. The 
wrapper's version has been reset to 1.0.0. All new features of OpenCV 2.1.0 
have been exposed.

- added 24 Mat_<...> classes of OpenCV 2.1
- added function getCPUTickCount()
- added functions set/getWindowProperty()
- added function cvCheckHardwareSupport()
- added 4 classes: BackgroundSubtractor, BackgroundSubtractorMOG, 
  CvAffinePose, and DefaultRngAuto
- added function find4QuadCornerSubpix()
- added class StereoSGBM
- added functions filterSpeckles(), getValidDisparityROI(), and 
  validateDisparity()
- added function grabCut()
- added function cvCheckChessboard()
- added function cvCalcOpticalFlowFarneback()
- updated almost all changes in existing functions
- temporarily removed class OneWayDescriptorObject as it is somehow not 
  included in OpenCV's shared library

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.1.1 bug-fix release
------------------------------------

- improved the exposal of class CvHaarClassifier and its member variables
- re-enabled CvRect, CvSize, and CvHidHaarClassifierCascade for supporting 
  some old C code
- exposed some member variables of CvHaarClassifier
- split function_transformers.py into two
- exposed other member variables of CvHaarFeature
- improved the exposal of class FernClassifier
- improved functions calcBackProject() and calcHist()
- exposed some parts of class NAryMatNDIterator
- improved many docstrings
- added C++ functions to convert a list of Mats to a C/C++-equivalent array
- improved the docstrings of function arguments of type std::vector
- fixed some calling sequences of min(), max(), sqrt(), pow(), exp(), len()
- added docstrings to some MatND's constructors
- fixed a bug in ndarray
- added a large number of conversion functions in the form of as<ClassName>()
- added representation strings for classes Complexd and Complexf
- improved function asMat()
- added a demo of using DifferentialImage

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.1.0 beta release
---------------------------------

This release is backward-incompatible with previous releases. A large number 
of function arguments and calling sequences have been tweaked. These 
necessary tweaks would allow PyOpenCV to run slightly more efficiently and 
to be easier to use.

- added find_obj.py, a demo on using SURF and flann
- added docstrings for a large number of functions
- added code that converts between Mat and external image representations 
  like wx.Bitmap, gtk.pixbuf, PIL.Image
- provided ndarray interface for Size-like classes
- provided converters to convert between cv::Mat and Python list of items
- converted input 1d array arguments into cv::Mat
- added FernClassifier and PlanarObjectDetector classes
- improved calling sequences in classes SURF, MSER, LDetector, and 
  StarDetector
- improved all output function arguments of type std::vector
- improved get_CvMat_ptr() and get_IplImage_ptr()
- lots of bug-fixes

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.2 beta release
---------------------------------
- improved snakeImage()
- added 3 new classes: DifferentialImage, IntegralImage, and IntegralHistogram
- removed all the C functions related to CvHistogram. They are deprecated. Use 
  calcHist(), equalizeHist(), compareHist() instead.
- modified CascadeClassifier so that runAt() and setImage() also support old 
  cascades
- fixed a calling sequence of functions knnSearch() and radiusSearch() of class 
  Index
- added ndarray interface to Rect-like classes and the Range class
- improved the behavior of 1d array function arguments
- fixed a bug that could lead to a segfault
- added classes: IndexParams, IndexFactory
- improved SURF, mixChannels() and minMaxLoc()

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.1 beta release
---------------------------------

- fixed the demo files according to recent changes
- improved conversion from ndarray to Mat and MatND
- removed from_ndarray() functions
- common std::vectors of primitive data types like 'int', 'float', etc and 
  fixed-size data types like Vec-like, Point-like, Scalar are now represented 
  as ndarrays
- improved contours.py
- added a few classes of cvvidsurv.hpp, fixed a bug in OpenCV's findContours() 
  function, and added contours.py demo
- fixed a bug in getting a temporary pointer to CvMat or IplImage, this patch 
  will incur a complete rebuild if you are building pyopencv from source
- renamed convertPointsHomogeneous functions
- fixed read() and write() functions
- added some more machine-learning classes
- added a few tree-based classes
- added CvDTreeTrainData
- fixed a bug in CvEM
- fixed a bug in CvKNearest
- fixed a bug in CvNormalBayesClassifier
- fixed a bug in CvSVM
- added CvSVM::get_support_vector()
- fixed a bug in CvSVMParams
- fixed a bug in invoking Mat(int, int, int)

pyopencv-2.0.wr1.0.0 pre-beta release
-------------------------------------

- The first release of PyOpenCV. Many fundamentals of OpenCV have been
ported to Python. However, there is still some functionality not fully
available. Lots of small issues need ironing out. Just tell me which
parts you want PyOpenCV to improve and I will take time to improve them.
