        What came first, the worm or the fish__?
        
        .. __: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fish
        
        Ever wanted to have animating worms for progress bars in your command-line
        script?
        
        Inspired by Ludvig Ericson, author of ``fish``, I present ``worm``. Thus
        proving that I don't have better things to do with my time than to write
        meaningless ASCII animation programs.
        
        ``worm``, the module that makes any program represent its
        sluggishness to the console while churning away on some good 'ole data.
        
        Usage? Simple enough:
        
        >>> import worm
        >>> while churning:
        ...     churn_churn()
        ...     worm.animate()
        
        There is nothing more to say except:
        
        Possibilities are endless here, gentlemen:
        
        The only limit is yourself.

        Note: unlike ``fish`` this progress bar is *awesome* and requires a UTF-8
        terminal to work its *awesomeness* in.
