Description: Django JSON Serializer
        
        This is a django serializer that outputs sensible json to be sent to the
        frontend, rather than intended as a serializer to a file. Here's an example:
        
        >>> print s.serialize(User.objects.all(), relations=['groups'], excludes=['user_permissions'], indent=4)
        [
            {
                "username": "dusty", 
                "first_name": "", 
                "last_name": "", 
                "is_active": true, 
                "is_superuser": true, 
                "is_staff": true, 
                "last_login": "2010-11-26 13:27:07", 
                "groups": [
                    {
                        "pk": 1, 
                        "model": "auth.group", 
                        "name": "hello", 
                        "permissions": []
                    }
                ], 
                "pk": 1, 
                "model": "auth.user", 
                "password": "sha1$8f816$b4c8139100c314b46f1ca931858e4d6d5c61917f", 
                "email": "dusty@linux.ca", 
                "date_joined": "2010-11-22 17:55:40"
            }
        ]
        
        
        
        This project was originally forked from:
        https://code.google.com/p/wadofstuff/wiki/DjangoFullSerializers
        
        The original code produced a json format that was good for ./manage.py dump and
        load, but wasn't as suitable for sending data to a web client for processing
        via ajax.
