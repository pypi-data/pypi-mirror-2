Django JSON Serializer

This is a django serializer that outputs sensible json to be sent to the
frontend, rather than intended as a serializer to a file. Here's an example:

>>> print s.serialize(User.objects.all(), relations=['groups'], excludes=['user_permissions'], indent=4)
[
    {
        "username": "dusty", 
        "first_name": "", 
        "last_name": "", 
        "is_active": true, 
        "is_superuser": true, 
        "is_staff": true, 
        "last_login": "2010-11-26 13:27:07", 
        "groups": [
            {
                "pk": 1, 
                "model": "auth.group", 
                "name": "hello", 
                "permissions": []
            }
        ], 
        "pk": 1, 
        "model": "auth.user", 
        "password": "sha1$8f816$b4c8139100c314b46f1ca931858e4d6d5c61917f", 
        "email": "dusty@linux.ca", 
        "date_joined": "2010-11-22 17:55:40"
    }
]



This project was originally forked from:
https://code.google.com/p/wadofstuff/wiki/DjangoFullSerializers

The original code produced a json format that was good for ./manage.py dump and
load, but wasn't as suitable for sending data to a web client for processing
via ajax.
