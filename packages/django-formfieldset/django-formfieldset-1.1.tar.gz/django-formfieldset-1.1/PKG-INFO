Description: **django-formfieldset** is a simple Django app that provides a mix-in class for admin-like fieldset rendering.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Fieldset functionality similar to ``ModelAdmin``
        - Shorthand rendering functions with fieldsets both for whole forms and for individual fieldsets
        
          - render as ``P``
          - render as ``TABLE``
          - render as ``UL``
        
        - Template strings are class attributes
        - Overrides nothing in ``django.forms.Form``
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        #. Add ``"django-formfieldset"`` directory to your Python path.
        #. Add ``"formfieldset"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` tuple found in
           your settings file. (optional - to be able to run tests)
        
        
        Testing & Example
        =================
        
        There is an example project in the ``example/`` directory. To run
        automated tests for django-formfieldset run the following command
        in ``example/`` directory:
        
        ::
        
            python example/manage.py test formfieldset
        
        To run the example project:
        
        ::
        
            python example/manage.py runserver
        
        Then you can visit ``http://localhost:8000/`` to view the example.
        **Example project also serves as detailed documentation for formfieldset**.
        
        Code examples will be highlighted if you have ``pygments`` installed.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        #. Create your form with ``FieldsetMixin``.
        #. Add a ``fieldsets`` attribute to your form. See
           `admin docs <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#fieldsets>`_
           for detailed explanation.
        #. Render your form with fieldset enabled methods:
        
           -  You can use ``iter_fieldsets()`` for custom form rendering. It
              will yield ``Fieldset`` objects. ``Fieldset``\ s act as iterators for
              widgets in them.
           -  You can use ``as_fieldset_table()``, ``as_fieldset_ul()`` and
              ``as_fieldset_p()`` methods that act like built-in ``as_*`` method
              except fieldset support.
