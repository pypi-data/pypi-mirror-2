 Introduction
==============

DistChecker helps with testing project sdist's.  Once installed
the ``distchecker`` command will be available.  So far all commands
are expected to be run against a directory which is a project
egg directory.

Initial setup can be generated by running::

  distchecker --setup-config

Example usage is as follows::

  # check to make sure the generated sdist is the same as the source
  # files contained in the development directory
  distchecker compare_sdist SomeEggDir

  # install the given egg into a fresh virtualenv and print out
  # information such as test coverage and the exact snapshot
  # of dependent eggs that was used
  distchecker test_sdist SomeEggDir

  # in this case SomeEggDir is expected to be an egg
  # providing a paster template ... running the command
  # will install the egg into a fresh virtualenv and then
  # create a new egg based on the given paster template and
  # run its tests
  distchecker test_paster_template SomeEggDir somepastertemplate

Please be aware that the temporary virtualenv directories created
are not currently removed due to debugging purposes.
