Description: A flexible system to modify the text in a clipboard in a variety of ways.
        Out of the box we have:
          * Copy a spreadsheet and change the clipboard so that it can be pasted into a
          * wiki, with vertical bars (|) instead of tabs.  Modify your multi-line clipboard text so that it can be pasted into Java or Python as strings.
          * Modify an URL in the clipboard pointing to Amazon so that it has your Associate ID in it. 
          * Run a shell command piping the clipboard to it and retrieving the output from it.
          * Force a clibpboard to text (removing formatting, etc.).
          * Convert a complicated url into it's python equivalent, using urlencode.
          * And many more...
        
        It uses wxPython and when you bring it's window to the front it modifies
        the clipboard with the currently selected utility.
