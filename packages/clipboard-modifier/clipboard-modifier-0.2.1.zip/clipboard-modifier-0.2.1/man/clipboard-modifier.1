.B Clipboard-modifier

Out of the box we have:
  * Copy a spreadsheet and change the clipboard so that it can be pasted into a
  * wiki, with vertical bars (|) instead of tabs.  Modify your multi-line clipboard text so that it can be pasted into Java or Python as strings.
  * Modify an URL in the clipboard pointing to Amazon so that it has your Associate ID in it. 
  * Run a shell command piping the clipboard to it and retrieving the output from it.
  * Force a clibpboard to text (removing formatting, etc.).
  * Convert a complicated url into it's python equivalent, using urlencode.
  * And many more...
