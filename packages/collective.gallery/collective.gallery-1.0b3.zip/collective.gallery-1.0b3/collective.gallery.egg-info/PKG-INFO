        Components
        ==========
        
        collective.gallery use zope.components to provide as much reusable as possible components.
        
        First we have photo resources. Plone already manage this for you:
        
        * Folder and Large Plone Folder can contains Image
        * Topic can be criterized to list only Image
        * Link can be sources of photos throw picasaweb.google.com and flickr.com services.
        
        Next you have the business component: IGallery. This interface is implemented at two levels:
        
        * As named adapter over IATLink to get photos from picasaweb or flickr.
        * As browserview to control the resource (@@gallery)
        
        The picasaweb and flickr services let you embed a flash slideshow to display your photos.
        Views are already available to use those services:
        
        * @@gallery-picasaweb-slideshow
        * @@gallery-flickr-slideshow
        
        But they are not integrated in the Plone UI.
        
        Roadmap
        =======
        
        * [1.0] finish the css
        * [1.1] exif integration
        * [2.0] add photos
        * [2.0] search photos
        * [2.0] collective.harlequin as an extra dependency
