Description:         This project is designed as an add-on for networkx, a graph library for
              Python. It accepts a variety of different spatial formats to generate
              directional graphs and provides simple modules to correct flow errors,
              find specific nodes by attribute, and run a depth first search (trace)
              with stopping points.
