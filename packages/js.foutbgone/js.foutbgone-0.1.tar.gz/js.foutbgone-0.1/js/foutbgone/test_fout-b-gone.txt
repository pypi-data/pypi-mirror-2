How to use?
===========


You can import FOUT-B-Gone from ``js.foutbgone`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.foutbgone import foutbgone
  >>> foutbgone.need()

There is also an init available which renders the initialization into the HTML::

  >>> from js.foutbgone import foutbgone_init
  >>> from fanstatic import NeededResources
  >>> needed = NeededResources()
  >>> needed.need(foutbgone_init)
  >>> print needed.render()
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/fanstatic/fout-b-gone/foutbgone.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">fbg.hideFOUT('asap');</script>
