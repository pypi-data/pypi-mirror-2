Introduction
============

This library packages `FOUT-B-Gone`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`FOUT-B-Gone`: http://www.extensis.com/en/WebINK/fout-b-gone/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.foutbgone``) are published to some URL.
