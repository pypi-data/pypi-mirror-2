        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `FOUT-B-Gone`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`FOUT-B-Gone`: http://www.extensis.com/en/WebINK/fout-b-gone/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.foutbgone``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import FOUT-B-Gone from ``js.foutbgone`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.foutbgone import foutbgone
          >>> foutbgone.need()
        
        There is also an init available which renders the initialization into the HTML::
        
          >>> from js.foutbgone import foutbgone_init
          >>> from fanstatic import NeededResources
          >>> needed = NeededResources()
          >>> needed.need(foutbgone_init)
          >>> print needed.render()
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/fanstatic/fout-b-gone/foutbgone.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript">fbg.hideFOUT('asap');</script>
