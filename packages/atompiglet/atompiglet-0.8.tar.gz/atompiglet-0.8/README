Despite the fact that atompubbase was written by an AtomPub luminary,
I can't deal with the fact that it doesn't have:
* versioned releases
* passing tests (in our fork)
* a non-toxic interface

Here's a sketch of what I want (FCurl- and lxml 2.1.2-backed):
  >>> import atompiglet.server, atompiglet.auth, atompiglet.entry
  >>> test_kurt_un = atompiglet.server.Server(atompiglet.server.Server.TEST_KURT)
  A Server instance...

  >> test_kurt = atompiglet.server.Server(atompiglet.server.Server.TEST_KURT, auth=atompiglet.auth.BasicAuth('orm', '123456789'))
  An authenticated Server instance...

  >>> test_kurt.service_doc()
  I need to go looking for some OpenSearch stuff in the etree directly

  >>> orm_wksp    = test_kurt.workspaces["O'Reilly"]
  A Workspace with that atom:title

  >>> pdf_cols = orm_wksp.collections_for_mimetype('application/pdf')
  A list of all Collections that accept application/pdf documents.

  >>> webpdfs_col = orm_wksp.collections["Web PDFs"]
  A Collection with that atom:title

  >>> new_entry   = webpdfs_col.add_from_file("tests/files/a_test.pdf", "application/pdf")
  An Entry that we just created from a file 

  >>> new_entry.etree
  I'm a big boy, I can handle the XML

  >>> import atompiglet.rdf
  >>> atompiglet.rdf.set_is_format_of(new_entry, "urn:x-domain:oreilly.com:test:1")
  Add/Update an RDF block with a dc:isFormatOf

  >>> new_entry.title = "A Test Entry"
  >>> new_entry.commit_updates()
  Update the atom:title our copy of an Entry and then tell the server.

  >>> new_entry.edited 
  2009-01-16T00:22:30.407Z

  >>> atompiglet.rdf.rdf_from_entry(new_entry)
  An etree containing the entry's metadata in RDF form.

  >>> new_entry.delete()
  Bye, bye

  >>> for entry in webpdfs_col.entries:
  ...     print entry.location
  A screen-full of the locations of every entry in the webpdfs collection.

  >>> from __future__ import with_statement
  >>> with new_entry:
  ...     new_entry.title = "A New Title"
  new_entry.commit_updates is run at the end of the with block.

  >>> with new_entry:
  ...     new_entry.title = int('Raises an Exception')
  new_entry.commit_updates is not run. new_entry is in an inconsistent state
  and should not be used; the exception will propagate.

  >>> old_entry = atompiglet.entry.Entry.from_url(some_saved_url)
  Some entry we knew about before, sans auth.

  >>> old_entry = atompiglet.entry.Entry.from_url(some_saved_url, auth_source=test_kurt)
  Some entry we knew about before, with auth from test_kurt.
