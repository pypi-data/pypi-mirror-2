        This product lets you include google map service in a Plone 3 environment.
        The Tecnoteca GoogleMap module extends Plone 3 with the capability to display
        different maps with macro-categories, categories, markers, paths and areas.
        Thanks to the Plone relations feature it's possible to define georeference
        from/to map markers and other Plone objects.
        
        Features
        
        - Complete map definition (center,zoom,size,advanced controls,etc) for each map
        - Custom categories with custom icons and unlimited markers per category
        - Location widget to define markers' position
        - Custom paths
        - Custom areas
        - Georeference for plone pages, events, news, images etc
        - Portlet to show georeference relations
        - Panoramio photos
        - JQuery based interface
        - Italian and English localizations
        
        Scenario
        
        You have a Plone site and you'd like to add several maps (culture, health,
        transportation, etc) each one containing several categories (ie museums,
        theaters, churches etc), and every category containing several markers
        (ie museum n.1, museum n.2, museum n.3 etc).
        Moreover you'd like to link together the content page regarding the "museum n.1"
        and the marker "museum n.1" you've defined in your map, so that a user reading
        the content page could see where that specific museum is located.
        Finally, you'd like to highlight some areas of your city / territory (ie highlight
        residential area) and highlight some paths (ie highlight streets or tourist routes).
