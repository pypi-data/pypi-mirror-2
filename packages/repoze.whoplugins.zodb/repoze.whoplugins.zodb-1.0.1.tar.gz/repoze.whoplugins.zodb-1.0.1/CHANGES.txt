repoze.whoplugins.zodb Changelog
================================

1.0.1 (2010-11-12)
------------------

- Don't barf when application supplies unicode passwords. (LP #666767)

1.0 (2010-10-29)
----------------

- Raise ValueError when something attempts to overwrite an existing
  user ID or login.

- Updated persistence triggering code to avoid potential persistence
  bugs.

- Fixed bug in Users.change_login that left old logins laying around.

0.8 (2009-07-01)
----------------

- Restored older behavior for Users.users_in_group: returns empty set for
  non-existant groups.

0.7 (2009-06-26)
----------------

- Fixed triggering of persistence in Users.add_user_to_group() and
  Users.remove_user_from_group().  Changes were not b eing persisted
  every time.  Also added comments to call out statements that do
  nothing but trigger persistence.

0.6 (2009-06-26)
----------------

- ``add_user_to_group`` had a bug which caused it to add a group name
  as a member of itself.

0.5 (2009-06-25)
----------------

- Overhauled Users implementation; changed API.  Backwards compatible
  unless you directly access the "bylogin" attribute.

- 100% test coverage.

- This plugin can now retrieve the ZODB connection from the WSGI
  environment if another WSGI component (such as
  ``repoze.zodbconn#connector``) has placed the connection in the
  environment.

- Added the impersonate plugin, which allows superusers to log in
  as someone else without knowing the other user's password.

- The code was swallowing ConnectionStateError, which is wrong because
  that pattern could lead to connections remaining open but no longer
  usable. Replaced the pattern with a transaction abort just before
  closing the connection. (Note that the plugin does not attempt to
  close the connection anyway if the connection is provided in the WSGI
  environment.)

0.4 (2009-02-18)
----------------

- Add a ``users_in_group`` method; it returns the user ids for
  a group given the group name.

0.3 (2009-01-06)
----------------

- Update for repoze.zodbconn ``dbfactory_from_uri`` returning a single
  argument rather than four.

0.2 (2008-12-16)
----------------

- Don't re-mangle an already SHA-encoded password when adding or removing
  groups to / from a user, or whe changing the user's login ID.

0.1 (2008-12-12)
----------------

- Initial release.
