==================
django-staticfiles
==================

This is a Django app that provides helpers for serving static files.

The main website for django-staticfiles is
`github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles`_ where you can also file tickets.

You can also install the `in-development version`_ of django-staticfiles with
``pip install django-staticfiles==dev`` or ``easy_install django-staticfiles==dev``.

.. warning:: With the adoption of django-staticfiles in Django >=1.3.X as a
   contrib app, the django-staticfiles 0.3.X series will be the last series
   to support Django 1.2.X and lower. Any new features will occur in
   later releases and target Django >=1.3.X though.
