django-staticfiles
==================

.. include:: ../README.rst

.. note:: When using ``django-staticfiles`` with your own apps, make sure
   they can be found by Django's app loading mechanism. Simply include
   a ``models`` module (an empty ``models.py`` file suffices) and add the
   app to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of your site.
