Roadmap
-------

1.4 
~~~

- this is not a good idea to replace link tag with img tags of all photos.
  If you have lots of photos it will make the browser die (I have done tests
  with 300 photos for collective.gallery. This is an issue.

- An other thing: you wake up all objects to build the template, you should
  consider use brains from catalog query. The new plone.app.imaging need
  object, but the old way (brain.getURL() + 'image_myscale' still works
  [toutpt]

Future
~~~~~~

- Re-use Plone's jQuery-lightbox code and CSS, if possible
- Integrate with other gallery products, if possible:

  * `collective.plonetruegallery`__
  * `Plone Slimbox`__
  * `collective.gallery`__

.. _plonetruegallery: http://plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery
__ plonetruegallery_
.. _slimbox: http://plone.org/products/plone-slimbox
__ slimbox_
.. _collective-gallery: http://plone.org/products/collective.gallery
