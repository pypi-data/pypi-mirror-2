        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.2 (2010-12-28)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed css registry entries [gborelli]
        
        
        0.2.1 (2010-11-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated Openlayers to 2.10 version
        
        
        0.2 (2010-10-31)
        ----------------
        * renamed cgeo-openlayers css and included in css registry [gborelli]
        * Added CSS for definition lists within the framed cloud popups,
          as used in collective.geo.kml
          [rockdj] 
        * Added ZCML registration for all skin subdirectories.  Without this,
          elements like the Edit toolbar don't appear when Plone isn't running
          in debug mode.
          [rockdj]
        * Updated OpenLayers.js to 2.8 (+styles and resources)
        * Register all browser pages and resources for IOpenLayers browser
          layer
        * Removed geo-point.js in favour of editing features provided by OpenLayers
        * Updated coordinate reference order to be consistent with WGS 1984 
          reference system.  This involves standardising the coordinate order
          to be [longitude, latitude] rather than [latitude, longitude].
          [rockdj]
        * Gave the Map element a relative position via CSS to allow Plone 
          drop-down menus to appear over the top (z-index doesn't apply 
          unless position is specified).
          [rockdj]
        * Added ZCML registration for 'img' and 'theme' skin subdirectories.
          Without registration, these folders are unable to be seen in Plone 
          and the OpenLayers controls don't appear. 
          [rockdj]
        * Added unit tests to ensure skin subdirectory registration works.
          [rockdj]
        
        0.1 (2009-06-19)
