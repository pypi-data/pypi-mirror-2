tiddlywebweb is a plugin for TiddlyWeb that allows the use
of a different TiddlyWeb instance as its datastore.

It has been created for several reasons:

* Because it is useful for doing things like interacting with
  TiddlyWeb on Google App Engine.
* To demonstrate the extensibility and flexibility of the TiddlyWeb
  system. Including "code A does not need to be near code B".
* To stimulate the creation a python-based client side library for
  accessing TiddlyWeb.
* To prove (as in test) the system.
* To enable a platform for performance testing.
* To confirm HTTP cache header handling.
* To do the luscious CSci wankery of self-hosting.

Once the package is installed, to use add the following to 
the tiddlywebconfig.py of an existing instance:

        'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.tiddlywebweb', {
            'server_base': 'http://0.0.0.0:8000',
        },

Set server_base to the URL (including server_prefix) of
the root (without the trailing /) of the target TiddlyWeb.

See pydoc tiddlywebplugins.tiddlywebweb for more details.

You can then do things like:

   twanager lbags

to list all the bags on the remote server. You can also start 
the local server, and interact via tiddlywebweb with the 
remote TiddlyWeb.

TODO:
* Authentication and Authorization handling very limited.
