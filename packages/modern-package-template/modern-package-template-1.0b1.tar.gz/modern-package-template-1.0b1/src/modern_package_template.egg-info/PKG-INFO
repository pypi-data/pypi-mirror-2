Description: modern-package-template
        =======================
        
        modern-package-template is a Paste template to create an initial layout for your
        Python projects using modern tools and practices followed in the Python
        community. Thus, your projects will have the following characteristics:
        
        1. Use Distribute_ instead of setuptools as the BDFL himself supports_ it.
        2. Buildout_ support, though you are not required to make use of it.
        3. ``README.txt`` and ``NEWS.txt`` automatically included in your package
        metadata as ``long_description``, thus making them appear in the PyPI_ page
        for your project.
        
        See the section titled "Roadmap" below for planned features.
        
        .. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/
        .. _Buildout: http://www.buildout.org/
        .. _supports: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-October/092678.html
        .. _Distribute: http://packages.python.org/distribute/
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        First install modern-package-template using PyPM_ or pip_:
        
        ::
        
        $ pypm install modern-package-template
        
        OR
        
        $ pip install modern-package-template
        
        .. _PyPM: http://pypm.activestate.com/
        .. _pip: http://pip.openplans.org/
        
        
        To create a Python project called "helloworld", run the following command in
        your terminal:
        
        ::
        
        $ paster create -t modern_package helloworld
        
        You could also, optionally, create namespace packages:
        
        ::
        
        $ paster create -t modern_package my.new.package package=my.new.package
        
        Once you create the project layout, the very first thing you must do is to
        review the contents of ``README.txt`` and edit it accordingly.
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        In the next release, I'd like to add support for Sphinx and Sphinx-PyPI-upload
        tool, so that developers can upload their sphinx-based documentation to
        packages.python.org without having to manually do it themselves.
        
        If you like, please help with working on one of the `new/open issues`_.
