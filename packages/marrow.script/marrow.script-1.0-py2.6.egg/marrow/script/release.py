name = "marrow.script"
version = "1.0"
release = "1.0"

summary = "Turn any callable into a powerful command line script through arglist introspection."
description = """The marrow.script package is a small library for turning average every-day
callables (such as functions and class methods) into command-line scripts
while automatically determining argument naming, typecasting, and generating
things like help and version information.  All behavior can be overridden by
you, the developer, giving you a flexible and easy to develop with command
line parsing library to replace ``optparse`` and ``argparse``.  This package
is not a wrapper around existing parsing libraries, and attempts to match the
syntax common to GNU software.

In a larger scope marrow.script aims to replace other high-level command-line
scripting libraries such as Paste Script and commandline while also
implementing Python 3 compatibility.
