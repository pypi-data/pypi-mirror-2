        Recipe for configuring a Solr instance
        **************************************
        
        .. contents::
        
        The recipe configures an instance of the Solr_ indexing server. Solr
        is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene_ Java
        search library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted
        search, caching, replication, and a web administration interface

        .. _Solr : http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
        .. _Lucene : http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html
        
        
        Note: This version of the recipe only supports Solr 1.4. Please use a release
        from the 0.x series if you are using Solr 1.3.
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        solr-location
            Path to the location of the Solr installation. This should be
            the top-level installation directory.
        
        host
            Name or IP address of the Solr server, e.g. some.server.com.
            Defaults to 'localhost'.
        
        port
            Server port. Defaults to 8983.
        
        basepath
            Base path to the Solr service on the server. The final URL to the
            Solr service will be made of
        
               ``$host:$port/$basepath``
        
            to which the actual commands will be appended. Defaults to '/solr'.
        
        config-destination
            Optional override for the directory where the ``solrconfig.xml``
            file will be generated. Defaults to the Solr default location.
        
        config-template
            Optional override for the template used to generate the ``solrconfig.xml``
            file. Defaults to the template contained in the recipe, i.e.
            ``templates/solrconfig.xml.tmpl``.
        
        schema-destination
            Optional override for the directory where the ``schema.xml`` file
            will be generated. Defaults to the Solr default location.
        
        schema-template
            Optional override for the template used to generate the ``schema.xml``
            file. Defaults to the template contained in the recipe, i.e.
            ``templates/schema.xml.tmpl``.
        
        jetty-destination
            Optional override for the directory where the ``jetty.xml`` file
            will be generated. Defaults to the Solr default location.
        
        extra-field-types
            Configure the extra field types available to be used in the
            ``index`` option. You can create custom field types with special
            analysers and tokenizers, check Solr's complete reference:
            http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters
        
        filter
            Configure the additional filters for the default field types.
            Each filter is configured on a separated line. Each line contains
            a ``index params`` pair, where ``index`` is one of the existing
            index types and ``params`` contains ``[key]:[value]`` items to
            configure the filter. Check the available filters in Solr's
            docs: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters#TokenFilterFactories
        
        index
            Configures the different types of index fields provided by the
            Solr instance. Each field is configured on a separated line. Each
            line contains a white-space separated list of ``[key]:[value]``
            pairs which define the index.
        
        unique-key
            Optional override for declaring a field to be unique for all documents.
            See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml for more information
            Defaults to 'uid'.
        
        default-search-field
            Configure a default search field, which is used when no field was
            explicitly given. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml.
        
        max-num-results
            The maximum number of results the Solr server returns. Defaults to 10.
        
        section-name
            Name of the product-config section to be generated for ``zope.conf``.
            Defaults to 'solr'.
        
        zope-conf
            Optional override for the configuration snippet that is generated to
            be included in ``zope.conf`` by other recipes. Defaults to::
        
                <product-config ${part:section-name}>
                    address ${part:host}:${part:port}
                    basepath ${part:basepath}
                </product-config>
        
        default-operator
            The default operator to use for queries.  Valid values or AND and OR.
            Defaults to OR.
        
        additional-solrconf
            Optional additional configuration to be included inside the
            solrconfig.xml. For instance, ``<requestHandler />`` directives.
        
        cacheSize
            Number of cache entries for the various caches (filterCache,
            fieldValueCache, queryResultCache and documentCache). Defaults to ``512``.
        
        maxWarmingSearchers
            Maximum number of searchers that may be warming in the background.
            Defaults to 4. For read-only slaves recommend to set to 1 or 2.
        
        useColdSearcher
            If a request comes in without a warm searcher available, immediately use
            one of the warming searchers to handle the request. Defaults to ``false``.
        
        autoCommitMaxDocs
            Let's you enable auto commit handling and force a commit after at least
            the number of documents were added. This is disabled by default.
        
        autoCommitMaxTime
            Let's you enable auto commit handling after a specified time in milli
            seconds. This is disabled by default.
        
        requestParsers-multipartUploadLimitInKB
            Optional ``<requestParsers />`` parameter useful if you are submitting
            very large documents to Solr. May be the case if Solr is indexing binaries
            extracted from request.
        
        vardir
            Optional override for the location of the directory where Solr
            stores its indexes and log files. Defaults to
            ``${buildout:directory}/var/solr``. This option and the ``script``
            option make it possible to create multiple Solr instances in a
            single buildout and dedicate one or more of the instances to
            automated functional testing.
        
        logdir 
           Optional override for the location of the Solr logfiles.
           Defaults to ``${buildout:directory}/var/solr``.
        
        script
            Optional override for the name of the generated Solr instance
            control script. Defaults to ``solr-instance``. This option and the
            ``vardir`` option make it possible to create multiple Solr
            instances in a single buildout and dedicate one or more of the
            instances to automated functional testing.
        
        java_opts
            Optional. Parameters to pass to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used to
        run Solr. Each option is specified on a separated line.
            For example::
        
                [solr-instance]
                ...
                java_opts =
                  -Xms512M
                  -Xmx1024M
                ...

        **************
        
        1.0b1 (2010-05-25)
        ==================
        
        - Added new ``autoCommitMaxDocs`` and ``autoCommitMaxTime`` options.
          [hannnosch]
        
        - ``logdir`` option internal bugfix: buildout does not allow ``None`` options
          values (__setitem__).
          [anguenot]
        
        1.0a7 (2010-05-17)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed syntax error in new logdir code.
          [ajung]
        
        1.0a6 (2010-05-17)
        ==================
        
        - Added ``logdir`` option.
          [ajung]
        
        1.0a5 (2010-05-11)
        ==================
        
        - Added more options: ``maxWarmingSearchers``, ``useColdSearcher`` and
          ``cacheSize``.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a4 (2010-05-05)
        ==================
        
        - Added back JMX configuration. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrJmx for
          more details. You can enable it by adding ``-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote``
          to the ``java_opts`` option.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a3 (2010-03-23)
        ==================
        
        - Added back a field type called ``integer`` with the same properties as the
          ``int`` type. This ensures basic schemas created by ``collective.solr`` won't
          need any schema changes, though they still need a full reindex.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a2 (2010-03-22)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed invalid reStructuredText format in the changelog.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a1 (2010-03-22)
        ==================
        
        - Replaced the ``gettableFiles`` option in the admin section with the new
          ``*.admin.ShowFileRequestHandler`` approach. By default your entire
          ``SOLR_HOME/conf`` except for the ``scripts.conf`` is exposed.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated the default ``schema.xml`` to the Solr 1.4 format. The schema version
          is now ``1.2`` instead of ``1.1``. The schema is no longer compatible with
          Solr 1.3. Please use a recipe version from the 0.x series for that.
        
          Changes to the schema include:
        
          * The integer field is now called int.
        
          * New field type attribute ``omitTermFreqAndPositions`` introduced. This is
            true by default except for text fields.
        
          * New binary and random field types.
        
          * The int, float, long, double and date fields now use the ``solr.Trie*``
            classes. These are more efficient in general.
        
          * New tint, tfloat, tlong, tdouble and tdate fields. These are ``solr.Trie*``
            fields with a precisionStep configured. You can use them for fields that
            see a lot of range queries.
        
          * The old sint, slong, sfloat and sdouble fields are no longer configured.
        
          * The examples fields text_greek, textTight and alphaOnlySort are no longer
            configured by default.
        
          * The text field uses the SnowballPorterFilterFactory with a language of
            English instead of the EnglishPorterFilterFactory.
        
          * The ignored field is now multiValued.
        
          * No dynamic fields are configured by default.
        
          If you have an older Solr 1.3 configuration, you might need to adjust it to
          match some of the new defaults. You will also have to do a full reindex of
          Solr, if the type of any of the fields changed, like with int or date fields.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Simplify solrconfig.xml and unconfigure example handlers that rely on a
          specific schema. Other changes include:
        
          * Indexes are now flushed when the ramBufferSizeMB is exceeded, defaulting to
            32mb instead of every 1000 documents. The maxBufferedDocs is deprecated.
        
          * The new reopenReaders option causes IndexReaders to be reopened instead of
            closed and then opened.
        
          * The filterCache uses the solr.FastLRUCache instead of the solr.LRUCache.
        
          * The queryResultWindowSize defaults to 30 instead of 10.
        
          * The requestHandler use the new solr.SearchHandler, which supports a
            defType argument to turn it into a dismax handler, instead of having two
            separate classes for the two handlers.
        
          There is a number of new handlers in Solr 1.4, which aren't enabled by
          default. Read the Solr documentation for the examples.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated jetty.xml and solrconfig.xml to Solr 1.4 defaults. The
          ``*.jetty.Request.maxFormContentSize`` has been set to allow post request of
          1mb by default.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made the tests pass again, by installing more packages into the test buildout
          environment.
          [hannosch]
        
        0.4 (2010-02-18)
        ================
        
        - Some package metadata cleanup.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added optional java_opts parameter to pass to the Java Virtual
          Machine (JVM) used to run Solr.
          [anguenot]
        
        - Fixed to create the ``solr.log`` file inside the ``log`` folder.
          [deo]
        
        - Made sure to display the invalid index attribute name when raising
          the related error.
          [deo]
        
        - Added support for defining custom field types.
          [deo]
        
        - Added a ``restart`` command to the solr instance control script.
          [deo]
        
        
        0.3 (2009-09-10)
        ================
        
        - Added requestParsers-multipartUploadLimitInKB allowing one to
          adjust the request parsers limit.
          [anguenot]
        
        - Added additional-solrconfig allowing one to extend the solrconfig.xml.
          [anguenot]
        
        - Support whitespace in schema index attributes values.
          [anguenot]
        
        - Added default-operator.
          [swampmonkey]
        
        - Added config-template for allowing an alternate template to be used for
          generating the solrconfig.xml file.
          [cguardia]
        
        - Added the ``vardir`` and ``script`` options, making it possible to
          install multiple Solr instances in a single buildout.
          [hathawsh]
        
        
        0.2 (2008-08-08)
        ================
        
        - Improved stop command by using SIGTERM instead of SIGHUP.
          [guido_w]
        
        - Made that stdout and stderr get redirected to a log file when daemonizing
          the solr instance.
          [guido_w]
        
        - Added support for setting Solr filters.
          [deo]
        
        
        0.1 (2008-07-07)
        ================
        
        - First public release.
