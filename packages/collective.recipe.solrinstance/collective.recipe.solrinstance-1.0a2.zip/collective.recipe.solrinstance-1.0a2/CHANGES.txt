1.0a2 (2010-03-22)
==================

- Fixed invalid reStructuredText format in the changelog.
  [hannosch]

1.0a1 (2010-03-22)
==================

- Replaced the ``gettableFiles`` option in the admin section with the new
  ``*.admin.ShowFileRequestHandler`` approach. By default your entire
  ``SOLR_HOME/conf`` except for the ``scripts.conf`` is exposed.
  [hannosch]

- Updated the default ``schema.xml`` to the Solr 1.4 format. The schema version
  is now ``1.2`` instead of ``1.1``. The schema is no longer compatible with
  Solr 1.3. Please use a recipe version from the 0.x series for that.

  Changes to the schema include:

  * The integer field is now called int.

  * New field type attribute ``omitTermFreqAndPositions`` introduced. This is
    true by default except for text fields.

  * New binary and random field types.

  * The int, float, long, double and date fields now use the ``solr.Trie*``
    classes. These are more efficient in general.

  * New tint, tfloat, tlong, tdouble and tdate fields. These are ``solr.Trie*``
    fields with a precisionStep configured. You can use them for fields that
    see a lot of range queries.

  * The old sint, slong, sfloat and sdouble fields are longer configured.

  * The examples fields text_greek, textTight and alphaOnlySort are no longer
    configured by default.

  * The text field uses the SnowballPorterFilterFactory with a language of
    English instead of the EnglishPorterFilterFactory.

  * The ignored field is now multiValued.

  * No dynamic fields are configured by default.

  If you have an older Solr 1.3 configuration, you might need to adjust it to
  match some of the new defaults. You will also have to do a full reindex of
  Solr, if the type of any of the fields changed, like with int or date fields.
  [hannosch]

- Simplify solrconfig.xml and unconfigure example handlers that rely on a
  specific schema. Other changes include:

  * Indexes are now flushed when the ramBufferSizeMB is exceeded, defaulting to
    32mb instead of every 1000 documents. The maxBufferedDocs is deprecated.

  * The new reopenReaders option causes IndexReaders to be reopened instead of
    closed and then opened.

  * The filterCache uses the solr.FastLRUCache instead of the solr.LRUCache.

  * The queryResultWindowSize defaults to 30 instead of 10.

  * The requestHandler use the new solr.SearchHandler, which supports a
    defType argument to turn it into a dismax handler, instead of having two
    separate classes for the two handlers.

  There is a number of new handlers in Solr 1.4, which aren't enabled by
  default. Read to the Solr documentation for the examples.
  [hannosch]

- Updated jetty.xml and solrconfig.xml to Solr 1.4 defaults. The
  ``*.jetty.Request.maxFormContentSize`` has been set to allow post request of
  1mb by default.
  [hannosch]

- Made the tests pass again, by installing more packages into the test buildout
  environment.
