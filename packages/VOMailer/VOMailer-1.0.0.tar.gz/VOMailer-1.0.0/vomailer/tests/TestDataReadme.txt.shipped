In order for the test script to work properly you need to provide test data.

The data is stored in the ./test subdirectory

The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps.

1. Go to your VOlunteer Ottawa volunteer postings.
2. apply for some or ALL of the volunteer positions using your own personal email
3. These applications will be sent to you.
4. In your email program (clients like Evolution, Thunderbird or MS Outlook) select each message and save as text file (should use *.mail for extension).
5. Copy all saved applications to the ..../vomailer/tests folder.
6. open them in a simple text editor to ensure there is content. 
    * If the first line looks like:

    * Then there should be a bunch of funky stuff that looks to a be bunch of code at the top like:

8. Then you have what you need. If there is not all this code then you need to try to save the e-mail as RAW text. The script will parse all this lovely information and work some magic.
9. You now have your own test data.
