# What

HTTPretty is a HTTP client mock library for Python 100% inspired on ruby's [FakeWeb](http://fakeweb.rubyforge.org/)

# Motivation

When building systems that access external resources such as RESTful
webservices, XMLRPC or even simple HTTP requests, we stumble in the
problem:

    "I'm gonna need to mock all those requests"

It brings a lot of hassle, you will need to use a generic mocking
tool, mess with scope and so on.

## The idea behind HTTPretty (how it works)

HTTPretty [monkey matches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch)
Python's [socket](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html) core
module, reimplementing the HTTP protocol, by mocking requests and
responses.

This is a nice thing, if you consider that all python http modules
are supposed to get mocked.

# Usage

## expecting a simple response body

```python
from httpretty import HTTPretty
HTTPretty.register_uri(HTTPretty.GET, "http://globo.com/",
                       body="The biggest portal in Brazil")

fd = urllib2.urlopen('http://globo.com')
got = fd.read()
fd.close()

print got
```

**:: output ::**

    The biggest portal in Brazil

## rotating responses

same URL, same request method, the first request return the first
HTTPretty.Response, all the subsequent ones return the last (status
202)

```python
HTTPretty.register_uri(HTTPretty.GET, "http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty",
                       responses=[
                           HTTPretty.Response(body="first response", status=201),
                           HTTPretty.Response(body='second and last response', status=202),
                        ])

request1 = urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty')
body1 = request1.read()
request1.close()

assert that(request1.code).equals(201)
assert that(body1).equals('first response')

request2 = urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty')
body2 = request2.read()
request2.close()
assert that(request2.code).equals(202)
assert that(body2).equals('second and last response')

request3 = urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty')
body3 = request3.read()
request3.close()
assert that(request3.code).equals(202)
assert that(body3).equals('second and last response')
```

# Documentation

## expect for a response, and check the request got by the "server" to make sure it was fine.

```python
from httpretty import HTTPretty
from httplib2 import Http

HTTPretty.register_uri(HTTPretty.PATCH, "http://api.github.com/",
                       body='{"repositories": ["HTTPretty", "lettuce"]}')

client = Http()
headers, body = client.request('http://api.github.com', 'PATCH',
                               body='{"username": "gabrielfalcao"}',
                               headers={
                                   'content-type': 'text/json',
                               })
assert body == '{"repositories": ["HTTPretty", "lettuce"]}'
assert HTTPretty.last_request.method == 'PATCH'
assert HTTPretty.last_request.headers['content-type'] == 'text/json'
```
