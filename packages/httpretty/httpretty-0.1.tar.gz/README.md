# What

HTTPretty is a HTTP client mock library for Python 100% inspired on ruby's [FakeWeb](http://fakeweb.rubyforge.org/)

# Motivation

When building systems that access external resources such as RESTful
webservices, XMLRPC or even simple HTTP requests, we stumble in the
problem:

    "I'm gonna need to mock all those requests"

It brings a lot of hassle, you will need to use a generic mocking
tool, mess with scope and so on.

## The idea behind HTTPretty (how it works)

HTTPretty [monkey matches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch)
Python's [socket](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html) core
module, reimplementing the HTTP protocol, by mocking requests and
responses.

This is a nice thing, if you consider that all python http modules
are supposed to get mocked.

# Usage

    from httpretty import HTTPretty
    HTTPretty.register_uri(HTTPretty.GET, "http://globo.com/",
                           body="The biggest portal in Brazil")

    fd = urllib2.urlopen('http://globo.com')
    got = fd.read()
    fd.close()

    print got

**:: output ::**

    The biggest portal in Brazil
