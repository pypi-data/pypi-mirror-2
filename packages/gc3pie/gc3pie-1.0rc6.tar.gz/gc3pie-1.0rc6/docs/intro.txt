 Introduction

GC3Libs is a python package for controlling the life-cycle of a Grid
or batch computational job.

GC3Libs provides services for submitting computational jobs to Grids
and batch systems, controlling their execution, persisting job
information, and retrieving the final output.

GC3Libs takes an application-oriented approach to batch computing. A
generic `Application` class provides the basic operations for
controlling remote computations, but different `Application`
subclasses can expose adapted interfaces, focusing on the most
relevant aspects of the application being represented.

This document is the technical reference for the GC3Libs programming
model, aimed at programmers who want to use GC3Libs to implement
computational workflows in Python.
