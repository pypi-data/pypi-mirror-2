	MULTITAPER SPECTRUM LIBRARY

VERSION 2.01
LAST MODIFIED: 
	APRIL 2008

The multitaper spectral analysis library is a Fortran 90 library 
for multitaper spectral analysis of univariate and multivariate 
problems, as explained in Prieto et al. (2008). 

The library has been extensively tested but is made available 
without warranty. Users of the software are free to make modifications
to the programs to meet their particular needs, but are asked not to
distribute modified code to others.  Tell us about your improvements
and bug fixes, and we will add them to the code for everyone's benefit.

COMPILING

This release contains a Makefile that will compile the entire set of
libraries and programs as explained in the documentation. The folder
makefiles/ contains other makefiles to compile with other F90 
compilers (ifort, G95, gfortran) or using the Sun F90 compiler (f90). 

To compile just type 

> make

and the libraries mwlib.a, gplot.a will be compiled in folder libraries/
modules will be compiled to the modules/ folder
and interactive programs will be compiled in folder programs/.

We have tested with different compiler versions and various computer
systems (Mac OS X, Sun and Linux) and no modification should be necesary.
Just use the appropriate Makefile from the list in the makefiles/ folder.  


PLOTTING

I added to the new release on-the-fly plotting routines. This allows 
the plotting of results from the interactive programs. For plotting to 
work you need to have plotxy installed. The source code is available
in folder /plot/plotprogram/. This code generates PostScript figures
that need to be viewed using Ghostview (gv). Both plotxy and gv need 
to be in your path for on-the-fly plotting to work.
