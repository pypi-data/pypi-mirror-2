    - Fixed edge cases in which non-significant newlines/tabs could
      end up in the .po file.
    - Added support for string-array.
    - New "init" command, which expands on "export --initial", and
      can also be used to initialize arbitrary new languages.
    - Support for configuration files, and a whole slew of nice
      options, like the ability to ignore messages.
    - Nicer output.
    - Decent test coverage, we're getting there.
