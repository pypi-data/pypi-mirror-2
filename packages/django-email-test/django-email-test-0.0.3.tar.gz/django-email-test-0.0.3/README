= Django Email Test =

A simple app for sending test emails via Django's admin site.

== Usage ==
Put 'django_email_test' in INSTALLED_APPS, then run syncdb.

In the admin site index, go down to where it says "Django Email Test" and add a TestEmail. When the model is saved for the first time, Django will attempt to send an email. If any errors occur when sending the email, they'll be stored on the model.
