Description: 
        PYthon SHell ADApter to simplify calling shell commands from Python
        code.  Calling shell commands is usually tedious, especially transfer
        data between Python and shell domain. Creating a pipeline to call
        several external tools in Python code is not as simple as shell
        command doing. It is also hard to passing variables between domains,
        you need tediously string joining/formatting and parsing.  PyShada
        tries to help you for calling shell commands.
