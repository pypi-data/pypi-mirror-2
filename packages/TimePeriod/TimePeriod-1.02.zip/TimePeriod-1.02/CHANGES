Version 1.02:
    * Bug: "none" matching nothing (formerly it matched everything).
    * Bug: Inverted year ranges (e.g. 2015-2010) are now equivalent to standard
      formatted ranges.
    * Bug: "12pm" and "12am" are handled correctly for hours now.
    * Bug: Empty ranges (e.g. "wk {}") are no longer an error, but they never
      match.
    * Bug: The week number calculation is fixed:
        - Previously, the days 1-7 would be the first week, 8-14 would be the
          second week, etc.
        - Now, it counts the number of Sunday's that have passed.
