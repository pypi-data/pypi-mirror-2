Introduction
============

*Products.JYUDynaPage* is a replacement to old *mxmDynamicPage* product for Plone 3.
DynaPage content type is like normal page content type, but it has easily configurable
lists (well at least easier than collections are) which can be placed below or above 
the normal page content. List items can consist any Plone content found from catalog.

Products.JYUDynaPage contains also migration script to migrate data from old mxmDynamicPage-
product to Products.JYUDynaPage.
