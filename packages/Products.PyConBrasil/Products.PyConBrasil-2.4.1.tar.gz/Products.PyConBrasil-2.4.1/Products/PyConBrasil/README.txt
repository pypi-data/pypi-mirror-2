======================
PythonBrasil
======================

This software was writen to manage the papers and registration for
PythonBrasil (formerly known as PyConBrasil), the Brazilian Python
Conference.

It doesn't means, though, that you can't use it to manage you're own
conference! :o)

The motivation to start this product came from the insistency of Erico
Andrei, in the first preparation meeting for the II PythonBrasil (2006),
where he stated that we should do it in Python and make it available
to everyone who did the registration in the event.

And he was right about it... ;-)
