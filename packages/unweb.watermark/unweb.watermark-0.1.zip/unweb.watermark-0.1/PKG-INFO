Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        unweb.watermark lets you protect your high resolution images while publishing 
        resized and watermarked versions. The original images will only be available 
        to users with the "Licensee" role.
        
        Add it to your instance eggs in buildout and install using the Plone Add-ons 
        panel. 
        
        Go to the "Watermark settings" configuration panel and set a watermark image.
        
        Then upload your hi-res images normally. The default Plone workflow will be 
        applied. Whenever you publish an image, the original file will be transfered to
        a protected image field and the watermarked and resize image will be displayed
        in the default image field. If you retract the image then the original file
        will replace the watermarked one.
