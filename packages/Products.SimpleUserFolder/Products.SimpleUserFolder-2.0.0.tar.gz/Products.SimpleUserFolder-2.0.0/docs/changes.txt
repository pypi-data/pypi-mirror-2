---------------------------

Version 1.1.0 (14 Mar 2004)
---------------------------

- Added the ability to give users extra attributes.
  These are accessed by supplying them in
  :meth:`getUserDetails` and then using the user's :meth:`__getitem__`
  interface.

- Changed case of NAME, PASSWORD and ROLE to
  name, password and role for Z SQL implementations

- Made Simple User Folder instances ObjectManagers.
  This means configuration methods can now be put in
  the Simpler User Folder, rather than the 
  Simple User Folder's container

- Renamed :meth:`getUserNames` configuration method to
  :meth:`getUserIds` to avoid a name clash brought on
  by the addition of ObjectManager functionality

- Catered for :meth:`getUserDetails` raising an exception or 
  returning rubbish in a graceful way

- Documented and tested for the case where :meth:`editUser` is 
  called with a password of None

- Enabled :class:`UsageBase` class to test implementations that
  stored encrypted passwords

- Tidied up tests, SQL tests in particular
