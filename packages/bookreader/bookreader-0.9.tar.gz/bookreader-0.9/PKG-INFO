Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a book reading UI application for items that have been deposited in a 
        DSpace repository that has the OAI-PMH repository views enabled.
        
        Using the bookreader
        ====================
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Package
        _______
        
        Install the ``bookreader`` Python package by doing one of the following:
        
        - Adding it to your list of eggs in buildout.cfg and running ``bin/buildout``
        - Use ``easy_install bookreader`` to install it globally
        - Download the source code, unpack it and run ``python setup.py install``
        
        Django
        ______
        
        In your project's settings.py, add ``bookreader`` to the list of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` 
        and run ``manage.py syncdb`` to add the tables to the database. Then include 
        ``bookreader.urls`` in your url patterns. Last, you will need to add the base 
        URL for your Djatoka server in your settings file as ``DJATOKA_BASE_URL``.
        
        Administration
        --------------
        
        The bookreader uses the Django admin interface for the manipulation of the data.
        First, you must add a *Repository*. The only input required is the OAI-PMH server
        url of your DSpace repository. Using that url, Django will connect to the server
        and query for its name. Then collections can be added by DSpace handle. Once a 
        handle is entered, Django will query the server to validate that it is a valid 
        handle and query for the name of the collection. At this point, it will also query
        for all books (items) in the collection and harvest the metadata and pages for 
        those books. This automatic behavior can be disabled by setting 
        ``BOOKREADER_SIGNALS_ENABLED`` to False in your settings.
        
        
        DSpace Requirements
        ===================
        
        Item and Bitstream Layout
        -------------------------
        
        For the use case of this Django UI, books are DSpace items and pages are 
        bitstreams attached to those book items. The page bitstreams must be JPEG2000 
        files in the 'ORIGINAL' or main content bundle. Thumbnails can be provided for 
        each page by adding a jpeg file in a 'THUMBNAILS' bundle that has the same base 
        filename as the original page bitstream. For example, if the page bitstream 
        filename is ``tamu_pl_0001.jpf`` then the thumbnail must end with ``tamu_pl_0001.jpg``.
        In this case ``thumbs/tamu_pl_0001.jpg`` would also be acceptable.
        
        OAI-PMH Repository
        ------------------
        
        In order for the data be harvested, the DSpace OAI-PMH server must have the 
        ``ORE`` and ``DIM`` metadata prefixes enabled and compatible crosswalks installed
        for the books.
        
        Metadata Fields
        ---------------
        
        DIM data
        ________
        
        The DIM metadata prefix is used to gather the book (item) metadata. The fields 
        are harvested using the `pyoai <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyoai>`_ ``MetadataReader``
        that is extended in the Python `dspace <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dspace>`_ 
        library, ``NestedMetadataReader``. XPath evaluators are used to map xml elements
        to fields. For the current mapping, see ``bookreader.harvesting.metadata.dim_reader``.
        
        ORE data
        ________
        
        The ORE metadata prefix is used to gather the page and link (bitstream) metadata.
        The bitstream URL, title, and bundle are all gathered from the ORE xml document.
        
        Canonical Items
        ===============
        
        Starting with version 0.3, a new canonical items requirement was added. The 
        list of bitstreams is checked for an additional bitstream in the 'METADATA' 
        bundle that is named ``bitstream_metadata.xml``. This file is then parsed for 
        a repository url of a canonical version of the book as well as additional 
        metadata about the page bitstreams so that missing pages can be marked for 
        future reference/use. See the schema at ``docs/bitstream_metadata.xsd`` for more 
        reference on the format.

        =======
        
        0.9 (2011-03-29)
        ----------------
        * Switching to a 'type' field to support multiple book forms (canonical, 
          franken, extant and work). South data and schema migrations provided.
        * Detailed pages view now supports a jp2 url in the request to select the 
          current page
        * Added SWORD client configuration parameters to the repository
        * Switched URL to base_url and oai_path for OAI client to match the changes in
          the DSpace client
        * Added published flag to books
        * Added view to publish books over SWORD
        * Added ability to add books (except for extant books)

        * Added is_canonical attribute to accommodate feature requests
        * Updated CanonicalSelectionForm to use new is_canonical attribute
        * Tests for canonical flag in bitstream metadata files

        0.7 (2010-11-12)
        ----------------
        
        * Added a redirecting print view

          internal
