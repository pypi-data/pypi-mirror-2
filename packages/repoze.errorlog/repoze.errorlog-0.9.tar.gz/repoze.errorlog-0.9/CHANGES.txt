0.9 (2010-05-23)
----------------

- Bump copyrights.

- Remove dependency on ``ez_setup.py``.

- Docs now show how to use ``ErrorLog`` outside PasteDeploy.

- Avoid a dependency on `elementtree` when used with Python 2.5 and later.
  In those Python versions we used the built-in xml.etree support.

- 100% test coverage.

0.8 (2008-06-25)
----------------

- Remove post-mortem debug middleware (moved to repoze.debug).

- Initial PyPI release.

0.7 (2008-05-21)
----------------

- Add post-mortem debug middleware (egg:repoze.errorlog#pdbpm)

- Remove versions from dependencies.

0.6
---

- Get rid of find-link point to http://dist.repoze.org in setup.py.

- Bump ez_setup.py version.

0.5
---

- Depend on elementree 1.2.6 explicitly.

0.4
---

- Add 'ignore' feature to configuration.  A value consisting of
  space-separated entry point names can be used here, indicating that
  these exception types should not be logged or kept in exception
  history.

- Allow __error_log__ view path to be configured via 'path' entry in
  Paste configuration.

- Place 'repoze.errorlog.path' and 'repoze.errorlog.entryid' in the
  WSGI environment to allow error-catching middleware and apps to
  compose URLs to errors.

0.3
---

- 0.2 didn't work as a filter. :-(

- Don't use zope.pagetemplate, it has too many (potentially
  conflicting) dependencies.  Instead use meld for template views.

0.2
---

- Provide a TTW view (accessible via '/__error_log__') of recent
  tracebacks.

0.1
---

- Initial release.
