        -------------------
        Python egg releaser
        -------------------
        
        **mkrelease** is a no-frills Python egg releaser. It was created to take
        the cumber out of building and distributing Python eggs.
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Here at Jarn, we use zc.buildout and pinned egg versions for
        customer deployments. This means that for every update, we have to make
        proper egg releases of all modified packages.
        
        Turns out it's quite a bit of work to put a new egg on a
        distribution server! After preparing a package for release (update
        version strings, etc) we typically have to:
        
        1. Commit modified files.
        
        2. Tag the release.
        
        3. Package up an egg.
        
        4. Distribute the egg via scp or upload it to an index server.
        
        Now multiply by the number of packages waiting for release, and the moment of
        *I gotta script this* approaches at warp 9.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        mkrelease requires Python 2.6 for its improved distutils support. Use
        ``easy_install jarn.mkrelease`` to install the ``mkrelease`` script.
        Then put it on your system PATH by e.g. symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.
        
        mkrelease is known to work with the 0.6 series of setuptools (0.6c11)
        and distribute (0.6.10).
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``mkrelease [options] [scm-url|scm-sandbox]``
        
        Options
        =======
        
        ``-C, --no-commit``
        Do not commit modified files from the sandbox.
        
        ``-T, --no-tag``
        Do not tag the release in SCM.
        
        ``-S, --no-upload``
        Do not upload the release to dist-location.
        
        ``-n, --dry-run``
        Dry-run; equivalent to ``-CTS``.
        
        ``--svn, --hg, --git``
        Select the SCM type. Only required if the SCM type
        cannot be guessed from the argument.
        
        ``-d dist-location, --dist-location=dist-location``
        An scp destination specification, or an index server
        configured in ``~/.pypirc``, or an alias name for either.
        This option may be specified more than once.
        
        ``-s, --sign``
        Sign the release with GnuPG.
        
        ``-i identity, --identity=identity``
        The GnuPG identity to sign with.
        
        ``-p, --push``
        Push changes upstream (Mercurial and Git.)
        
        ``-e, --develop``
        Allow version number extensions (i.e. don't ignore
        respective setup.cfg options.)
        
        ``-b, --binary``
        Release a binary (bdist) egg.
        
        ``-q, --quiet``
        Suppress output of setuptools commands.
        
        ``-h, --help``
        Print the help message and exit.
        
        ``-v, --version``
        Print the version string and exit.
        
        ``scm-url``
        The URL of a remote SCM repository.
        
        ``scm-sandbox``
        A local SCM sandbox; defaults to the current working
        directory.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Release my.package, using version information from its ``setup.py``,
        and distribute it to the default location::
        
        $ mkrelease https://svn.jarn.com/public/my.package/trunk
        
        The same as above, but release the contents of the SCM sandbox in
        ``src/my.package``::
        
        $ mkrelease src/my.package
        
        Release my.package and distribute it via scp to
        ``jarn.com:/var/dist/public``::
        
        $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/public src/my.package
        
        Release my.package and upload it to PyPI::
        
        $ mkrelease -d pypi src/my.package
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        mkrelease reads available index servers from the distutils configuration
        file ``~/.pypirc``. How this file must look is documented elsewhere_.
        
        mkrelease furthermore reads its own configuration file
        ``~/.mkrelease``. Here's an example::
        
        [defaults]
        distbase =
        distdefault = public
        
        [aliases]
        public =
        jarn.com:/var/dist/public
        customerA =
        jarn.com:/var/dist/customerA
        world =
        public
        pypi
        
        (Note that ``pypi`` refers to the index server `pypi` as configured in
        ``~/.pypirc``. More on this later.)
        
        Armed with the above configuration we can shorten example 3 to::
        
        $ mkrelease -d public src/my.package
        
        And, because ``public`` is the default location, we can omit ``-d`` entirely::
        
        $ mkrelease src/my.package
        
        .. _elsewhere: http://docs.python.org/distutils/packageindex.html#the-pypirc-file
        
        Working with scp
        ================
        
        The simplest distribution location is a server directory shared through
        Apache. Releasing an egg means scp-ing it to the appropriate place on the
        server::
        
        $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/public src/my.package
        
        We have a distribution point for every project, so customer A does not
        see customer B's releases::
        
        $ mkrelease -d jarn.com:/var/dist/customerB src/my.package
        
        Typing the full destination every time is tedious, even setting up an alias
        for each and every customer is, so we configure distbase instead::
        
        [defaults]
        distbase = jarn.com:/var/dist
        distdefault = public
        
        [aliases]
        world =
        public
        pypi
        
        The distbase is prepended if an scp destination does not contain a
        host part. We can now write::
        
        $ mkrelease -d public src/my.package
        $ mkrelease -d customerB src/my.package
        
        Working with index servers
        ==========================
        
        Another way of distributing Python eggs is by uploading to dedicated
        index servers, notably PyPI. We first need a ``~/.pypirc`` file::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        
        [pypi]
        username = fred
        password = secret
        
        To release a package on PyPI we can now type::
        
        $ mkrelease -d pypi src/my.package
        
        Index servers are not limited to PyPI though.
        For example, in the Plone world it is common practice to upload packages to
        plone.org as well as PyPI. Let's extend our ``~/.pypirc``::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        ploneorg
        
        [pypi]
        username = fred
        password = secret
        
        [ploneorg]
        repository = http://plone.org/products
        username = fred
        password = secret
        
        This allows us to write::
        
        $ mkrelease -d pypi -d ploneorg src/my.package
        
        Finally, we can group the servers by defining an alias in ``~/.mkrelease``::
        
        [aliases]
        plone =
        pypi
        ploneorg
        
        And type::
        
        $ mkrelease -d plone src/my.package
        
        Note: Due to the way setuptools works, the egg is rebuilt for every index
        server it is uploaded to. This means that MD5 sums and GnuPG signatures will
        differ between servers. If this is not what you want, upload to only one
        server and distribute from there by other means (e.g. replication).
        
        Releasing a tag
        ===============
        
        Release my.package from an existing tag::
        
        $ mkrelease -T https://svn.jarn.com/public/my.package/tags/1.0
        
        Only Subversion allows us to specify the tag as part of the URL. With
        Mercurial and Git we need a local working copy, switched to the tag
        we want to release::
        
        $ git checkout -f 1.0
        $ mkrelease -T
        
        Using GnuPG
        ===========
        
        Release my.package and sign the archive with GnuPG (the ``gpg``
        command must be available on the system PATH)::
        
        $ mkrelease -s -i fred@bedrock.com -d pypi src/my.package
        
        The ``-i`` flag is entirely optional, and GnuPG will pick your default
        key if not given. In addition, defaults for ``-s`` and ``-i`` may be
        configured in ``~/.mkrelease``::
        
        [defaults]
        sign = yes
        identity = fred@bedrock.com
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        The following commands must be available on the system PATH (you only need
        what you plan to use):
        
        * svn
        
        * hg
        
        * git
        
        * scp
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        Subversion
        ----------
        
        The release tag can only be created if the package follows the
        standard Subversion repository layout: ``package.name/trunk``,
        ``package.name/branches``, and ``package.name/tags``.
        If you have a non-standard repository, you must tag by hand
        and run mkrelease with the ``-T`` option.
        
        Git
        ---
        
        Git's short-hand notation for ``ssh://`` URLs is not supported.

        2.0.2 - 2009-08-29
        ------------------
        
        - Filter meta files (``.svn*``, ``.hg*``, ``.git*``) and never include
        them in releases.
        [stefan]
        
        - Make sure to clean up all temporary files.
        [stefan]

        files (Symptom: data files not installed).
        [stefan]
        
        - The -e flag now implies -T. We never want to tag a development release.
        [stefan]
        
        2.0 - 2009-07-16
        ----------------
        
        - Allow command line options to appear after the argument. As in:
        ``mkrelease src/my.package -q -d pypi``.
        [stefan]
        
        2.0b2 - 2009-07-09
        ------------------
        
        - Improve user feedback in the SCM-detection part.
        [stefan]
        
        - Document the -e flag.
        [stefan]
        
        - Drop global configuration file for YAGNI.
        [stefan]
        
        - Allow to set default values for -s and -i in ~/.mkrelease.
        [stefan]
        
        2.0b1 - 2009-07-03
        ------------------
        
        - By default, ignore all version number extensions (dev-r12345)
        that may be configured in setup.cfg. Passing the -e flag
        disables this safeguard.
        [witsch, stefan]
        
        - Delete any existing signature file before signing anew. This keeps
        GnuPG from complaining about existing (but left-over) files.
        [stefan]
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-06-27
        ------------------
        
        - Drop configurable Python and use sys.executable. This also means we
        now require Python 2.6.
        [stefan]
        
        - Force setuptools to only use file-finders for the selected SCM type.
        This is required to support multi-SCM sandboxes (think git-svn).
        [stefan]
        
        - Treat Subversion sandboxes just like the others and avoid the
        temporary checkout step.
        [stefan]
        
        - Remove the -u flag for being pointless.
        [stefan]
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-06-14
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for Mercurial and Git.
        [stefan]
        
        - Added 250+ unit tests.
        [stefan]
        
        1.0.2 - 2009-06-13
        ------------------
        
        - Documented long options.
        [stefan]
        
        - Print a "Tagging ..." line before tagging.
        [stefan]
        
        1.0 - 2009-05-14
        ----------------
        
        - Print help and version to stdout, not stderr.
        [stefan]
        
        1.0b4 - 2009-04-30
        ------------------
        
        - Since distutils commands may return 0, successful or not, we must
        check their output for signs of failure.
        [stefan]
        
        - Allow to pass argument list to ``main()``.
        [stefan]
        
        1.0b3 - 2009-03-23
        ------------------
        
        - No longer depend on grep.
        [stefan]
        
        - Use subprocess.Popen instead of os.system and os.popen.
        [stefan]
        
        - Protect against infinite alias recursion.
        [stefan]
        
        - Drop -z option and always create zip files from now on.
        [stefan]
        
        1.0b2 - 2009-03-19
        ------------------
        
        - Checkin everything that's been modified, not just "relevant" files.
        [stefan]
        
        - Expand aliases recursively.
        [stefan]
        
        1.0b1 - 2009-03-18
        ------------------
        
        - The distbase and distdefault config file options no longer have
        default values.
        [stefan]
        
        - Read index servers from ~/.pypirc and allow them to be used with -d.
        [stefan]
        
        - The -d option may be specified more than once.
        [stefan]
        
        - Dropped -p option. Use -d pypi instead.
        [stefan]
        
        - Dropped -c option. If your have non-standard SVN repositories you must
        tag by hand.
        [stefan]
        
        0.19 - 2009-02-23
        -----------------
        
        - Absolute-ize the temp directory path.
        [stefan]
        
        0.18 - 2009-01-26
        -----------------
        
        - Include README.txt and CHANGES.txt in long_description.
        [stefan]
        
        - Rid unused imports and locals.
        [stefan]
        
        0.17 - 2009-01-23
        -----------------
        
        - Add -c option to enable codespeak support. The codespeak.net repository
        uses ``branch`` and ``tag`` instead of ``branches`` and ``tags``.
        [gotcha, stefan]
        
        0.16 - 2009-01-13
