========================================
History for Products.ATVocabularyManager
========================================

2011-02-22 1.6
==============

* dont fetch version and shortdesc from metadata.xml - this is wrong. [jensens] 

2011-02-18 1.6.0a2
==================

* changed method of dermining if LinguaPlone is installed. Asking QI does not
  work in Plone4 [naro]

* added some missing dependencies, and a new extra section to setup.py.
  This helps to get a simple buildout cfg for testing against plone4 [do3cc]

* added some sleeps between installs in the tests, else genericsetup
  creates ids twice, and fails [do3cc]

* temporary deactivated two checks in the tests. With
  Products.CMFQuickInstaller>=3.0.3, the portal_vocabularies don't get
  deleted during uninstall [do3cc]

* restructured test setup, since call semantics changed [do3cc]

2010-07-16 1.6.0a1
==================

* Fixed deprecated API call to registerType without Package Name. Works now for
  Plone4.
  [2010-01-15, thet]

* Added Products.LinguaPlone as test dependency to extras_require and begun
  fixing tests.
  [2010-01-15, thet]

* removed old slow VDEX implementation; added stub for import/export of vocabs
  with generixsetup; added support for vdex import with genericsetup.
  [2008-07-22, jensens]

2008-06-04 1.4.2
================

* added spanish translations provided by Diego Municio
  (see http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/39)

* merged in Duke's patch for multilingual csv import for simple vocabularies
  (see http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/53)

  [2008-06-02 fRiSi]


* fixed test setup so ATVM is set up using the new GS profile
  added by naro. (tested with plone 3.1.1 buildout)

  this fixes http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/52

  also got rid of tests.framework

  [2008-06-04 fRiSi]


* added imsvdex as a required dependency in setup.py
  which makes it unnecessary to ``easy_install imsvdex``
  for people using buildout.

  [2008-05-29 fRiSi <harald at webmeisterei(dot)com>]


* added GenericSetup profile, removed Install.py

  [2008-05-21 naro <novotny.radim@gmail.com>]


before 1.4
==========

2007-10-30 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>

* workaround for  #46 Upload from Windows/IE creates wrong ID
* made new VdexFileVocabulary as default for upload form

2007-10-15 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>

* add alternative vdex vocabulary, much faster

2007-08-24 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>

* added convinience method to vocabulary library (tool) which returns
  a dictionary with key=vocbaulary id and value=title of vocabulary (language
  aware.

2007-08-22 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>

* added convinience function to make it easier to fetch a value from a
  vocabulary dictionary (utils.vocabs.fetchValueByKeyFromVocabularyDict).

2007-05-24 andrewburkhalter <andrewb at onenw (dot) org>

* adding css handles to various elements of portal_vocabulary user
  interface, so that if desired, one can easily dumb down the user
  interface for less technical clients with css, but not override the template

2007-06-08 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>

* language negotation to make sure the cache is language aware.

2007-03-02 fRiSi <harald  at webmeisterei (dot) com>

* types/simple/vocabulary.py

  applied patch of issue #4 (sorting of simple vocabularies)

* doc/simplevocabulary.txt

  doctest testing the sorting of simplevocabularies
  sorting might not yet work with translated vocabularies.
  i added a section to test this, but did not yet write the tests there.

2006-12-23 rocky <rocky at serverzen (dot) com>

* event.py, configure.zcml, interfaces.py, types/simple/term.py

  * "renamed events" are now fired when the title of any term is updated.

  * "deleted events" are now fired when a term is deleted from a
    vocabulary; this particular feature will only work when running on
    Zope 2.9 or higher (note: this doesn't make ATVM dependent on Zope 2.9)

2006-11-30 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* types/tree/vocabulary.py, types/simple/vocabulary.py
  replaced ``if not instance is None:`` with a try-except.
  if you are on a type that is not linguaplone enabled,
  and using a vocabulary you got an error when creating an
  object of this type because getLanguage raised an AttributeError.


2006-11-15 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* types/tree/term.py
  to fix http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/26
  in the meantime i solved the problem with the "hack solution"
  to take away the IVocabulary interface from the term that is
  extending the vocabulary.

  (see the issue above for more information.)

* Makefile
  added a new target `clean` that removes stale pyc files and ``*~`` backup
  files

2006-10-23 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* namedvocabulary.py
  used to not add the keypath of a term if the search for a
  term uid in uid-catalog returned more than one value.
  proceeding and just taking the first result is better than
  silently ignoring the path for this item.

2006-09-11 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* Extensions/Install.py

  * did a cleaner check for BadRequest Error in case the tool already
    existed at install time (also added basic tests for installing/uninstalling/and
    reinstalling the product.

  * self.portal.portal_properties.navtree_properties.metaTypesNotToList
    is a tuple by default (on a freshly created plonesite)
    ATVM creates a list at installation time and removes the tool from this list at
    uninstallation. If other products get installed between installing
    and uninstalling, they possibly change metaTypesNotToList back to a tuple again.
    changed the installer and uninstaller to operate on and return a tuple here.
    (should fix http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/10)

* tests/testATVocabularyManager.py
  tests for the installation and uninstallation of the product.
  agreed with jens that we could do a zexp of the vocabularies at uninstallation
  in case this was done by accident.
  (http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/22/)


2006-08-31  jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>

* types/simple/term.py

  * removed bug, which stops me from adding new terms.

2006-08-28  fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* types/simple/term.py

  * SimpleVocabularyTerms now return the canoncial's id
    as key. This differs from the current behaviour but is
    essential for translated vocabularies.
  * getTermKeyPath now returns a list containing
    the key of the term, not it's uid. This is consistent
    with the interface.

* types/simple/vocabulary.py, types/tree/vocabulary.py
  getVocabularyDict now uses instance.getLanguage in favour of
  portal_lanuages.getPreferredLanguage (otherwhise passing instance
  would be useless in most cases)

* tests/testSimpleVocabulary.py
  added a test that checks if translations return the same key
  and if dictionaries are translated.

* backports.py

  * Improved the docstrings to be more explicit.

  * getTermKey now states that all translations of a term
    have the same key.

  * getTermValue: now has an optional ``lang`` parameter
    making ``**kwargs`` needless.

2006-08-21  gotcha <gotcha at bubblenet (dot) be>

* add sorted simple vocabulary
* run i18ndude and update fr and nl

2006-08-03  fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* merged branch supporting catalog searches on hierarchical vocabularies to trunk
  (https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/ATVocabularyManager/branches/treevocab-frisi)


2006-07-25  fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>

* merged current trunk into this branch

* utils/vocabs.py
  utility methods for batch creating vocabularies

* types/simple/term.py types/tree/term.py
  marked methods getVocabularyValue and getVocabularyKey as deprecated and used those
  defined in IVocabularyTerm to make terms implement their interface.

* types/tree/vocabulary.py types/simple/vocabulary.py
  improved linguaplone support.
  also added a testcase

* tests/testTreeVocabulary.py
  testing if treevocabulary is linguaplone aware

* doc/search_treevocabulary.txt
  a doctest explaining how ATVM performs searches on hierarchical
  vocabularies, and how to enable them for your content type.

- Added dutch translations, thanks to Atopia
  [jladage]

  this in ATVM.
  [optilude]

- removed workflows from ATVM types on installation
  [ferri]

- added brazilian portuguese translation and portal_vocabularies title i18n
  support

  navigation tree
  [panjunyong]
