Description: ================================================================
        ATVocabularyManager: a vocabulary managing portal tool for Plone
        ================================================================
        
        Overview:
        =========
        
        - ATVocabularyManager offers central through the Plone management of
        dynamic vocabularies.
        
        - This product is based on Archetypes and made to work with Archetypes as well
        as with other Products. It is intended use is within Archetypes Fields.
        Using it as a vocabulary provider for CMFMetadata worked out fine too.
        Integration with different other products will work as well.
        
        - to use a managed vocabulary simply add the term
        ``vocabulary = NamedVocabulary("myvocabulary")`` to the fields of your
        Archetypes Schema, import NamedVocabulary from this Product and create
        your vocabulary with id myvocabulary in 'portal_vocabularies' tool
        (available through Plone Site-Setup).
        
        - ATVocabularyManager supports:
        
        simple flat key
        value vocabularies,
        
        tree like
        hierachical vocabularies (see Limitations),
        
        IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange Format (VDEX) aware vocabularies
        with XML Import and Export. VDEX is i18n-aware by its nature and does
        not need LinguaPlone!
        
        Vocabularies are pluggable types.
        ATVocabularyManager is prepared for extension with your special
        vocabulary type. ArchGenXML will help you here.
        Each vocabulary term needs to be an CMF aware content type. Reuse normal
        rich content as a vocabularies.
        
        ArchGenXML 1.4+ code-generator does full integration of ATVocabularyManager:
        via tagged value defined named vocabularies are registered transparently,
        VDEX-XML files are imported at install-time, stub vocabularies are created
        at install time and custom types are registered by just providing appropriate
        stereotypes.
        
        ATVM is Linguaplone compatible (only tested with SimpleVocabulary, and
        TreeVocabulary). Add a simple vocabulary with some items, install and configure
        Linguaplone, translate the vocabulary to the language(s) of your choice,
        translate every item to the language(s) of your choice. NamedVocabulary() will
        return the vocabulary as usual, the keys will stay the same disregarding
        language settings, the values will show in the currently selected language.
        VDEX vocabularies are not using LinguaPlone, but are i18n-aware (imo much
        better than  everything else).
        
        You can do hierachy-aware searches on treevocabularies (for more information on
        this see doc/search_treevocabulary.txt) attention: curently certain changes in
        the term hierachy require a catalog rebuild (see Limitations).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Put the egg in your buildout or include it manual. In Plone go to portal_setup
        and
        
        To speed up ATVocabularyManager you might want to associate it with a
        Cache-Manager.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        - Archetypes 1.5.x
        
        - Targets with Plone 3.1+
        
        - imsvdex (usally it get fetched automatically as dependency, otherwise
        easy_install imsvdex - )
        
        - Linguaplone (optional: for tests and multilingual vocabularies)
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        If you're using a buildout run the tests using
        
        bin/instance test -s Products.ATVocabularyManager
        
        To run a certain testmodule run
        
        bin/instance test -s Products.ATVocabularyManager -m testSimpleVocabulary
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        - UI work
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        TreeVocabulary catalog updates
        If you are using the hierachy-aware catalog search support of
        tree-vocabularies you need to rebuild the uid_catalog and portal_catalog
        if you move a vocabularyterm that has other terms below it.
        
        Creation/Edit of VDEX TTW is difficult.
        Take an editor of your choice, create the vocab and upload it or help
        writing an UI.
        
        
        Known Bugs
        ==========
        
        - UI does not show in all cases vocabulary/items properly.
        
        Feel free to add bugs in here!

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        ========================================
        History for Products.ATVocabularyManager
        ========================================
        
        2011-02-22 1.6
        ==============
        
        * dont fetch version and shortdesc from metadata.xml - this is wrong. [jensens]
        
        2011-02-18 1.6.0a2
        ==================
        
        * changed method of dermining if LinguaPlone is installed. Asking QI does not
        work in Plone4 [naro]
        
        * added some missing dependencies, and a new extra section to setup.py.
        This helps to get a simple buildout cfg for testing against plone4 [do3cc]
        
        * added some sleeps between installs in the tests, else genericsetup
        creates ids twice, and fails [do3cc]
        
        * temporary deactivated two checks in the tests. With
        Products.CMFQuickInstaller>=3.0.3, the portal_vocabularies don't get
        deleted during uninstall [do3cc]
        
        * restructured test setup, since call semantics changed [do3cc]
        
        2010-07-16 1.6.0a1
        ==================
        
        * Fixed deprecated API call to registerType without Package Name. Works now for
        Plone4.
        [2010-01-15, thet]
        
        * Added Products.LinguaPlone as test dependency to extras_require and begun
        fixing tests.
        [2010-01-15, thet]
        
        * removed old slow VDEX implementation; added stub for import/export of vocabs
        with generixsetup; added support for vdex import with genericsetup.
        [2008-07-22, jensens]
        
        2008-06-04 1.4.2
        ================
        
        * added spanish translations provided by Diego Municio
        (see http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/39)
        
        * merged in Duke's patch for multilingual csv import for simple vocabularies
        (see http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/53)
        
        [2008-06-02 fRiSi]
        
        
        * fixed test setup so ATVM is set up using the new GS profile
        added by naro. (tested with plone 3.1.1 buildout)
        
        this fixes http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/52
        
        also got rid of tests.framework
        
        [2008-06-04 fRiSi]
        
        
        * added imsvdex as a required dependency in setup.py
        which makes it unnecessary to ``easy_install imsvdex``
        for people using buildout.
        
        [2008-05-29 fRiSi <harald at webmeisterei(dot)com>]
        
        
        * added GenericSetup profile, removed Install.py
        
        [2008-05-21 naro <novotny.radim@gmail.com>]
        
        
        before 1.4
        ==========
        
        2007-10-30 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>
        
        * workaround for  #46 Upload from Windows/IE creates wrong ID
        * made new VdexFileVocabulary as default for upload form
        
        2007-10-15 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>
        
        * add alternative vdex vocabulary, much faster
        
        2007-08-24 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>
        
        * added convinience method to vocabulary library (tool) which returns
        a dictionary with key=vocbaulary id and value=title of vocabulary (language
        aware.
        
        2007-08-22 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>
        
        * added convinience function to make it easier to fetch a value from a
        vocabulary dictionary (utils.vocabs.fetchValueByKeyFromVocabularyDict).
        
        2007-05-24 andrewburkhalter <andrewb at onenw (dot) org>
        
        * adding css handles to various elements of portal_vocabulary user
        interface, so that if desired, one can easily dumb down the user
        interface for less technical clients with css, but not override the template
        
        2007-06-08 jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>
        
        * language negotation to make sure the cache is language aware.
        
        2007-03-02 fRiSi <harald  at webmeisterei (dot) com>
        
        * types/simple/vocabulary.py
        
        applied patch of issue #4 (sorting of simple vocabularies)
        
        * doc/simplevocabulary.txt
        
        doctest testing the sorting of simplevocabularies
        sorting might not yet work with translated vocabularies.
        i added a section to test this, but did not yet write the tests there.
        
        2006-12-23 rocky <rocky at serverzen (dot) com>
        
        * event.py, configure.zcml, interfaces.py, types/simple/term.py
        
        * "renamed events" are now fired when the title of any term is updated.
        
        * "deleted events" are now fired when a term is deleted from a
        vocabulary; this particular feature will only work when running on
        Zope 2.9 or higher (note: this doesn't make ATVM dependent on Zope 2.9)
        
        2006-11-30 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * types/tree/vocabulary.py, types/simple/vocabulary.py
        replaced ``if not instance is None:`` with a try-except.
        if you are on a type that is not linguaplone enabled,
        and using a vocabulary you got an error when creating an
        object of this type because getLanguage raised an AttributeError.
        
        
        2006-11-15 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * types/tree/term.py
        to fix http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/26
        in the meantime i solved the problem with the "hack solution"
        to take away the IVocabulary interface from the term that is
        extending the vocabulary.
        
        (see the issue above for more information.)
        
        * Makefile
        added a new target `clean` that removes stale pyc files and ``*~`` backup
        files
        
        2006-10-23 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * namedvocabulary.py
        used to not add the keypath of a term if the search for a
        term uid in uid-catalog returned more than one value.
        proceeding and just taking the first result is better than
        silently ignoring the path for this item.
        
        2006-09-11 fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * Extensions/Install.py
        
        * did a cleaner check for BadRequest Error in case the tool already
        existed at install time (also added basic tests for installing/uninstalling/and
        reinstalling the product.
        
        * self.portal.portal_properties.navtree_properties.metaTypesNotToList
        is a tuple by default (on a freshly created plonesite)
        ATVM creates a list at installation time and removes the tool from this list at
        uninstallation. If other products get installed between installing
        and uninstalling, they possibly change metaTypesNotToList back to a tuple again.
        changed the installer and uninstaller to operate on and return a tuple here.
        (should fix http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/10)
        
        * tests/testATVocabularyManager.py
        tests for the installation and uninstallation of the product.
        agreed with jens that we could do a zexp of the vocabularies at uninstallation
        in case this was done by accident.
        (http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager/issues/22/)
        
        
        2006-08-31  jensens <jens at bluedynamics (dot) com>
        
        * types/simple/term.py
        
        * removed bug, which stops me from adding new terms.
        
        2006-08-28  fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * types/simple/term.py
        
        * SimpleVocabularyTerms now return the canoncial's id
        as key. This differs from the current behaviour but is
        essential for translated vocabularies.
        * getTermKeyPath now returns a list containing
        the key of the term, not it's uid. This is consistent
        with the interface.
        
        * types/simple/vocabulary.py, types/tree/vocabulary.py
        getVocabularyDict now uses instance.getLanguage in favour of
        portal_lanuages.getPreferredLanguage (otherwhise passing instance
        would be useless in most cases)
        
        * tests/testSimpleVocabulary.py
        added a test that checks if translations return the same key
        and if dictionaries are translated.
        
        * backports.py
        
        * Improved the docstrings to be more explicit.
        
        * getTermKey now states that all translations of a term
        have the same key.
        
        * getTermValue: now has an optional ``lang`` parameter
        making ``**kwargs`` needless.
        
        2006-08-21  gotcha <gotcha at bubblenet (dot) be>
        
        * add sorted simple vocabulary
        * run i18ndude and update fr and nl
        
        2006-08-03  fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * merged branch supporting catalog searches on hierarchical vocabularies to trunk
        (https://svn.plone.org/svn/archetypes/ATVocabularyManager/branches/treevocab-frisi)
        
        
        2006-07-25  fRiSi <harald (dot) friessnegger at lovelysystems (dot) com>
        
        * merged current trunk into this branch
        
        * utils/vocabs.py
        utility methods for batch creating vocabularies
        
        * types/simple/term.py types/tree/term.py
        marked methods getVocabularyValue and getVocabularyKey as deprecated and used those
        defined in IVocabularyTerm to make terms implement their interface.
        
        * types/tree/vocabulary.py types/simple/vocabulary.py
        improved linguaplone support.
        also added a testcase
        
        * tests/testTreeVocabulary.py
        testing if treevocabulary is linguaplone aware
        
        * doc/search_treevocabulary.txt
        a doctest explaining how ATVM performs searches on hierarchical
        vocabularies, and how to enable them for your content type.
        
        - Added dutch translations, thanks to Atopia
        [jladage]
        
        - AllowedTypesByIface is broken, it seems - adding manual override to fix
        this in ATVM.
        [optilude]
        
        - removed workflows from ATVM types on installation
        [ferri]
        
        - added brazilian portuguese translation and portal_vocabularies title i18n
        support
        [ferri]
        
        - added i18n and Czech translation
        [naro]
        
        - uncommented code in Install.py to make portal_vocabularylib not show in the
        navigation tree
        [panjunyong]
        
        - use StringWidget instead of IDWidget for Simple vocaublary term
