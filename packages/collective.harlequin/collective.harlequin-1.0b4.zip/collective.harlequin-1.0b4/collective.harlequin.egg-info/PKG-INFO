Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Harlequin provide infrastructure to make configurable browser view without
        to have to deals with how the configuration data are stored. Most of the time
        developers faced to this issue store data in the model. This is bad because
        all instances have those data and do not necessary need it.
        
        Your configuration view data are stored and your view can access to this
        configuration easily.
        
        This module doesn't provide any 'user' feature to Plone.
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        You can checkout the example package inside.
