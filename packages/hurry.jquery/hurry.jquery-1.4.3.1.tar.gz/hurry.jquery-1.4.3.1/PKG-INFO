        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages jQuery_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware of jQuery's
        structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        .. _jQuery: http://jquery.com/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery from ``hurry.jquery`` and ``.need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          from hurry.jquery import jquery
        
          .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
          jquery.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``hurry.resource``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``jquery-build``
        directory in ``hurry.jquery``) are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you depend
        on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above example
        should work out of the box. Make sure to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_
        package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.jquery before release
        =====================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.jquery``.
        
        The javascript code that this package relies on is not checked into
        subversion to sidestep the copyright policy of svn.zope.org. Instead,
        just before release to pypi, an entry point is triggered that
        downloads the appropriate javascript code. To trigger this automated
        behavior you should do the release using ``bin/fullrelease``, which
        uses zest.releaser configured with the appropriate entry points.
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        1.4.3.1 (2010-10-18)
        ====================
        
        * Using jQuery-1.4.3.
        
        1.4.2.3 (2010-07-28)
        ====================
        
        * We needed to do some safety checks in the zest.releaser entry points
          as otherwise these entry points would be triggered even for the
          release process of packages that depend on this (such as
          hurry.jqueryui).
        
        1.4.2.2 (2010-07-28)
        ====================
        
        * Relying on new hurry.resource 0.10, which needs an entry point.
        
        * Export ``jquery_lib`` as the library. Before this change library was
          not accessible as it was immediately overwritten by the ``jquery``
          ResourceInclusion. This means that jquery resources will now be
          published under ``jquery_lib`` in the URL instead of ``jquery``, but
          since these URLs are automatically generated this should be okay.
        
        1.4.2.1 (2010-03-14)
        ====================
        
        * Using jQuery-1.4.2.
        
        * Added zest.releaser and using its prerelease-entrypoint to assure download
          of the jquery libary before release.  No functional changes.
        
        
        1.3.2.1 (2009-05-27)
        ====================
