        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages jQuery_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware of jQuery's
        structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        .. _jQuery: http://jquery.com/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery from ``hurry.jquery`` and ``.need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          from hurry.jquery import jquery
        
          .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
          jquery.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``hurry.resource``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``jquery-build``
        directory in ``hurry.jquery``) are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you depend
        on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above example
        should work out of the box. Make sure to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_
        package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.jquery before release
        =====================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.jquery``.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.jquery``, an extra step should be taken. Follow the
        regular package `release instructions`_, but before egg generation (``python
        setup.py register sdist upload``) first execute ``bin/jqueryprepare``. This
        will download the jQuery library and place it in the egg.  (The version number
        is currently hardcoded in the hurry.jquery.prepare module).

        CHANGES
        *******
        
        1.4.2.2 (2010-07-28)
        ====================
        
        * Relying on new hurry.resource 0.10, which needs an entry point.
        
        * Export ``jquery_lib`` as the library. Before this change library was
          not accessible as it was immediately overwritten by the ``jquery``
          ResourceInclusion. This means that jquery resources will now be
          published under ``jquery_lib`` in the URL instead of ``jquery``, but
          since these URLs are automatically generated this should be okay.
        
        1.4.2.1 (2010-03-14)
        ====================
        
        * Using jQuery-1.4.2.
        
        * Added zest.releaser and using its prerelease-entrypoint to assure download
          of the jquery libary before release.  No functional changes.
