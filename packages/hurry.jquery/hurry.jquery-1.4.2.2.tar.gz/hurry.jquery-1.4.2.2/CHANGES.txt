1.4.2.2 (2010-07-28)
====================

* Relying on new hurry.resource 0.10, which needs an entry point.

* Export ``jquery_lib`` as the library. Before this change library was
  not accessible as it was immediately overwritten by the ``jquery``
  ResourceInclusion. This means that jquery resources will now be
  published under ``jquery_lib`` in the URL instead of ``jquery``, but
  since these URLs are automatically generated this should be okay.

1.4.2.1 (2010-03-14)
====================

* Using jQuery-1.4.2.

* Added zest.releaser and using its prerelease-entrypoint to assure download
  of the jquery libary before release.  No functional changes.


1.3.2.1 (2009-05-27)
====================

* Initial public release, using jQuery-1.3.2.
