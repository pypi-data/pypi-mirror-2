Description: Products.BrFieldsAndWidgets
        ===========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Products.BrFieldsAndWidgets is a product that aims to help Brazilian developers
        to deploy AT based content types on a Plone 3 site.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Plone 3.1.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``Products.BrFieldsAndWidgets``
        to the list of eggs to install ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        Products.BrFieldsAndWidgets
        
        
        If another package depends on the Products.BrFieldsAndWidgets egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
        in order to see the effects of the product installation.
