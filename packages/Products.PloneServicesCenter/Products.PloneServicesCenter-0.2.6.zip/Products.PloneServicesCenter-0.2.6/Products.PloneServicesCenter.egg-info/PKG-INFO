        Historical
        ----------
        
        Code was originally designed and implemented for the successful, but now defunct plone.net.
        Plone.net was folded back in to plone.org at the Cioppino Sprint in early 2011::
        
            This software is designed for the future plone.net. As such, while
            others are welcome to them, they are not neccessarily intended for
            public consumption.  We welcome bug fixes, but please refrain from
            adding new features without talking with the developers first.

            Vision
            ------
        
            plone.org currently mixes community and commercial announcements.
            During the last year the policy has gotten strict about not doing
            commercial postings.  However, we need a place for providing business
            information to decision-makers.
        
            This is the vision for plone.net: "All the business information,
            attractive and organized, for decision-makers."  We want to collect
            case studies, solution providers, mentions in the press, training
            announcements, books and articles, etc.  And, we want to present this
            information in a well-organized fashion.  Finally, we want a strong
            editorial process to ensure we don't have 500 companies claiming to be
            the galaxy's leading Plone company. :^)
        
            Additionally, we want the Plone Foundation to have a revenue stream.
            For example, we need to start exhibiting at conferences, to make sure
            we win "Best of Show", to make sure we're always considered the
            leaders.  We plan to do the solution provider directory in a way where
            companies that sponsor the foundation get a better listing, just like
            the Pages Jaunes.
