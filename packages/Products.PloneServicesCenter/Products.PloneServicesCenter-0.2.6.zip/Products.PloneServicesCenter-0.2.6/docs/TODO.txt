I18n and L10n TODO

  * i18n and l10n the bellow vocabulary: getCompanySizes (Provider.py)

  * i18n and l10n the bellow vocabulary: industryVocabulary (Install.py)

  - i18n and l10n the Firm size in Provider form

  - i18n and l10n the bellow validations messages: isURL, isEmail (Products.validation/validators/BaseValidators.py)

  - Support GenericSetup

  - A GenericSetup profile for setup the demo remplace the CREATE_INITIAL_CONTENT = True from configpy file

  - The Country List shows the countries in English and no support l10n in 

  - The Industry List shows the countries in English and no support l10n in (siteusingplone_view.pt)


M1

  - Move this list to Trac [wink]

  - Have a view for the Plone Services Folder driven by a ZPT in the
    skin.

  - Set Industries and Countries from a config file instead of TTW

  - Members need permissions to add content in Plone Services Folder
    (didn't work out-of-the-box)

  - Have a portlet during the M1/M2 cycle that points to Trac


High

  - Folder views.  How does sites_listing work?  What is the sort
    expression?

  - Basic single-item views.  Need some more attractive views for
    Provider etc.

  - Filters.  These are the little boxes Joel currently has on the
    authoring side.

  - Deployment.  We need the content creation side turned on soon.
    This means directory.plone.org running on the plone.org box.  This
    is already done by Joel, we just need to "admins" to re-enable it.

  - Support internationalization (i18n) at all vocabularies, like Industries, 
    and Size of the company.

  - Support localization (l10n) for the render of the vocabulary Countries, 
    because in the render view still shows the tems in English.


Medium

  - Reports.  If Paul can get some queries that return the right
    nested results, then Paul can make progress on the public-facing
    reports.  First report: by country and by industry, sorted by
    rating.

  - "chown".  If Paul enters a resource and later, the company
    responsible for that wants to make changes, Paul needs a simple
    way to assign this resource.  (Perhaps just normal Plone
    machinery?)

  - Content type for Training announcement.  (Or, some kind of
    marker.)

  - Bulk loading.  Geir wrote an import script for the PloneCon talk
    schedule, so that Paul didn't need to re-type so much stuff. We
    could adapt that or try and use Marshall.


Low

  - Content type (or marker) for Plone User Groups.

  - Good interlinking.  Whenever a provider is shown on a case study
    or such, there should be a link to the entry for the provider.
    The entry for the provider should show links to all the other
    entries that point to it.

  - New skin for plone.net.  We need a professional-looking
    look-and-feel for plone.net that doesn't look like plone.org.  We
    can do this after we start collecting data.

  - Out-of-the-box industries/countries.  It would be nice if
    Install.py created some default countries etc.
