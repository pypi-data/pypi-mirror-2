        Installation and configuration
        ``````````````````````````````
        
        On the web/data server host
        ---------------------------
        
        * Install cubicweb and the cubicweb-apycot packages (more info in the
          `cubicweb book`_). Notice that the apycot cube may be integrated with
          `tracker`_ based instances.
        
        * Create TestConfig / TestConfigGroup entities through the web ui of
          your instance(s) to describe what to test. (See `More documentation`_)
        
        * Modify password for the apycotbot user for better security
        
        
        On the bot host
        ---------------
        
        * Install apycotbot package.
        
        * edit /etc/apycotbot.ini, or ~/etc/etc/apycotbot.ini when running
          code from hg, to adjust the bot configuration. You can also generate
          a stub configuration file using `apycotbot --generate-rcfile
          /etc/apycotbot.ini`
        
        * If using different user/password for the apycot bot in cubicweb
          instances than default ones (higly recommanded), indicates connection
          information for each instance in a /etc/apycotbot-cw-sources.ini file.
          for instance ::
        
              [cwo]
              user=apycotbot
              password=apycot
        
              [elo]
              user=apycotbot
              password=apycot
        
          where each section is the pyro name of an instance. You should
          restrict read perms to this file agressivly.
        
        * for those running from source, apycotbot/bin/apycotclient should be
          in PATH
        
        .. _`cubicweb book`: http://www.cubicweb.org/
        .. _`tracker`: http://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-tracker
        
        Once both side are running, check both are properly registered in the
        pyro name server by running
        
          pyro-nsc listall
        
        You should see your instance as 'cubicweb:...' and the bot as 'narval:...'.
         or in /etc (narval from debian package). This
        allows arbitrary password (it's recommended to change the default one), and
        also have the nice effect that when your bot will be (re)started, it will connect
        to each instance listed in this file to search for pending plans.
