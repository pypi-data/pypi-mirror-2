1.5.0 2010/12/1
---------------


  - Create configuration options for subscription portlet, keywords portlet,
    root site subscription, document action display.

  - Adding a subscription, then changing a document and sending subscriptions
    didn't work. Unfortunately, this is exactly what people will do when testing
    PloneSubscription the first time:(. It was validated that the last 
    subscription time minus the current time is bigger than the periodicity. 
    This makes sense after the first sending, but not at the moment of the first 
    sending.

  - Remove on transition filter in subscription portlet

  - Add afterQueryFilters on subscriber_view results preview

  - Change subscriber_view columns order: results preview move to last

  - Fix loosing subscriptions with all virtualhosting solution

  - i18n refactoring

  - Manage Subscriptions Permission added to control access to the management 
    template accessible from the portlet_subscription.pt

  - Fix getGroupSubscriberVocabulary

  - Folder Subscriptions done from the subscription_portlet now subscribe
    to the publish transition of content recursively

  - Adding last modified column to my subscriptions list

  - Anonymous needs view content permission, not edit

  - Fix problem with unsubscribing from FolderSubscriptions
 
  - Added portlet for subscription by anonymous or member

  - Add workflow transitions field to FolderSubscription, which makes it
    possible to notify only for the specified transitions

  - Store references to root in portal_subscription. As the Plone Site is not
    an Archetype, there is no other solution for now.
