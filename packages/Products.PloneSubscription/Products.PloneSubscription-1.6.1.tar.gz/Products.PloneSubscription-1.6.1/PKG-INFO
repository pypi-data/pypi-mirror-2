        ============================
        
        Important
        =========
        
        This version is intended to the sites that ran under Plone 2.x with a former
        version of this component and that migrated to Plone 3.x
        
        New sites built with Plone 3.x or later should consider using **iw.subscriber**
        instead.
        
        To install subscription portlets use the classical portlet in plone3 portlets dashboard.
        
        template = portlet_subscription (and/or portlet_keywords_subscription)
        macro = portlet
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * Plone 3.0.x
        * DataGridField 1.0
        * PloneMaintenance 1.1
        
        - Make sure to install PloneMaintenance before PloneSubscription

        Overview
        ========
        
          PloneSubscription: A Plone tool for managing subscriptions
        
          The tool allows members and administrators to manage user and group subscription
          for content as well as for keyword searches. Content subscription can be done
          recursively and with the possibility to filter for documents that were recently
          subject to a workflow transition.
        
          There is a special tool for managing mail templates for subscription mails
          sent by PloneSubscription. The template system is fairly simple for the moment,
          but we are looking for improvement proposals to make it more powerful.
        
          Further PloneSubscription information can be found at http://ingeniweb.sourceforge.net/Products/PloneSubscription
        
        Usage
        =====
        
          Plone members will find a new icon document action (on the right side under
          the title), which allows them to quickly subscribe to content. Subscription
          is done with a single click, and doesn't disturb the member any further.
        
          Users can check their subscriptions by clicking on "my subscriptions" link,
          available in the user action box. The link to "my subscriptions" is only
          shown when a user is already subscribed to something.
        
          Another way of subscribing to content is after doing a search in Plone. In
          a special portlet, the member can choose to subscribe to the search he just
          made. This feature is only available for a simple Plone search, and will
          ignore any advanced search options that may have been chosen.
        
          Subscriptions can also be managed on a per group basis, but as this is an
          advanced feature it is only available for members who explicitly get the
          "PlacelessSubscription: Manage Content" permission.
        
          With this permission, an administrative user can add group subscriptions
          in just three clicks. First click on the "grouped subscription" tab on the
          current content, select the groups to subscribe, and click on save, and you
          are done.
        
          The permission also allows access to the PloneSubscription tool in the
          Plone Control Panel.
        
          Some noteworthy options of the PloneSubscription tool are:
        
            The 'show actions' option, which adds extra tabs on folderish objects
            for quickly adding subsciption and mail template providers locally.
            This is mostly interesting while doing through the web development.
        
            The 'periodicity' defines after which period of time the subscriptions are sent.
            You can send hourly, daily, weekly and yearly subscriptions.
        
            The 'Base url' field is used to replace a url like 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/plone' by
            'http://mydomain.com/' in the link provided in the sent mails.
        
          Mail sent is managed with templates stored in a specific repository. It's easy
          to add new variables to the template namespace. The next release of PloneSubscription
          will focus on a refactoring of these templates so that they are more subscription
          centric instead of type centric.
        
        Advanced Usage
        
          Your users should not need access the subscription objects themselves, so
          the "PlacelessSubscription: Manage Content" permission is not given to Members
          any more.
        
          The best practice is to make sure the subscriptions are already added the
          right way by passing in the correct parameters as it is done in the portlet:
        
            '/addSubscription?ptype='+ptype + '&amp;recursive=1&amp;workflow=1&amp;transitions:list=publish&amp;transitions:list=visible'
        
          In this case you need to set the ptype to the subscription type you want and
          specify the parameters in advance.
        
        Tracing email
        
          Add to your zope.conf ::
        
           <product-config plonesubscription> 
           trace_send_mail True
           </product-config>
        
        Changes log
        ===========
        
        1.6.1 (2011-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Add three new button in admin interface for easiest management
        
        
        1.6.0 (2011-06-29)
        ------------------
        
          - add a new option for tracing email sending 
            add to zope.conf ::
            
             <product-config plonesubscription> 
             trace_send_mail True
             </product-config>  
            
            and mail send is trace on event.log
        
        1.5.0 2010/12/1
        ---------------
        
        
          - Create configuration options for subscription portlet, keywords portlet,
            root site subscription, document action display.
        
          - Adding a subscription, then changing a document and sending subscriptions
            didn't work. Unfortunately, this is exactly what people will do when testing
            PloneSubscription the first time:(. It was validated that the last 
            subscription time minus the current time is bigger than the periodicity. 
            This makes sense after the first sending, but not at the moment of the first 
            sending.
        
          - Remove on transition filter in subscription portlet
        
          - Add afterQueryFilters on subscriber_view results preview
        
          - Change subscriber_view columns order: results preview move to last
        
          - Fix loosing subscriptions with all virtualhosting solution
        
          - i18n refactoring
        
          - Manage Subscriptions Permission added to control access to the management 
            template accessible from the portlet_subscription.pt
        
          - Fix getGroupSubscriberVocabulary
        
          - Folder Subscriptions done from the subscription_portlet now subscribe
            to the publish transition of content recursively
        
          - Adding last modified column to my subscriptions list
        
          - Anonymous needs view content permission, not edit
        
          - Fix problem with unsubscribing from FolderSubscriptions
         
          - Added portlet for subscription by anonymous or member
        
          - Add workflow transitions field to FolderSubscription, which makes it
            possible to notify only for the specified transitions
        
          - Store references to root in portal_subscription. As the Plone Site is not
            an Archetype, there is no other solution for now.
