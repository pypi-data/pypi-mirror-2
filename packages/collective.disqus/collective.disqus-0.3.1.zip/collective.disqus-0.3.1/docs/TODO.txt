Tasks for next releases:

  * tests (is there anything that should be tested?)
    (indeed; i.e, we need to test install, uninstall and control panel.
    right now control panel is not being uninstalled [hvelarde])
  * better documentation
  * hide count of comments in Quills' weblog_view
  * override Quills' manage_comments view
  * better promotion (IRC, mailing list, plone.org/products)
