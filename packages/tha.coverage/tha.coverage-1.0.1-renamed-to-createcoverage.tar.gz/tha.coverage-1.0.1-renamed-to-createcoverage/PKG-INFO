Description: tha.coverage: renamed to createzopecoverage
        ===========================================
        
        **Warning**: tha.coverage has been renamed (upon request) to
        `createzopecoverage <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/createzopecoverage>`_.
        You'll only have to change your requirement from tha.coverage to
        createzopecoverage.  (And the script is now called
        ``bin/createzopecoverage``).  Functionally, it is unchanged.
        
        For the last tha.coverage release, see
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tha.coverage/1.0
