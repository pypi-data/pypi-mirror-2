tha.coverage: renamed to createzopecoverage
===========================================

**Warning**: tha.coverage has been renamed (upon request) to
`createzopecoverage <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/createzopecoverage>`_.
You'll only have to change your requirement from tha.coverage to
createzopecoverage.  (And the script is now called
``bin/createzopecoverage``).  Functionally, it is unchanged.

For the last tha.coverage release, see
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tha.coverage/1.0
