Description: no_comments
        ===========
        
        Easy way to strip comments from various file types.
        
        Description:
        ------------
        
        Comment stripping utility. Handles both inline comments and block comments.
        Strips C/C++ comments by default (both inline and block).
        
        Usage:
        ------
        - `cat source_code_file | no_comments > out`
        
        Features:
        ---------
        - strip only inline comments / block comments
        - configurable delimiters
        - strip only comments at the beggining of the line
        - preserve empty lines which contained comments before
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        - `easy_install no_comments` or  `pip install no_comments`
        - run `no_comments --help`
        
        
        Notes:
        -------
        This utility is DUMB - as it's not language specific it doesn't understand the syntax (It
        will remove comments in strings, ignore nested comments or so).
