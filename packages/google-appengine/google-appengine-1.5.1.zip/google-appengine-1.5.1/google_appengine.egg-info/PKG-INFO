Description: 
        About
        -----
        
        NB. This is a copy of the official AppEngine SDK and not guaranteed to be up to date
        with the latest official version.
        
        This package is an "easy_install-able" version of the Python Appengine SDK files
        created to make the SDK amenable to installation within a virtual environment. This
        is solely for the purpose of running tests in development - to run your app itself,
        you still need to run it via your copy of the actual SDK from outside the virtualenv.
        However, with the appropriate use of symlinks this can be transparent and you can
        develop your appengine app within the virtualenv as you would any other python app.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        First create and activate a virtualenv, then from within the env::
        
        pip install googleappengine
