Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Stargate is a package for adding WebSockets_ support to
        pyramid applications using the excellent eventlet library for long running
        connections
        
        What is a WebSocket?
        ====================
        
        From wikipedia::
        
            WebSockets is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex
            communications channels, over a single TCP socket
        
        The WebSocket protocol provides a persistent low latency, low complexity way to
        achieve two way communication from the browser to server.
        
        From a client point of view using websocket is very simple::
        
            var ws = new WebSocket('ws://somehost/some/url');
            ws.onopen = function(msg){
                //do some cool setup
            }
            ws.onmessage = function(msg){
                //do something cool
            }
            ws.onclose = function(msg){
                //do some clean up... stay cool
            }
        
            // later:
            ws.send('How cool am I?!');
        
        That's pretty much all there is to it.
        
        Normally the websocket communication in a web app is implemented as a stand alone
        server (perhaps running on a different port). rpz.websocket allows you to connect
        persistent connection directly to the same objects that serve your HTML.
