        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product add a new criteria for dates inside Plone, someway similar to the "*Relative date*" ones,
        but beeing able to perform some impossible search if using standard date criteria.
        
        What you can't do with the default Plone relative criteria is configure a Collection that:
        
        * show all events that begin today
        * show all news published this month
        * show all file modified this year
        * ... and so on.
        
        The today, this month and this year values change automatically.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        The new criteria displays a simple selection between:
        
        * Today
        * This year
        * This month

        :alt: Period of time criteria
        
        Where those values are relative to the current date.
        
        Going back to first example of the previous section: at 12:55 PM of January 21 I will see an event that
        starts at 8 AM of January 21.
        As soon as I visit the Collection again at midnight of January 22 I will no see the event again, but
        automatically begin to see all events that starts January 22
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Tested with *Plone 3.3*.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * More tests (the few there are GMT+1 specific)
        * Right now the calculation of dates is crappy. Think about replace the ``DateTime`` use with
        standard ``datetime`` module.
        Are Collection still working with ``datetime``?
        * Adding Plone 4 compatibility
        * Translations issues (I fear will be worst when using on Plone 4)
