js.json_template
****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `JSON Template`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`JSON Template`: https://code.google.com/p/json-template

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.json_template``) are published to some URL.
