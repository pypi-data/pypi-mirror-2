        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        slc.seminarportal can be used to model and present seminars and
        conferences.
        
        When you view a seminar, you will be presented with a roster showing all
        the rooms (venues) and the speeches held in those rooms. The roster is a
        table with the rooms as the columns and the times of the speeches as the
        rows.
        
        To show a column with the speech times on the roster, make sure to check the
        box on the bottom of the seminar edit page.
        
        Content Types:
        --------------
        
        The following content types are available:
        
        * Seminar
        The Seminar is globally addable and contains all the seminar-related
        subobjets.
        
        
        * Speakers Folder
        The Speakers folder is automatically created whenever a seminar has been
        created. This folder's allowed content types are restricted to speakers
        only.
        
        
        * Speaker
        Every conference and seminar has people holding talks, making presentations
        and giving speeches. These people are modeled with the speaker content type.
        You can add references to speeches (i.e the speeches held by this speaker).
        These references are two-way, so the speeches now also have references to this
        speaker.
        
        
        * Speech Venues Folder
        The Speech Venues folder is also automatically created when a seminar is
        created. This folder's allowed content types are restricted to speech venues
        only.
        
        
        * Speech Venue
        A speech venue refers to the room or conference hall in which speeches are held.
        This folder's allowed content types are restricted to speeches only.
        
        
        * Speech
        A speech is a talk or presentation held at the conference and in one of the
        rooms/venues. You can add references to speakers (i.e the speakers who held
        the speech). These references are two-way, so the speakers now also have
        references to the speeches.
        
        Other features:
        You can add a 'layout' property on the folder containing your seminars.
        Give the value of '@@seminarfolder-view' and you will have now a special
        view for your seminars with simple and advanced search options.
        
        Dummy Data:
        -----------
        
        If you want to get an impression of the structure, views and content types provided by
        slc.seminarportal, then you can create some dummy seminars, speakers and
        speeches with a provided external method.
        
        In the Zope management interface, create a new external method by choosing it
        from the dropdown box.
        
        Then give the following values:
        - id: create_seminar_test_data (or whatever you prefer)
        - Title: (whatever you prefer)
        - Module Name: slc.seminarportal.create_seminar_test_data
        - Function Name: run
        
        After saving, click on the 'test' tab and wait for the external method to
        finish executing.
        
        You should now have a 'Seminars' folder with dummy data in your Plone root.
