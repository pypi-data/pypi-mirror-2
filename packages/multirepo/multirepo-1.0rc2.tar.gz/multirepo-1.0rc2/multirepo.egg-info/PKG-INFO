        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ extension to affect multiple
        repositories simultaneously. All commands that affect other repositories 
        (**push**, **paths**, **out** and **bundle**) are wrapped.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        If you have installed ``multirepo.py`` in your ``PYTHONPATH``, activate the
        extension in ``.hgrc``::
        
        	[extensions]
        	hgext.multirepo=
        	
        Otherwise, you will need to specify the full path to the extension::
        
        	[extensions]
        	multirepo = path/to/multirepo.py
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add paths to target to ``.hgrc`` in the ``multirepo`` section; attributes
        starting with **path.** are interpreted as targets for multirepo::
        
        	[multirepo]
        	path.abc = /path/to/a/repo
        	path.another = /path/to/another/repo
        
        The **default** path (or **default-push** if it is defined) is included in the
        list of paths to this extension will target unless you set **include.default**
        to *False*::
        
        	[multirepo]
        	include.default = False
        	path.abc = /path/to/a/repo
        	path.another = /path/to/another/repo
        
        All wrapped commands affect all targets unless a specific target is given on the
        command-line.

        --------
        
        :about:
        
        	I first wrote multirepo so that I could push to a backup repo and a
        	public repo in a single operation. Then, I started using the extension at
        	work to manage a series of repos used by the team.
