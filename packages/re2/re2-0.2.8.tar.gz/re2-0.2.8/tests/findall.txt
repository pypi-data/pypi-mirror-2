findall tests
=============

    >>> import re2

This one is from http://docs.python.org/library/re.html?#finding-all-adverbs:

    >>> re2.findall(r"\w+ly", "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police.")
    ['carefully', 'quickly']

This one makes sure all groups are found:

    >>> re2.findall("(\w+)=(\d+)", "foo=1,foo=2")
    [('foo', '1'), ('foo', '2')]

When there's only one matched group, it should not be returned in a tuple:

    >>> re2.findall("(\w)", "f")
    ['f']

Zero matches is an empty list:

    >>> re2.findall("(f)", "gggg")
    []
