Description: 
        Like Twisted, Sparked is a python library and an application runner in once. Some of its features follow here:
        
         * Robust startup and restart of the program; if it crashes, it's started again.
         * Logging: keeps a rotated logfile for debugging purposes.
         * Pidfile management for making sure your app starts only once.
         * A GUI status window (based on GTK) for monitoring the state of the application and the state of the system (network, power supply, ...). Easy to add your own monitors.
         * Fullscreen graphics display for creating interactive displays, based on the clutter library.
         * Eventing system for broadcasting messages between spark modules.
         * A state machine for guiding the application through different states, with callback functions.
