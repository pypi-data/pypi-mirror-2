        Requirements
        ------------
        
        django_bfm extensively uses HTML5 techniques, so modern browser is required, see Tested Browsers section.

        Usage/Install

        * `easy_install django_bfm` or `pip install django_bfm` or download package, extract it, and copy django_bfm into your project directory
        * Add `'django_bfm',` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.
        * Add `url(r'^files/', include('django_bfm.urls')),` to `urlpatterns` in urls.py
        * Access file manager at /files/browse/
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        Variables in settings.py, that influence way, how BFM works.
        
        * `BFM_MEDIA_DIRECTORY`(if not set `MEDIA_ROOT` is used) - absolute path to place, where uploaded files are.
        * `BFM_FILES_IN_PAGE`(default - `20`) - integer. Tells BFM, how much files to show in one page.
        
        Things to note
        --------------
        
        * You must be logged as staff user to use file manager
        * It's very young project
