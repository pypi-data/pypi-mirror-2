        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Modern browser - BFM relies on a bunch of HTML5 features.
        - Django 1.3 (Not tested with 1.2 and below)
        
        Usage/Install
        -------------
        
        - Install it with either of:
            + ``pip install django_bfm``
            + ``easy_install django_bfm``
            + You can also put django_bfm directory directly into your project directory, if you want.
        - Add following to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project settings.py.
        
            'django_bfm',
        
        - Add following to ``urlpatterns`` in urls.py
        
            url(r'^files/', include('django_bfm.urls')),
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        Variables in settings.py, that influence behavior of BFM. `Wiki <https://github.com/simukis/django-bfm/wiki/Settings>`_ has more extensive explanation, so you may want to look at it.
        
        - ``BFM_MEDIA_DIRECTORY`` (if not set, then ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is used) - absolute path to directory, where uploaded files are.
        - ``BFM_MEDIA_URL`` (may use ``MEDIA_URL`` as value) - Let's BFM to construct clickable links to files.
        - ``BFM_FILES_IN_PAGE`` (default - ``20``) - integer. Tells BFM, how much files to show in one page.
        - ``BFM_COUNT_DIR_CONTENTS`` (default - ``False``) - boolean. Tells BFM, if it should count files in directory and show them as directory size.
        - ``LOGIN_URL`` - user will be redirected there if not logged in.
        
        Things to note
        --------------
        
        - You must be logged as staff user to use file manager
        - If you're not logged in, then you will be redirected to login page at ``settings.LOGIN_URL``
        - It's young project
