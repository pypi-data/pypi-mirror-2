Introduction
============

collective.cas4plone is an implementation of the CAS single-sign-on for 
the Pluggable Authentication Service. It is a fork of the Products.CAS4PAS 
product. This fork became necessary, because we were not able to reach the 
package maintainer of Product.CAS4PAS for quite some time. 

Versions
========

The plugin now adapts itself dinamically to the session management schema of Plone3 and Plone4.
