Introduction
============

collective.cas4plone is an implementation of the CAS single-sign-on for 
the Pluggable Authentication Service. It is a fork of the Products.CAS4PAS 
product. This fork became necessary, because we were not able to reach the 
package maintainer of Product.CAS4PAS for quite some time. 

Versions
========

For Plone 3 and older, please use version 1.0a1.

For Plone 4 and newer, use 1.0a2.
