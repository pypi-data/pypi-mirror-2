        # What is this?
        
        This is a small project that I made because I wanted a flexible method for aliasing extra URLs to different objects. It's provides a more flexible method for making a URL direct django to display the page for any Model that has a get_absolute_url method.
        
        As an example, if you were to create a "Page" model that simply described a page on a website - you could link it to the URL model in django-aliases and you would end up with a version of django's flatpages module that had added support for linking multiple URLs to a single item.
