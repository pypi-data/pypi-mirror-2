Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product integrates Products.sqlpfgadapter_ into collective.megaphone_. 
        
        For now, all it does is add "SQLPFGAdapter" to the addable types in a
        "Megaphone Action" (megaphone 2) or "Action Letter" (megaphone < 2).
        
        In the future, the sql storage might be a step in the megaphone wizard, which
        this product could provide.
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Requires Products.sqlpfgadapter >= 0.1a2.
        
        Should work on Plone 3 and Plone 4, collective.megaphone 1.x and 2.x.
        
        Tested on Plone 3.3.5 with collective.megaphone 2.0b1 and
        Products.sqlpfgadapter 0.1a2.
