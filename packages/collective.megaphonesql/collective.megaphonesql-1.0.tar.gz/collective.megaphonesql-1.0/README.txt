Introduction
============

This product integrates Products.sqlpfgadapter_ into collective.megaphone_. 

For now, all it does is add "SQLPFGAdapter" to the addable types in a
"Megaphone Action" (megaphone 2) or "Action Letter" (megaphone < 2).

In the future, the sql storage might be a step in the megaphone wizard, which
this product could provide.

Compatibility
=============

Requires Products.sqlpfgadapter >= 0.1a2.

Should work on Plone 3 and Plone 4, collective.megaphone 1.x and 2.x.

Tested on Plone 3.3.5 with collective.megaphone 2.0b1 and
Products.sqlpfgadapter 0.1a2.
