Note that this is not a full list of RTMPy's authors, however -- for that, you'd
need to look over the log messages to see all the patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to contact the
:doc:`dev mailing list <mailinglist>`, rather than mailing any of
these people directly.
