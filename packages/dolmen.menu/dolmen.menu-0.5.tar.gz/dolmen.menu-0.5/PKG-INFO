        dolmen.menu
        ===========
        
        ``dolmen.menu`` aims to provide the most flexible and explicit way to
        create and manage menus and their entries with Grok.
        
        You have to know that...
        ========================
        
        * ``dolmen.menu`` only works on Python 2.6.
        
        * ``dolmen.menu`` does not support sub-menus, out of the box. The
          implementation is left to your discretion.
        
        
        Components
        ==========
        
        ``dolmen.menu`` provides two components:
        
        * Menu : the menu implementation is based on the zope "content
          provider" notion and is using the ``grokcore.viewlet`` package.
        
        * Entry: a menu item is called an entry. It's a multi adapter that is
          registered for a Menu component.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        A menu component::
        
          >>> from dolmen import menu
        
          >>> class MyMenu(menu.Menu):
          ...     menu.title('My nice menu')
        
        A menu entry::
        
          >>> class MyMenuEntry(menu.Entry):
          ...     menu.order(1)
          ...     menu.name('a_direct_entry')
          ...     menu.title('My Entry')
          ...     menu.menu(MyMenu)
        
        
        Registration
        ============
        
        In order to use base Grok component as menu entries, we get two
        registration ways.
        
        class decorator
        ---------------
        
        A class decorator allows you to decorate any class, in order to
        register it as a menu entry::
        
          >>> import grokcore.view
        
          >>> @menu.menuentry(MyMenu)
          ... class TestEntry(grokcore.view.View):
          ...    def render(self):
          ...        return u"A simple entry"
        
        
        Module level martian directive
        ------------------------------
        
        A martian directive allows you register classes you can't decorate
        (from a foreign package, for instance), explicitly::
        
          >>> class SomeView(grokcore.view.View):
          ...    def render(self):
          ...        return u"I'm a view and I want to be a menu entry"
        
          >>> menu.global_menuentry(SomeView, MyMenu, order=2)
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.5 (2011-01-31)
        ----------------
        
        * ``dolmen.menu`` now works on the latest ``martian``. The treatment
          of the decorator has been deferred by the use of a module
          annotation. The registration is now done by a global grokker.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-12-24)
        ----------------
        
        * It is now possible to define a menu context, that is different of
          the rendering context. This allow delegated rendering, such as Root
          menus or other object-specific menus.
        
        
        0.3 (2010-06-04)
        ----------------
        
        * Corrected a bug where 'zope.Public' was evaluated as a "normal"
          permission. Now, the manager converts the permission into a
          CheckerPublic marker.
        
        * the ``filter`` method is now a generator.
        
        
        0.2 (2010-03-05)
        ----------------
        
        * Changed the way to fetch the menu CSS id.
        
        
        0.1 (2010-03-03)
        ----------------
        
        * Initial release.
