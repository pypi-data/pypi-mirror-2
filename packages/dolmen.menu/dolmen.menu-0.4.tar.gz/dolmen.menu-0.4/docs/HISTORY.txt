Changes
=======

0.4 (2010-12-24)
----------------

* It is now possible to define a menu context, that is different of
  the rendering context. This allow delegated rendering, such as Root
  menus or other object-specific menus.


0.3 (2010-06-04)
----------------

* Corrected a bug where 'zope.Public' was evaluated as a "normal"
  permission. Now, the manager converts the permission into a
  CheckerPublic marker.

* the ``filter`` method is now a generator.


0.2 (2010-03-05)
----------------

* Changed the way to fetch the menu CSS id.


0.1 (2010-03-03)
----------------

* Initial release.
