Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is a recipe to set up and configure Jenkins_ in a Jetty_ servlet
        container.
        
        .. _Jenkins : http://jenkins-ci.org/
        .. _Jetty : http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/
        
        
        Note
        ----
        
        The recipe is currently not compatible with Python 2.7 due to an
        incompatibility in the ``iw.recipe.template`` recipe used internally.
        
        
        Basic setup
        -----------
        
        A basic buildout configuration using this recipe looks like this::
        
            [buildout]
        
            parts =
                jetty-download
                jenkins-download
                jenkins
        
            [jetty-download]
            recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
            url = http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/7.2.2.v20101205/dist/jetty-distribution-7.2.2.v20101205.tar.gz
            strip-top-level-dir = true
        
            [jenkins-download]
            recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
            url = http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.397/jenkins.war
            download-only = true
        
            [jenkins]
            recipe = jarn.jenkins
            jetty-location = ${jetty-download:location}
            jenkins-location = ${jenkins-download:location}
        
        
        This will download both Jetty and Jenkins and create an executable Jetty
        environment in ``parts/jenkins``. It will also create a control script in
        ``bin/jenkins``. The name of the script is the name of the section.
        
        To test the setup run ``bin/jenkins fg`` and check the console output. By
        default this will run a Jetty server on port 8070. The jenkins instance is
        accessible in a browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:8070/jenkins/``.
        
        Jenkins will write all its log files into ``var/jenkins/log``. All its
        configuration including jobs and past runs will go into ``var/jenkins/data``.
        The directory name in ``var`` will have the name of the recipe section.
        
        
        Options
        -------
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        host
            Name or IP address of the Jetty server, e.g. ``some.server.com``.
            Defaults to ``127.0.0.1``.
        
        port
            Server port. Defaults to ``8070``.
        
        java-opts
            Optional. Parameters to pass to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used to
            run Jetty. Each option is specified on a separated line.
            If you run into memory problems it's typical to pass::
        
                [jenkins]
                ...
                java-opts =
                  -Xms512M
                  -Xmx1024M
                ...
