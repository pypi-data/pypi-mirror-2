Tests

Run specific level conformance tests with
nosetests -m '.*_level_1' ./tests/test_conformance.py


Note on "nth" expressions:
    For the expressions nth-child nth-last-child, I can find no logic or
    documentation stating how the arguments should be evaluated.
    As such, I'm not supporting anything but numeric arguments until more
    documentation is written.
