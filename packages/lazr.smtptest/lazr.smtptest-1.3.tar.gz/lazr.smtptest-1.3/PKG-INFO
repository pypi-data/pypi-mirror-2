        *************
        
        This is LAZR smtptest, a framework for testing SMTP-based applications and
        libraries.  It provides a real, live SMTP server that you can send messages
        to, and from which you can read those test messages.  This can be used to
        ensure proper operation of your applications which send email.

        NEWS for lazr.smtptest
        ======================
        
        1.3 (2011-06-07)
        ================
        
        - Make the test server thread-safe with other code that starts an asyncore
        loop.  Requires Python 2.6 or 2.7.
        
        - Be cleaner about stopping the server: before, it left sockets running
        ans simply cleared out the socket map.  In an associated change, the EXIT
        smtp command sends the reply first, and then shuts down the server, rather
        than the other way around.
        
        1.2 (2009-07-07)
        ================
        
        - [bug 393621] QueueServer.reset() was added to clear the message queue.  This
        is invoked by sending an SMTP RSET command to the server, or through
        Controller.reset().
        
        
        1.1 (2009-06-29)
        ================
        
        - [bug 391650] A non-public API was added to make QueueController more easily
        subclassable.
        
        
        1.0 (2009-06-22)
        ================
        
        - Initial release
