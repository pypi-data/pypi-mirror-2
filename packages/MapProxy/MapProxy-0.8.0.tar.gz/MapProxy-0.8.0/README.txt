MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates
and transforms data from existing map servers. Unlike other solutions, the OGC
WMS standard remains on client and server-side.

It acts as a middle-man between existing WMS servers (like MapServer or
GeoServer) and WMS clients. All existing web and desktop GIS applications can
be used, but also modern clients like OpenLayers or GoogleEarth.
