0.9.0.1 2010-11-15

- Fixed image quantization error.
- Fixed loading error when proj4 has no epsg:3857 definition. 

0.9.0 2010-10-18

- minor bug fixes

0.9.0rc1 2010-10-13

- new OpenLayers-based '/demo' service that shows all configured WMS/TMS layers
- display welcome message at '/' instead of 'not found' error
- less rigid feature info request parser (no error with missing style or format
  parameters). Use wms.strict to enable OCG compliant mode.
- updated tempita to 0.5

0.9.0b2 2010-09-20

- new minimize_meta_requests option
- moved python implementation dependent code to mapproxy.platform module

0.9.0b1 2010-08-30

- Improved support for EPSG:3857
- Source requests now never go beyond the grid BBOX even with meta_buffers/meta_tiles
- removed install_requires
  - flup: not required for all deployment options
  - tempita: now embeded
- now Python 2.7 compatible
- [mapproxy-seed] fixed libgdal loading on some Linux systems
- [mapproxy-seed] check for intersections on all levels
- add origin options to /tiles service to support Google Maps clients
- Improved PNG performance with PIL fastpng branch.
- New concurrent_requests option to limit requests for each source WMS server.
- minor bug fixes

0.9.0a1 2010-07-27

- new configuration format (merged proxy.yaml and service.yaml)
- refactoring of the caching (sources and layers)
- large refactoring of the package layout

- pyproj dependency is not required when libproj is available
- removed jinja dependency

- more options to define tile grids (min_res, max_res, etc.)

0.8.4 2010-08-01

- Extra newline at the end of all templates. Some deployment setups
  removed the last characters.
- Improved PNG performance with PIL fastpng branch.
- New concurrent_requests option to limit requests for each source WMS server.

0.8.3 2010-06-01

- Some bug fixes regarding feature info
- The configured resolutions are sorted

0.8.3rc2 2010-05-25

- HTTPS support with certificate verification and HTTP Basic-
  Authentication.
- New `use_direct_from_level` and `use_direct_from_res` options to
  disable caching for high resolutions.
- New `cache_tiles` source for more flexible tile-based sources
  Supports url templates like '/tiles?x=%(x)s&y=%(y)s&level=%(z)s'
  and Quadkeys as used by Bing-Maps. (as suggested by Pascal)
- You can limit the SRS of a source WMS with the `supported_srs`
  option. MapProxy will reproject between cached/requested SRS and
  the supported. This also works with direct layers, i.e. you can
  reproject WMS on-the-fly.

0.8.3rc1 2010-04-30

- new improved seed tool
  
  - seed polygon areas instead BBOX (from shapefiles, etc)
  - advanced seeding strategy
  - multiprocessing

- new link_single_color_images layer option. multiple "empty" tiles will
  be linked to the same image. (Unix only)
- fixed transparency for image parts without tiles
- log HTTP requests to servers regardless of the success
- made proj4 data dir configurable
- use same ordering of layers in service.yaml for capabilities documents
  (use list of dicts in configuration, see docs)
- performance improvements for requests with multiple layers and
  for layers with smaler BBOXs

0.8.2 2010-04-13

- no changes since 0.8.2rc1

0.8.2rc1 2010-04-01

- add fallback if PIL is missing TrueType support
- use zc.lockfile for locking
- improved logging:

  - log to stdout when using develop.ini
  - add %(here)s support in log.ini (changed from {{conf_base_dir}})
  - do not enable ConcurrentLogHandler by default

0.8.1 2010-03-25

- improved performance for simple image transformation
  (same srs and same resolution) #4

0.8.0 2010-03-22

- initial release
