Description: A TiddlyWeb plugin that provides the ability for users to score tiddlers.
        Can use for rating a tiddler (1-5 or +1/-1)
        
        usage:
        /tiddlyvoting/increment?title=<title>&bag=<bag>&value=<value>
        will increase the field tiddlyvotes.hits by <value> on the tiddler with title <title> in bag <bag>
        to work, the user must have read access to the bag <bag>
        
        You can define more complex behaviours by a tiddler called config::<bagname> in the tiddlyvoting bag.
