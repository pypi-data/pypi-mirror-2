        Attempts to port the undocumented open inviter API to python :)
        
        
        Understanding the PHP API
        -------------------------
        
        There are tons of files, but ``plugins/_hosted.plg.php`` overwrites almost
        everything.
        
        
        Hosted API
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        - Post XML to http://hosted.openinviter.com/hosted/hosted.php.
        - ::
        
        <import>
        <service>{{ service }}</service>
        <user>{$user}</user>
        <password>{$pass}</password>
        </import>
        
        - Authentication by private key, used to sign the XML with an md5 hash.
        - Supported services are requested and cached every now and then.
        
        
        TODO
        ^^^^
        
        - Can't get hosted services lookup to work (`services()` function)
        - Contacts and services for a function name is ugly... import_contacts
        might be better
