Description: What is mutant?
        ===============
        
        Mutant is a simple mutation testing framework for Python. It is currently only a proof of concept.
        
        What is mutation testing?
        -------------------------
        
        Mutation testing is a method for determining how complete your unit tests are. A small mutation is introduced into your code (e.g. a '<' is changed to a '<=') and then your tests are run. If your tests still pass then the code which was changed was (probably) not being completely tested.
        
        How does mutant work?
        ---------------------
        
        Given a module, mutant will iterate over all of its top-level functions, modifying their bytecode to introduce mutations and then making sure that the module's doctests fail.
        
        To run: ::
        
          $ python mutant.py <MODULE-NAME>
