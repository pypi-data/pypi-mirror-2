Description: 
        Yubico Client
        -------------
        
        The YubiKey generates a One-Time Passcode (OTP) that your application or 
        service, ensuring that only users with a valid YubiKey can gain 
        access. This api will help you to validate a OTP thus obtained against a yubico
        server. Also supports custom Yubikey validation servers in addition to the 
        default Yubico servers.
