Tests for Topic Functionality
=============================

Test PHC "topics" functionality. When sections are specified in the PHC
and use a "Topic Area: Section" pattern, they should allow us to use
the topic views.

First, some set-up:
    
    >>> from Products.Five import zcml
    >>> import Products
    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    
Setup our site with a PHC instance data provided in Data.py and utilities in CustomSetup.py

    >>> from Products.PloneHelpCenter.tests import CustomSetup
    >>> from Products.PloneHelpCenter.tests import Data
    >>> CustomSetup.CreateRootPHC(self,self.portal)
    'Created a PHC instance in the root of your Plone site.'

Check PHC Sections Vocabulary Setup
    >>> hc = self.portal.hc
    >>> hc.sectionsVocab
    (u'Topic1', u'Topic1: Section1', u'Topic1: Section2 - \xe1',
    u'Topic2', u'Topic2: Section Z', u'Topic2: Section A')

CreateRootPHC creates a sections vocabulary for the how-to folder, so we'll
need to clear it to test global sections.
    >>> htf = hc['how-to']
    >>> htf.setSectionsVocab([])

Now, let's see if we can get sections inherited from the PHC object.    
    >>> len(htf.getSectionsVocab())
    6

Exercise the folder view's getItemsByAudiencesAndSections method.
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((htf, htf.REQUEST), name=u'hcf_view')
    >>> len( view.getItemsByAudiencesAndSections() )
    1

Exercise the folder view's getItemsBySections method.
We don't expect to find anything since the only existing howto
isn't in a current section.
    >>> len( view.getItemsBySections() )
    0
