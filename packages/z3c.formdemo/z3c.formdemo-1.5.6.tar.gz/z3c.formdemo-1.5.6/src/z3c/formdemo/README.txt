This package provides different sample for the z3c.form  and z3c.formui 
packages.

If you run the Zope3 server at port 8080, you can access the different demos
with two skins. The Z3CFormDemo skin uses the div based form layout and is 
accessible via: http://localhost:8080/++skin++Z3CFormDemo/ and the 
Z3CTableFormDemo skin uses the table based form layout and is accessible via:
http://localhost:8080/++skin++Z3CFormDemo/. Both skin offer a index.html page
with a list of demo pages.
