Description: =====================================================
        Demo Applications for ``z3c.form`` and ``z3c.formui``
        =====================================================
        
        This package contains several small demo applications for the ``z3c.form`` and
        ``z3c.formui`` packages.
        
        * TABLE- versus DIV-based layout of all widgets.
        
        * A simple Hello World message application demonstrating the easiest way to
        write add, edit and display forms.
        
        * A simple calculator showing the flexibility of the new action declaration
        framework by declaring different classes of buttons.
        
        * A linear wizard shows off the sub-form capabilities of z3c.form. It also
        demonstrates how one can overcome the short-coming of an object widget.
        
        * A simple table/spreadsheet that allows adding and editing as simple content
        object. This demo also shows the usage of forms and ``zc.table`` at the same
        time.
        
        Running the Demo out of the box
        -------------------------------
        
        You can also run the demo directly without manually installing Zope 3::
        
        $ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/z3c.formdemo/trunk formdemo
        $ cd formdemo
        $ python bootstrap.py
        $ ./bin/buildout
        $ ./bin/demo fg
        
        Then access the demo site using:

        - Feature: Added an image button to the widgets demo.

        - Refactoring: Adjusted all tests to work with the new layout format in formui
        and form.
        
        
        Version 1.4.0 (2007-08-24)
        --------------------------
        
        - Refactoring: Update CSS classes to reflect changes in ``z3c.form``.
        
        
        Version 1.3.0 (2007-07-18)
        --------------------------
        
        - Feature: Created functional tests for the demos.
        
        - Feature: Moved all application ZCML declarations into a ZCML file called
        ``application.zcml``.
        
        
        Version 1.2.0 (2007-06-29)
        --------------------------

        - Feature: Made ``bytesField`` and ``passwordField`` non-required, since they

        submit, which can be annoying when playing around.
        
        - Feature: New "Questionnaire" demo shows how to use groups effectively. It
        also demonstrates how the label of buttons and widgets can be changed using

        releases of ``z3c.form`` simply ignored missing fields, but the latest
        version reports the error. Thanks to Luke Miller for the report.

        - Feature: New "Address Book" demo that demonstrates more complex use cases,
        such as subforms, composite widgets, and mappings/lists
        
        
        Version 1.0.0 (2007-05-24)
