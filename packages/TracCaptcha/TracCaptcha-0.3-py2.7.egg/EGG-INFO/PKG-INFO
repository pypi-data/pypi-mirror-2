Description: 
        TracCaptcha is a Trac plugin to embed a captcha in the ticket page in addition 
        to Trac's regular permission checks so that spammers are kept out.
        
        **"It just works":** Installation and configuration is very simple, just 
        install the egg and put two configuration options in your trac.ini. No 
        database changes required.
        
        **Batteries included:** The popular reCAPTCHA system is supported out of the box.
        Technically it's a plugin - if you don't like it you're free to use any other 
        plugin while still leverage the benefits from the general captcha 
        infrastructure.
        
        **Does not annoy users:** After the user entered the captcha once, he does not have
        to solve the captcha again for the same ticket when he just clicks 'preview'.
        Also you can configure exempt certain users or groups (e.g. 'all authenticated 
        users') from the captchas just by using Trac's permission system.
        
        **Easy to extend:** Protecting an additional page with a captcha is very 
        simple. Implementing captchas for the ticket module took only 20 lines of code! 
        Captchas for the DiscussionPlugin needed 21 lines of code!
        
        **Easy to write custom captchas:** If you don't like reCAPTCHA, you can still 
        use the generic infrastructure with all its features: You implement the code to 
        generate the captcha and validate the user's input. TracCaptcha will take care 
        of displaying your plugin in all supported pages!
