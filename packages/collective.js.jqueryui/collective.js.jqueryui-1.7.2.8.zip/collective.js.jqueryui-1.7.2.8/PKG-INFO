Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Integration of jqueryui in Plone, like collective.js.jquery.
        
        It is different from collective.jqueryui in many ways:
        
        * no skin dirs (js and css are in resource dirs)
        * no all the bunch of files and documentations from original jqueryui
        * this one is minified
        * just add all jqueryui to portal_js, and default css to portal_css (if you 
          apply the profile)

        Notes
        =====
        
        There are three profiles in this package:
        
        - ``default``: use this one with Plone 3.2/3.3 if you don't use
          plone.app.jquerytools. It will replace the jQuery version in Plone by
          the one included in collective.js.jquery because Plone <= 3.3rc2 include
          an old version of jQuery (1.2) and jqueryui 1.7 requires jQuery 1.3+.
        
        - ``withjqtoolsplone3``: use this one if you include plone.app.jquerytools
          yourself in a Plone 3.2, this profile installs a jqueryui library
          without the tabs plugin which conflicts with plone.app.jquerytools.
          It will replace the jQuery version in Plone by the one included in
          collective.js.jquery.
        
        - ``withjqtools``: use this one if you use Plone 3.3/4. It will keep the
          jQuery version included in Plone and is compatible with
          plone.app.jquerytools. You need to include plone.app.jquerytools yourself
          on Plone 3.3.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.7.2.8 
        --------------------
        
        * credits [kiorky]
        
        1.7.2.7 (2010-03-16)
        --------------------
        
        * ``withjqtools`` profile doesn't apply the collective.js.jquery profile
          anymore. So you can use it with Plone 3.3/4, it will not replace the
          jQuery version included in Plone.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * Add ``withjqtoolsplone3`` profile which is the same as ``withjqtools`` but
          installs the collective.js.jquery profile so the jQuery library is replaced
          by a newer one. Use this profile only on Plone 3.2 with plone.app.jquerytools.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        1.7.2.6 (2010-02-02)
        --------------------
        
        * Add profile ``withjqtools``, a profile registering the jquery UI bundle
          without the ``tabs`` plugin. This plugin conflicts with the same plugin
          from jquery tools. Note that ``plone.app.jquerytools`` must be availabe in
          your system, since it's profile is applied as dependency. It's not added
          to the setup dependencies of this package. [rnix]
