        slc.linguatools offers a set of functions that are designed to make life easier
        when dealing with multilingual sites, especially those with several different languages.
        
        Often you have the requirement that you want to do the same action for all translations of an object. In a site with ten, twenty or more languages, doing this manually is not an option any more.
        
        
        Requirements and Installation
        =============================
        
        This package only works and makes sense if you have LinguaPlone installed.
        
        Add "slc.linguatools" to the eggs and zcml sections of your buildout configuration. After running buildout and restarting your instance, go to the Site Setup -> Add-on Products, choose slc.linguatools and click "install".
        
        A tab named "Lingua Tools" will then appear on all translatable objects.
        
        Functions
        =========
        
        slc.linguatools offers assistance for the following use cases:
        
        * Set title or description:
        Set the title / description on all translations;
        either directly to the string you entered, or based on an i18n label and
        domain
        
        * Rename an object
        Rename all translations to the id (short name) you entered
        
        * Set portlets
        Propagate the portlet settings of the canonical object to all
        translations, either for all slots or the one you chose. Block / unblock
        portlet inheritance per slot.
        
        * Workflow
        Publish all translations
        
        * Catalog reindex
        Reindex all translations of an object
        
        * Deleter
        Delete all translations of an object
        
        * Cut and paste
        Cut all translations of an object and paste them to another folder
        
        * Property handling
        Set a property with id, type and value on all translations.
        Example: Set string property "layout" to "@@my-shiny-view". Delete an
        existing property.
        
        * Marker interfaces
        Set or remove a marker interface on all translations of an object. The
        interfaces available for setting and removing are provided by a vocabulary
        and are the same as on the "Interfaces" tab in the ZMI.
        
        * Subtyping (if p4a.subtyper is installed)
        Set a subtype on all translations; remove a subtype
        
        * Translate an object
        Create a translation of the current object for all available languages.
        The AT attributes that should be copied over can be selected. If the object
        is a Collection, then all criteria are copied as well. This function can
        also be used to copy values of AT attributes and collection criteria to
        already existing translations.
        
        Versions
        ========
        
        The first version of this tool featured a manually written BrowserView. During the Plone-Conference 2009 sprint, a second version that uses z3c form was written. This is the version visible by default via the "Lingua Tools" tab. The original version is still accessible under @@linguatools-old.

        slc.linguatools Changelog
        =========================
        
        1.3.5 (2010-03-31)
        ------------------
        
        - In plone.z3cform version 0.5.8 a major change was introduced that affects our
        product. By overwriting update() and contents() of FormWrapper, we enable
        support for versions >=0.5.8; with an ugly hack in contents(), we maintain
        support for versions <=0.5.7 (thomasw)
        - Fixed broken doctest for changing the workflow, introduced in 1.3.3 (thomasw)
        - The AvailableIdsVocabulary now only returns translatable items (thomasw)
        - New functionality: Add and remove marker interfaces (thomasw)
        - Don't show the canonical lang in the vocabulary of avaiable langs (thomasw)
        
        1.3.4 (2010-02-09)
        ------------------
        
        - In the AvailableWorkflowTransitions vocabulary, return all available
        transitions of a workflow, not just those available for the canonical's
        state. The canonical might be published, while some translations are still
        private (thomasw)
        
        1.3.3 (2010-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Reworked workflow handling. Instead of only "publish", now all transactions
        available on the current object can be triggered (thomasw)
        - "Translate this" now has an additional language field, so that only a subset
        of the available languages may be chosen (thomasw)
        - Ran the pep8 script and fixed most issues (thomasw)
        
        
        1.3.2 (2009-12-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix in linguatools.css: missing closing bracket. Thanks for the
        heads-up, do3cc! (thomasw)
        
        1.3.1 (2009-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Be more relaxed with version pinning needed for plone.app.z3cform (thomasw)
        
        1.3 (2009-11-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Major revamp at Plone Conference 2009 sprint: moved from static BrowserView
        to z3c form; brushed up test coverage; clearer interface; more user-friendly,
        less typing necessary; easier to plug in new functionality (cillian, jcbrand,
        pilz, thomasw, Andreas Schmid)
        
        1.2.5 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - make sure that lang is ascii when using it to create objectids. Otherwise we get an infinite recursion (pilz)
        - D'oh another bug in "block portlets", this time in the status message (thomasw)
        - better status reporting for translateThis; collection criteria are now also copied when
        "translation exists" is ticked; more graceful handling for unknown fields (thomasw)
        
        1.2.4 (2009-10-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Continuing my fix for ambiguous variable name (thomasw)
        
        
        1.2.3 (2009-10-25)
        ------------------
        
        - 2 bugs fixed for "block portlets": ambiguous variable name, wrong button name (thomasw)
        
        1.2.2 (2009-10-08)
        ------------------
        
        - 2 bugfixes in cutAndPaste (don't despair if object is not available) (thomasw)
        - Added a contenview tab for Lingua Tools on ITranslatable objects (jcbrand)
        - In lingatools.pt moved the legends into the fieldsets, added labels and reorganised a bit (jcbrand)
        - Added new option to remove subtypes (jcbrand)
        - Use the default plone status messages for messaging and added event.log logging (jcbrand)

        TODO
        ****
        
        * Find and use an object-picker widget for "Cut & Paste" - having to type the
        destination path is ugly.
        
        * Distinguish between global functions (e.g. Set title) and those that only
        make sense on a folder (e.g. Delete).
        
        * Add a configuration page in the control panel so that the manager can select
        the available functions (e.g. exclude the Marker Interface function)
