An example user registration plugin for TiddlyWeb.

What this does is validate an OpenID and then create a
TiddlyWeb user of that OpenID and assign a Role to it.
This allows the system to go beyond a Policy of 'ANY'
to one of 'R:MEMBER'. This is a way to provide member
access to people with openIds while not allowing all
openids.

It uses a few optional configuration settings:

    register.role: The role assigned to newly registered
        users. Defaults to "MEMBER".
    register.start_href: The link to send users to after
        they have registered. Defaults to "/".
    register.start_title: The title of the link. Defaults
        to "Get Started".
    register.blacklist: A list of openids to never allow
        to register. Defaults to an empty list.

Because tiddlywebplugins.templates is being used, the 
register.html and registered.html templates may be overriden
per instance by creating a templates directory in the instance
directory and putting new versions of the templates in there.
