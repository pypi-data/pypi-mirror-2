Can't locate template
---------------------

Formish requires Mako in order to render the default template. However, this is not required and hence not installed by default. 'easy_install mako' to possibly get past this.

The required version of setuptools 
----------------------------------

Try 'easy_install -U setuptools' and then try installing again
