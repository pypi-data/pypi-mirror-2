Hook and extension to spellcheck Mercurial commit messages

=== Overview ===

Using `hg log -k` you can filter the log and search for keywords. This can be made difficult or impossible if there are lots of spelling mistakes in commit messages.

To check all commits for spelling mistakes, and interactively edit them when
they occur, use the `hgspellcheck` extension.

Use the included hook to prevent the addition of changesets that have spelling errors in their commit messages.

=== Configuration ===

To check all commits for spelling mistakes, and interactively edit them when
they occur, add the extension to the "extensions" section of your .hgrc.

{{{

[extensions]
hgspellcheck=

}}}

To reject all inbound commits that have spelling mistakes, add the hook
on "pretxnchangegroup".

{{{

[hooks]
# Reject all inbound changesets with spelling errors in their commit
# messages
pretxnchangegroup = python:hgspellcheck.hook
 
# Refuse to create changesets in the local repository if their commit
# messages contain spelling errors; this works for any commands that
# create changesets (e.g. commit, qnew, qrecord)
pretxncommit = python:hgspellcheck.hook

}}}
