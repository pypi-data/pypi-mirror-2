- Remove 'Child Folder' add/edit interfaces.  The type still remains

  [claytron]

- Added uninstall profile and hooked it up to the Quickinstaller
  [claytron]

- Added subtyper.xml to the uninstall profile that will deactivate
  all 'Child Sites' in the portal.  This depends on p4a.subtyper
  code that has not yet been released.  This also solves the
  export/import issue
