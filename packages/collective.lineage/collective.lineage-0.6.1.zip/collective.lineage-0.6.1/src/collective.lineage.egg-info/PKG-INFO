        Lineage is a Plone product that allows subfolders of a Plone site to appear as autonomous Plone sites to the everyday user. This hub and spoke structure allows site administrators to easily manage multiple, seemingly independent, sub-entity websites in one Plone. Furthermore, the "parent" site can access and view the content in all the "child" sites while the child sites only view their own content. The parent site can also syndicate chosen content to the selected child sites. Lineage is less complex and easier to manage than a cluster of nested Plone sites but gives users all the same benefits.
        
        Lineage can be used within a large organization to manage multiple microsites, such as school district sites, university departments, corporate product sites, public library satellites,  professional association events, and more.
        
        Lineage works with Plone 3 and Plone 4.

        Detailed Documentation
        ======================
        
        After you've bootstrapped your buildout, installed all the dependencies, and installed Lineage via Site Setup -> Add on Products, you are ready to go.
        
        Add a Child Site
        
        1. In Plone, go to the place where you want to add a new child site.
        2. Click Add New, and add a `Folder`.
        3. Enter the title and description for the Child site.
        4. Click Save.
        5. Click the `actions` drop down and select `Child Site`. This "activates" the child site behavior.
        6. The Plone site now has a child site. A drop down will appear at the top of the Plone to the left of the site actions area. A user can select the parent site or any child sites from this drop down.
        
        
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        First step
        ----------
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can add ``collective.lineage``
        to your instance part::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        Plone
        collective.lineage
        # the next 2 lines are not necessary
        # if you are using lineage-0.6+
        zcml =
        collective.lineage
        
        
        If you are using Plone 3.2
        ---------------------------
        
        You will need to use the code added for `PLIP 234`.
        To do so, you'll have to add the branches of the eggs for the plip::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        plip234-branches
        
        [plip234-branches]
        recipe = infrae.subversion
        as_eggs = true
        urls =
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes Plone
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.layout/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.layout
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.portlets/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.portlets
        
        If you are using Plone 3.1.7
        ----------------------------
        
        You will need to use the branches created by duffyd (note the reference
        to ``${plone317-products:location}`` in the ``products`` value of the
        ``instance`` section must be first in the list)::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        plone317-products
        plone317-eggs
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        products =
        ${plone317-products:location}
        ...
        
        [plone317-products]
        recipe = infrae.subversion
        urls =
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/branches/duffyd-inavigationroot-fixes-317/ Plone
        
        [plone317-eggs]
        recipe = infrae.subversion
        as_eggs = true
        urls =
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.layout/branches/duffyd-inavigationroot-fixes-317/ plone.app.layout
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.portlets/branches/duffyd-inavigationroot-fixes-317/ plone.app.portlets
        
        
        Last step
        ---------
        
        Now you can re-run your buildout to get the all the dependencies::
        
        $ bin/buildout
        
        Once your buildout is finished, you can start up your instance and install Lineage via the ``Add-on Products`` configlet in site setup.
        
        .. _PLIP 234: http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234
        
        Migration from 0.1 to the latest version
        ========================================
        
        In versions of collective.lineage that are greater than 0.1, the Child Folder type
        has been deprecated and you can know activate a folder using
        the subtyper action when you are on a Folder.
        
        An upgrade step takes care of migrating the old Child Folder
        to Folder. Make sure to backup your data and then, once you
        have updated your instance to use the latest collective.lineage,
        reinstall "Lineage", it will migrate the items automatically.
        
        Note: we are assuming that the Child Folder and the Folder workflows
        are the same.
        
        Working on the trunk of lineage
        ===============================
        
        To work on the trunk of lineage, do the following::
        
        $ svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.lineage/trunk/ lineage-trunk
        $ cd lineage-trunk
        $ python2.4 bootstrap.py
        $ bin/buildout -v
        $ bin/instance fg
        
        Then:
        
        - go to  http://localhost:8080/manage (admin/admin)
        - add a plone site
        - quickinstall lineage in the new plone site
        - create a folder and subtype it to see if everything works fine
        
        You can run the tests in debug mode with the following command::
        
        $ bin/test -D

        [clayton]
        
        0.3 - (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - getting the unit testing to work with plone4 and allowing
        childsite editing with plone4, refs #16 [tbesluau]
        
        - updated README.txt with useful links [lucielejard]
        
        - added tests for the uninstall of lineage [lucielejard]

        we don't use it anymore, updated the history with the recent
        changes [lucielejard]
        
        - moved the registration of the utility in component registry so
        it gets registered locally, this fixes #5 [lucielejard]
        
        - added a deprecation warning on the Child Folder type
        [lucielejard]
        
        - put back some old zcml so the Child Folder migration can be tested
        [lucielejard]
        
        - added a test for the migration from 0.1 to >0.1
        [lucielejard]
        
        - updated the version in metadata.xml for the upgrade step
        [lucielejard]
        
        - made the Child Folder type not globally addable
        [lucielejard]

        [claytron]
        
        - Moving over to an 'activation' based system instead of having a
        'Child Folder' type.  Now a folder will have the option for a
        subtype named 'Child Site'.
        http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/3
        http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/1
        [claytron]
        
        - Remove 'Child Folder' add/edit interfaces.  The type still remains
        so that we can do a migration.
        [claytron]
        
        - Added uninstall profile and hooked it up to the Quickinstaller
        [claytron]
        
        - Added subtyper.xml to the uninstall profile that will deactivate
        all 'Child Sites' in the portal.  This depends on p4a.subtyper
        code that has not yet been released.  This also solves the
        export/import issue
        http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/2
        [claytron]
        
        - Added a subscriber to create the local component site (this was
        in the 'Child Folder' type before)
        [claytron]
        
        0.2 - (XXXX-XX-XX)
        ------------------
        
        - Doc clarifications
        [claytron]
        
        0.1 - (2009-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial public release
        
        Special Thanks
        ==============
        
        Six Feet Up would especially like to thank Martin Aspeli for his inspiration and the Duke Clinical Research Institute group for project funding.
