=========

0.6.1 - (2011-01-12)
--------------------

  [lucielejard]

  [lucielejard]

- Fixed the upgrade so that when we grab the layout of a folder, it does not 
  get it using acquisition if it doesn't have one, fixes #18
  [lucielejard]

- Copy over sharing settings from child folder to new folder, fixes #38
  [anthonygerrard]

- Fix by not renaming the child folder, instead create new folder with temp 
  id and rename that to the child folder id after the child folder has been
  deleted, fixes #37
  [anthonygerrard]

- Adding a failing test case for #37 here as it is a serious bug but I have 
  no idea how to fix it
  [anthonygerrard]

- In lineage 0.1 child folders never inherited their parent's portlets so 
  always block parent portlets when migrating, fixes #34
  [anthonygerrard]

- Added a warning if portlet manager is not available on the new folder, 
  fixes #35
  [anthonygerrard]

- Copy portlet assignments from and blocking settings across on migration, 
  fixes #34
  [anthonygerrard]

- Refactor tests so that migration tests are in their own class and so can 
  have common setup logic
  [anthonygerrard]
 
- Read the default page of the child folder before conversion and then set 
  it afterwards, fixes #18
  [anthonygerrard]

  childsite editing with plone4, refs #16 [tbesluau]

- updated README.txt with useful links [lucielejard]

- updated the list of items todo, removed rolemap.xml since
  we don't use it anymore, updated the history with the recent
  changes [lucielejard]

- moved the registration of the utility in component registry so 
  it gets registered locally, this fixes #5 [lucielejard]

- added a deprecation warning on the Child Folder type
  [lucielejard]

- put back some old zcml so the Child Folder migration can be tested
  [lucielejard]

- added a test for the migration from 0.1 to >0.1

  [lucielejard]

  [lucielejard]

  automatically on reinstall
  [lucielejard]

- Set up for i18n translations
  [claytron]

- Moving over to an 'activation' based system instead of having a
  'Child Folder' type.  Now a folder will have the option for a
  subtype named 'Child Site'.
  http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/3
  http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/1
  [claytron]

- Remove 'Child Folder' add/edit interfaces.  The type still remains
  so that we can do a migration.
  [claytron]

- Added uninstall profile and hooked it up to the Quickinstaller
  [claytron]

- Added subtyper.xml to the uninstall profile that will deactivate
  all 'Child Sites' in the portal.  This depends on p4a.subtyper
  code that has not yet been released.  This also solves the
  export/import issue
  http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/2
  [claytron]

- Added a subscriber to create the local component site (this was
  in the 'Child Folder' type before)
