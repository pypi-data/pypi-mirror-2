Detailed Documentation
======================

After you've bootstrapped your buildout, installed all the dependencies, and installed Lineage via Site Setup -> Add on Products, you are ready to go. 

Add a Child Site

1. In Plone, go to the place where you want to add a new child site.
2. Click Add New, and add a `Folder`.
3. Enter the title and description for the Child site. 
4. Click Save.
5. Click the `actions` drop down and select `Child Site`. This "activates" the child site behavior.
6. The Plone site now has a child site. A drop down will appear at the top of the Plone to the left of the site actions area. A user can select the parent site or any child sites from this drop down.
