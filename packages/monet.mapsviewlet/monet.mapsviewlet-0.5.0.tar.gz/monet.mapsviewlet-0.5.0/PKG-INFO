        Every Plone content, with a "*Location*" data can display a Google's Map inside a viewlet. The location data
        must be a valid address that Google Maps service can understand (like "*Piazza Grande, Modena, Italy*").
        
        The viewlet is placed (by default) below the content.
        
        To finally enable the map you need also to access a new option under the "*Action*" menu. Use this
        same option to disable the map.
        
        You need to `configure the Google Key`__ in the *googlemaps_key* property under the *monet_properties*
        sheet (added when you'll install the product).
        If your Plone site can be reached from more than one hostname, add a key for every possible ones.

        KML
        ---
        
        Also you can handle `KML`__ file using again the Google APIs.
        You must simply add Plone files with KML extensions to the **related contents** section of a document
        where the map is enabled.
        
        __ http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/whatiskml.html
        
        When you have KML data to show, you can also use a new portlet that will help users to enable/disable
        single KML data from the map.
        
        .. Note::
           You can use and test KML features only with online site. When working locally all KML features simply
           don't work.
