        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages the jQuery `jgrowl plugin`_ for
        `hurry.resource`_. 
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        .. _`jgrowl plugin`: http://stanlemon.net/projects/jgrowl.html
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import hurry.jgrowl from ``hurry.jgrowl`` and ``.need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          from hurry.jgrowl import jgrowl
        
          .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
          jgrowl.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and
        ``hurry.resource``, and making sure that the original resources
        (shipped in the ``jgrowl-build`` directory in ``hurry.jgrowl``)
        are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and the Zope
        Toolkit. If you depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your
        ``setup.py``, the above example should work out of the box. Make sure
        to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``.
