Description: Provides an interactive shell aka console inside your doctest case.
        
        The console looks exact like in a doctest-case and you can copy and paste
        code from the shell into your doctest. It feels as you are in the test case
        itself. Its not pdb, it's a python shell.
        
        In your doctest you can invoke the shell at any point by calling::
        
        >>> interact( locals() )
        
        To make your testrunner interlude aware following is needed:
        
        1) import interlude
        
        2) suite = DocFileSuite( ..., globs=dict(interact=interlude.interact), ...)
