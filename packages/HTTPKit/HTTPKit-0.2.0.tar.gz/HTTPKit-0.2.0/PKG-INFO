        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Updated so that we use ``bag.environ`` and ``bag.http_response`` instead of
          ``bag.http.environ`` and ``bag.http.response``
        * Changed ``bag.http.input`` to ``bag.input`` and ``bag.http.query`` to 
          ``bag.query`` so that nested pipe names are no longer needed
