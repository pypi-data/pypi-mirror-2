        Changes

        0.2.1
        -----
        
        2010-11-14
        ----------
        
        * Changed the behaviour of the ``input`` service to get more access to environ
        * Raise an ``AttributeError`` if you set an attribute of the ``http_response``
          service which doesn't exist
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        2010-10-13
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Updated so that we use ``bag.environ`` and ``bag.http_response`` instead of
          ``bag.http.environ`` and ``bag.http.response``
        * Changed ``bag.http.input`` to ``bag.input`` and ``bag.http.query`` to 
          ``bag.query`` so that nested pipe names are no longer needed
