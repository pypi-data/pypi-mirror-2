js.jquery_jstree
****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery JsTree`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery JsTree`: http://www.jstree.com/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_jstree``) are published to some URL.
