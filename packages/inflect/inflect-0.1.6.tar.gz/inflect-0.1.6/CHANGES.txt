ver 0.1.6 (2010-07-03)

* add method sinoun() to generate the singular of a plural noun. Phew!

* add changes from new Perl version: 1.892

* start adding tests from Perl version

* add test to check sinoun(plnoun(word)) == word
  Can now use word lists to check these methods without needing to have
  a list of plurals. ;-)

* fix die -> dice
