Things that need doing:

* Some style and pizazz (aka css)!
* Tests for views and funtional tests
* Caching of view methods.
* Views for performing moderation tasks TTW, currently moderation is email
  only.
* Views for managing bounced and disabled senders as well as other fun
  MailBoxer gadgets.
* The List Lookup utility needs a more generic way to use the envelope
  recipient.  Currently it finds the list to send to based on To + CC, this is
  fine except when a mail is addressed to two lists handled by the same server
  it will likely be sent to the first matched list twice.  On postfix this is
  not the case because the proprietary x-original-to header is used there (so
  use postfix or map your lists directly to the appropriate url for now if 
  this is a likely scenario for you).
* We need a nice z3 widget for lists, the one that comes with z3 is terribly
  broken.
* Policies for determining who can join a list (if anyone), currently all
  lists can be subscribed to by anyone.
* Broader Subscription adapters which hook into Group/Team/Portal-wide
  membersip.
* Parsing of message bodies into nicely formatted HTML (e.g. using
  <blockquote> and linkifying obvious urls).
* Use Dieter Maurer's AdvancedQuery to make some of the queries faster/more
  predictably ordered.
* Some architecture documentation.
* Whatever else people my find useful or necessary, especially those people
  who have funded this work. ;)
