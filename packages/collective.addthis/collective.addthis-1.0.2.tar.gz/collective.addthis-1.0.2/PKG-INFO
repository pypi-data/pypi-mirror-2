Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        *collective.addthis* is a simple Plone addon which brings `addthis.com`_
        services to Plone pages under document actions.
        
        *collective.addthis* has customizable addthis url (pointing to your addthis
        username) and addthis javascript url (pointing to addthis javascript url).
        Those settings have default values which I got from `addthis.com`_ so that testing
        collective.addthis is easy. Those values are recommended to be changed if you're
        actually planning to use this addon.
        
        There are few other similar addons for Plone (`collective.prettysociable`_,
        `collective.plonebookmarklets`_, `sc.social.bookmarks`_) which does the same job,
        but they were too much customized to some direction to suit some specific needs.
        New `collective.sharerizer`_ is closest relative to *collective.addthis*. Differences
        between these two are that collective.sharerizer overrides document_actions where
        collective.addthis is placed under them in it's own viewlet.
