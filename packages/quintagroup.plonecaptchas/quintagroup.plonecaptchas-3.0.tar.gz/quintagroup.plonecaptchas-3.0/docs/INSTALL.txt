============

Buildout
--------

To install quintagroup.plonecaptchas to your buildout-based project:

* Add ``quintagroup.plonecaptchas`` to the list of eggs to install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    
* Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/instance restart
   
* Install ``Plone Captchas`` with Quickinstaller in Plone (Site Setup -> Add/Remove Products).

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.plonecaptchas-configure.zcml`` in your instance's ``/etc/package-includes`` directory. The file
should only contain this::

    <include package="quintagroup.plonecaptchas" />

* Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart

* Install ``Plone Captchas`` with Quickinstaller in Plone (Site Setup -> Add/Remove Products).
