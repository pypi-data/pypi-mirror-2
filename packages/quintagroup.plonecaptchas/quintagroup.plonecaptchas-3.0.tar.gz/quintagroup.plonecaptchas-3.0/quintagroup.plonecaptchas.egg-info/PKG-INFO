Description: Plone Captchas
        ==============
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas is a simple captchas implementation for Plone, designed
        for validation of human input in insecure forms. This is a standalone
        implementation which does not depend on captchas.net services.
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas adds captcha support to Plone, it works together with
        quintagroup.captcha.core package. http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.captcha.core
        
        With these products installed captchas will be added to Plone's 'Send this',
        'Contact Us' (/contact-info) forms, and Plone's default discussion mechanism:
        'Add Comment' and 'Reply' forms.
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas does not automatically plug to Plone's default registration
        (/join_form). You can make captcha plug to Plone's Join form via Zope Management Interface.
