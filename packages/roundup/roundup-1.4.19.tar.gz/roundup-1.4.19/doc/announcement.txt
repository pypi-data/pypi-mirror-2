I'm proud to release version 1.4.19 of Roundup which introduces some
minor features and, as usual, fixes some bugs:

Features:

- Xapian indexing improved: Slightly faster and slightly smaller database. 
  Closes issue2550687. Thanks to Olly Betts for the patch. (Bernhard Reiter)
- PostgreSQL backend minor improvement: database creation less likely to fail
  for PostgreSQL versions >= 8.1 as the table "postgres" is used by default.
  Closes issue2550543. Thanks to Kai Storbeck for the patch. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Allow HTMLRequest.batch to filter on other permissions than "View"
  (e.g. on the new "Search" permission") by adding a "permission"
  parameter. Thanks to Eli Collins for the patch. Closes issue2550699. (Ralf)

Fixed:

- Installation: Fixed an issue that prevented to use EasyInstall 
  and a Python egg. Thanks to Satchidanand Haridas for the patch and
  John Kristensen for testing it. (Bernhard Reiter)
- The PostgreSQL backend quotes database names now for CREATE and DROP, 
  enabling more exotic tracker names. Closes issue2550497. 
  Thanks to Sebastian Harl for providing the patch. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Updated the url to point to www.roundup-tracker.org in two places in the
  docs. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Do not depend on a CPython implementation detail anymore to make Roundup 
  more compatible with other Python implementations like PyPy.
  Closes issue2550707. Thanks to Christof Meerwald. (Bernhard Reiter, Richard)
- Yet another fix to the mail gateway, messages got *all* files of
  an issue, not just the new ones. Thanks to Rafal Bisingier for
  reporting and proposing a fix. The regression test was updated.
  (Ralf)
- Fix version numbers in upgrade documentation, the file-unlink defect
  was in 1.4.17 not 1.4.16. Thanks to Rafal Bisingier. (Ralf)
- Fix encoded email header parsing if multiple encoded and non-encoded
  parts are present. RFC2047 specifies that spacing is removed only
  between encoded parts, we always removed the space. Note that this bug
  was present before mail gateway refactoring :-) Thanks for thorough
  testing of mail gateway code by Rafal Bisingier. (Ralf)
- The "Retire" permission was not being registered. (Richard)
- Fix StringIO issue2550713: io.StringIO in newer versions of python
  returns unicode strings and expects a unicode string in the
  constructor. Unfortunately csv  doesn't handle unicode (yet). So we
  need to use a BytesIO which gets the utf-8 string from the
  web-interface. Compatibility for old versions by using
  StringIO.StringIO for emulating a io.BytesIO also works.
  Thanks to Cedric Krier for reporting. Closes issue2550713.
  Added a regression test for EditCSVAction (Ralf)
- Fix issue2550691 where a Unix From-Header was sometimes inserted in
  outgoing emails, thanks to Joseph Myers for the patch. (Ralf)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.4 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.4+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
