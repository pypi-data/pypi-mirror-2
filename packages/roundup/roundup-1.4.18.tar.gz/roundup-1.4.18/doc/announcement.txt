This is the announcement of version 1.4.18 of Roundup, a Bug-Fix Release
for a critical bug in roundups mail gateway.
The bug will lead to files being unlinked from issues when mails without
attachment are received for an existing issue. See the "Software
Upgrade" guidelines in doc/announcement.txt (or the html version) for a
script you can run to find out potentially affected issues and how to
fix this. As usual some minor features and some bug fixes:

Features:

- Norwegian Bokmal translation by Christian Aastorp
- Allow to specify additional cc and bcc emails (not roundup users) for
  nosymessage used by the nosyreaction reactor. (Ralf)

Fixed:

- Fix file-unlink bug in mailgw (Ralfs oversight when refactoring the mail
  gateway code) -- if a message is sent that contains no attachments,
  all previous files of the issue are unlinked, thanks to Rafal
  Bisingier for reporting and proposing a fix.
  I've now added a regression test that catches this issue.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.4 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.4+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
