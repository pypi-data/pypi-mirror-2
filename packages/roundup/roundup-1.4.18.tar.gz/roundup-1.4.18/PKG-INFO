Description: This is the announcement of version 1.4.18 of Roundup, a Bug-Fix Release
        for a critical bug in roundups mail gateway.
        The bug will lead to files being unlinked from issues when mails without
        attachment are received for an existing issue. See the "Software
        Upgrade" guidelines in doc/announcement.txt (or the html version) for a
        script you can run to find out potentially affected issues and how to
        fix this. As usual some minor features and some bug fixes:
        
        Features:
        
        - Norwegian Bokmal translation by Christian Aastorp
        - Allow to specify additional cc and bcc emails (not roundup users) for
          nosymessage used by the nosyreaction reactor. (Ralf)
        
        Fixed:
        
        - Fix file-unlink bug in mailgw (Ralfs oversight when refactoring the mail
          gateway code) -- if a message is sent that contains no attachments,
          all previous files of the issue are unlinked, thanks to Rafal
          Bisingier for reporting and proposing a fix.
          I've now added a regression test that catches this issue.
        
        If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
        the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.
        
        Roundup requires python 2.4 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.

        About Roundup
        =============
        
        Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
        command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
        from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.
        
        Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
        project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.
        
        Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
        "description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:
        
        (a) submit new issues,
        (b) find and edit existing issues, and
        (c) discuss issues with other participants.
        
        The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
        discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
        the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
        is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.4+ (but not 3+)
        installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
        though an install script is provided.
        
        It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
        a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
        and postgresql).
