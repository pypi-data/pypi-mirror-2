I'm proud to release version 1.4.16 of Roundup which introduces some
minor features and, as usual, fixes some bugs:

Features:

- allow trackers to override the classes used to render properties in
  templating per issue2550659 (thanks Ezio Melotti)
- new mailgw configuration item "subject_updates_title": If set to "no"
  a changed subject in a reply to an issue will not update the issue
  title with the changed subject. Thanks to Arkadiusz Kita and Peter
  Funk for requesting the feature and discussing the implementation.
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bug-tracking.roundup.user/10169
- new rdbms config item sqlite_timeout makes the previously hard-coded
  timeout of 30 seconds configurable. This is the time a client waits
  for the locked database to become free before giving up. Used only for
  SQLite backend.
- new mailgw config item unpack_rfc822 that unpacks message attachments
  of type message/rfc822 and attaches the individual parts instead of
  attaching the whole message/rfc822 attachment to the roundup issue.

Fixed:

- fixed reporting of source missing warnings
- relevant tests made locale independent, issue2550660 (thanks
  Benni Bärmann for reporting).
- fix for incorrect except: syntax, issue2550661 (thanks Jakub Wilk)
- No longer use the root logger, use a logger with prefix "roundup",
  see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bug-tracking.roundup.devel/5356
- improve handling of '&gt;' when URLs are converted to links, issue2550664
  (thanks Ezio Melotti)
- fixed registration, issue2550665 (thanks Timo Paulssen)
- make sorting of multilinks in the web interface more robust, issue2550663
- Fix charset of first text-part of outgoing multipart messages, thanks Dirk
  Geschke for reporting, see
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bug-tracking.roundup.user/10223
- Fix handling of incoming message/rfc822 attachments. These resulted in
  a weird mail usage error because the email module threw a TypeError
  which roundup interprets as a Reject exception. Fixes issue2550667.
  Added regression tests for message/rfc822 attachments with and without
  configured unpacking (mailgw unpack_rfc822, see Features above)
  Thanks to Benni Bärmann for reporting.
- Allow search_popup macro to work with all db classes, issue2550567
  (thanks John Kristensen)
- lower memory footprint for (journal-) import

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.3 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.3+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
