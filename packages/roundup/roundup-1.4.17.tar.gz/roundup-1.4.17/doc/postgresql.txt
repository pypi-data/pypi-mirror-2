PostgreSQL/psycopg Backend
==========================

This are notes about PostqreSQL backend based on the psycopg adapter for
Roundup issue tracker.

Prerequisites
=============

To use PostgreSQL as backend for storing roundup data, you should
additionally install:

1. PostgreSQL 7.x - http://www.postgresql.org/

2. The psycopg python interface to PostgreSQL:

     http://initd.org/software/initd/psycopg

   It is recommended that you use at least version 1.1.21

Some advice on setting up the postgresql backend may be found at:

Running the PostgreSQL unit tests
=================================

The user that you're running the tests as will need to be able to access
the postgresql database on the local machine and create and drop
databases. Edit the ``test/test_postgresql.py`` database connection info if
you wish to test against a different database.

The test database will be called "rounduptest".
