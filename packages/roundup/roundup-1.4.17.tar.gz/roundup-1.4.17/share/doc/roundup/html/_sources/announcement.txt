I'm proud to release version 1.4.17 of Roundup which introduces some
minor features and, as usual, fixes some bugs:

Features:

- Allow declaration of default_values for properties in schema.
- Add explicit "Search" permissions, see Security Fix below.
- Add "lookup" method to xmlrpc interface (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Multilinks can be filtered by combining elements with AND, OR and NOT
  operators now. A javascript gui was added for "keywords", see issue2550648.
  Developed by Sascha Teichmann; funded by Intevation. (Bernhard Reiter)
- Factor MailGW message parsing into a separate class, thanks to John
  Kristensen who did the major work in issue2550576 -- I wouldn't
  have attempted it without this. Fixes issue2550576. (Ralf)
- Now if the -C option to roundup-mailgw specifies "issue" this refers
  to an issue-like class. The real class is determined from the
  configured default class, or the -c option to the mailgw, or the class
  resulting from mail subject parsing. We also accept multiple -S
  options for the same class now. (Ralf)
- Optimisation: Late evaluation of Multilinks (only in rdbms backends):
  previously we materialized each multilink in a Node -- this creates an
  SQL query for each multilink (e.g. 'files' and 'messages' for each
  line in the issue index display) -- even if the multilinks aren't
  displayed. Now we compute multilinks only if they're accessed (and
  keep them cached).
- Add a filter_iter similar to the existing filter call. This feature is
  considered experimental. This is currently not used in the
  web-interface but passes all tests for the filter call except sorting
  by Multilinks (which isn't supported by SQL and isn't a sane concept
  anyway). When using filter_iter instead of filter this saves a *lot*
  of SQL queries: Filter returns only the IDs of Nodes in the database,
  the additional content of a Node has to be fetched in a separate SQL
  call. The new filter_iter also returns the IDs of Nodes (one by one,
  it's an iterator) but pre-seeds the cache with the content of the
  Node. The information needed for seeding the cache is retrieved in the
  same SQL query as the ids.

Fixed:

- Security Fix: Add a check for search-permissions: now we allow
  searching for properties only if the property is readable without a
  check method or if an explicit search permission (see above unter
  "Features) is given for the property. This fixes cases where a user
  doesn't have access to a property but can deduce the content by
  crafting a clever search, group or sort query.
  see doc/upgrading.txt for how to fix your trackers! (Ralf Schlatterbeck).
- Range support in roundup-server so large files can be served, 
  e.g. media files on iOS/iPads; issue2550694. (Bernhard Reiter; 
  Thanks to Jon C. Thomason for the patch.)
- Fix search for xapian 1.2 issue2550676 
  (Bernhard Reiter; Thanks to Olly Betts for providing the patch.)
- Some minor typos fixed in doc/customizing.txt (Thanks Ralf Hemmecke).
- XML-RPC documentation now linked from the docs/index (Bernhard Reiter).
- Fix setting of sys.path when importing schema.py, fixes issue2550675,
  thanks to Bryce L Nordgren for reporting. (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- clear the cache on commit for rdbms backends: Don't carry over cached
  values from one transaction to the next (there may be other changes
  from other transactions) see new ConcurrentDBTest for a
  read-modify-update cycle that fails with the old caching behavior.
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Fix incorrect setting of template in customizing.txt example action,
  patch via issue2550682 (thanks John Kristensen)
- Configuration issue: On some postgresql 8.4 installations (notably on
  debian squeeze) the default template database used for database
  creation doesn't match the needed character encoding UTF8 -- a new
  config option 'template' in the rdbms section now allows specification
  of the template. You know you need this option if you get the error
  message:
  psycopg2.DataError: new encoding (UTF8) is incompatible with the
  encoding of the template database (SQL_ASCII)
  HINT:  Use the same encoding as in the template database, or use
  template0 as template.
  (Ralf Schlatterbeck)
- Fixed bug in mailgw refactoring, patch issue2550697 (thanks Hubert
  Touvet)
- Fix Password handling security issue2550688 (thanks Joseph Myers for
  reporting and Eli Collins for fixing) -- this fixes all observations
  by Joseph Myers except for auto-migration of existing passwords.
- Add new config-option 'migrate_passwords' in section 'web' to
  auto-migrate passwords at web-login time. Default for the new option
  is "yes" so if you don't want that passwords are auto-migrated to a
  more secure password scheme on user login, set this to "no" before
  running your tracker(s) after the upgrade.
- Add new config-option 'password_pbkdf2_default_rounds' in 'main'
  section to configure the default parameter for new password
  generation. Set this to a higher value on faster systems which want
  more security. Thanks to Eli Collins for implementing this (see
  issue2550688).
- Fix documentation for roundup-server about the 'host' parameter as
  suggested in issue2550693, fixes the first part of this issue. Make
  'localhost' the new default for this parameter, note the upgrading
  documentation of changed behaviour.  We also deprecate the empty host
  parameter for binding to all interfaces now (still left in for
  compatibility). Thanks to Toni Mueller for providing the first version
  of this patch and discussing implementations.
- Fixed bug in filter_iter refactoring (lazy multilinks), in rare cases
  this would result in duplicate multilinks to the same node. We're now
  going the safe route and doing lazy evaluation only for read-only
  access, whenever updates are done we fetch everything.

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation.

Roundup requires python 2.4 or later (but not 3+) for correct operation.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this
project is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.4+ (but not 3+)
installation. It doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational,
though an install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and four database back-ends (anydbm, sqlite, mysql
and postgresql).
