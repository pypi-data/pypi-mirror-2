Description: 
        Help module to parse a simple XML buffer and store it as a read-only (mostly)
        dictionary type object (MyXml). This dictionary can hold other dictionaries,
        nodes-lists, or leaf nodes. Access to the nodes by using attributes.
        
        >>> xml = parse("<Foo><Bar>Val</Bar></Foo>")
        >>> xml.Foo.Bar == "Val"
        True
        
        I don't like to use the built in Python DOM parsers for simple XML data, but
        this module is good only for simple XML! No name-spaces, CDATA and other fancy
        features are supported.
        
        There are three factory functions, "parse", "parse_file" and "parse_object".
        
        - parse takes an XML string and builds MyXml object from it.
        
        - parse_file takes a file name reads it and do the same.
        
        - parse_object takes a complex python object (of dictionaries, sequences and
        scalars) and creates MyXml object from it.
        
        It is possible, but not convenient, to construct an XML trees using this module.
        
        see my_xml built in documentation for usage examples.
