        :synopsis: Provides a layer to abstract the Python developer from the graph database system used
        
        Following the set of interfaces provided by tinkerpop for Blueprints,
        this proyect aims to give Python developers a similar functionality.
        A set of abstract classes are defined in order to guide the design of
        implementations for the different graph database engines.
