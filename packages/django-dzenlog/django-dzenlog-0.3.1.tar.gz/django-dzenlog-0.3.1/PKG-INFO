Description: 
        Django Dzenlog is a set of models and templates, which can be
        used to create blogs with different kinds media.
        
        Dzenlog relies on new django's feature -- model inheritance,
        so you can derive you own models from dzenlog's models and
        add an actual information.
        
        This is very effective way of the code reuse, because dzenlog
        will take care about all publishing options, and all what you
        need is to describe details, specific to you particular blog.
        
        For example, for can create a blog with two post types: textual
        posts and links to internet resources. In that case, all you need
        is to define two models: `TextPost` and `LinkPost`. Each of these
        models should be derived from `django_dzenlog.models.GeneralPost`.
