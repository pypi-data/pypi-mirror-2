Amazon Machine Instance (AMI)
=============================

To provide a static environment for testing and running *edittag* and to enable users to easily run *edittag* on a multicore machine, we provide an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) with all dependencies installed that is particularly useful when generating large (â‰¥ 8 base pair) edit metric tag sets.  We maintain this AMI, to which we have installed several other packages that may be useful (more info)::
