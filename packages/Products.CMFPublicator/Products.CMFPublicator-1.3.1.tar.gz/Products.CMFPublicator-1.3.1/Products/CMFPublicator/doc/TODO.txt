CMFPublicator TODO

 * Search based on Topics engine

 * Option to enable syncronous extraction of items data

 * Improve portlet examples and add more examples

 * Improve install uninstall script, it's working fine but it's so ugly :)

 * Generate RSS

 * Support for LinguaPlone getting all translations of the object title and
   use it in the edit interface.

 * Distinguished roles and/or groups that can edit/manage each box

 * Capability to catch and select RSS items in the publication boxes

 * Mechanism like Archetypes InAndOutWidget for moving items from one list
   to another. Items are removed from the first list. (more easy publication)

 * Tests?

 * More translations, yes, we need your help! ;-)
