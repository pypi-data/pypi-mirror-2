    * Added ellipsis and use_topics properties and added a form to manipulate
      these properties.

    * Implemented interfaces to publicator tool

    * Renamed Script Python getItemInfo to getPublicatorItemInfo because it
      had a simple name and may conflict with another method

      item selected
