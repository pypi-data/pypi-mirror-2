Description: Summary
        -------
        
        The `comment` cube provides threadable comments feature.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This cube creates a new entity type called `Comment` which could basically be
        read by every body but only added by application's users.
        It also defines a relation `comments` which provides the ability to add a
        `Comment` which `comments` a `Comment`.
        
        To use this cube, you want to add the relation `comments` on the entity type
        you want to be able to comment. For instance, let's say your cube defines a
        schema for a blog. You want all the blog entries to be commentable.
        Here is how to define it in your schema:
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
        from yams.buildobjs import RelationDefinition
        class comments(RelationDefinition):
        subject = 'Comment'
        object = 'BlogEntry'
        cardinality = '1*'
        
        Once this relation is defined, you can post comments and view threadable
        comments automatically on blog entry's primary view.
