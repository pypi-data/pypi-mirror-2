        ===============
        
        This package provides Zope2 integration of zope.fssync/zope.app.fssync, that
        is, the ability to dump and restore ZODB content to the filesystem (To that
        end, it provides synchronisers for OFS folders and the like, and adapts the
        Zope3-ish mechanisms of zope.app.fssync to work with the Zope2 publisher).
        
        Its main use case is to keep code stored inside the ZODB in a source code
        management system. Therefore, it tries to make the pickles that are written to
        disk as readable as possible (e. g. by not using base64 encoding).
        
        So far, it concentrates on the ``dump`` and ``load`` actions (which
        overwrite their target completely), since merging changes between different
        checkouts needs to be done via the SCM anyway. (zope.app.fssync offers several
        other actions, such as ``update`` and ``commit``, that try to be smart when
        both the ZODB and the filesystem dump have changed concurrently. While this is
        fine as long as only one filesystem representation exists, the model breaks
        down when several dumps need to be synchronized with each other -- it is highly
        non-trivial to determine whose change really is the right one in that case, so
        we recommend against using these actions at this point.)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You'll need to load both the configure.zcml and overrides.zcml configuration
        files.
        
        gocept.fssyncz2 provides a console script called ``fssync`` which wraps the two
        actions (``dump`` and ``load``) and allows to pass in all other
        parameters (URLs, locations, credentials). This is meant to be generated (via
        buildout for example), like this::
        
        [fssync]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts
        eggs = gocept.fssyncz2
        extra-paths = ${zope2:location}/lib/python
        arguments = host='${instance:http-address}', folder='myfolder', credentials='${instance:user}', repository='${buildout:directory}/var/zodb-dump'
        
        Then you can dump your ZODB to the configured filesystem location with
        ``bin/fssync dump`` and load the data stored on the filesystem into the
        ZODB with ``bin/fssync load``.

        Changes
        =======
        
        
        1.2 (2011-04-10)
        ================
        
        - make sure that newlines inside strings end up as newlines instead of \n
        notation in XML pickles (fixes #8860)
        
        - install the fssync script in the development buildout
        
        - when dumping a PythonScript, leave out its _code attribute to reduce noise
        in the XML pickles (fixes #8859)
        
        - declared dependency on zope.i18nmessageid
        
        - better error message when finding persistent objects in Extras
        
        
        1.1 (2011-01-31)
        ================
        
        - Renamed console commands to dump/load instead of checkout/checkin to avoid
        confusion with SCM operations.
        
        
        1.0 (2011-01-31)
        ================
