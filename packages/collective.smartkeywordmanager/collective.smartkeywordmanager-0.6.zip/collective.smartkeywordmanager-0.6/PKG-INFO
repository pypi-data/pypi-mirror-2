Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Smart  Keyword Manager is  a Plone  product making  it easy  to manage
        keywords ("tags") using smart folders.  On any smart folder, a new tab
        will appear for Managers, allowing  them to do either batch edition of
        keywords, or massive addition/removal  on all objects displayed by the
        smart folder.
        
        This product is based on SmartKwManager
