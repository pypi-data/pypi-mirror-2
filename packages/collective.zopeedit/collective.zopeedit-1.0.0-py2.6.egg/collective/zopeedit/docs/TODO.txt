ZopeEdit - ToDo !
=================

Short term improvements
-----------------------

    - When there is an error using a proxy, try without proxy

Long term improvements
----------------------

    - when there is a network issue and the user can't save the file back : 

        - save the file in the user's folder, (use a dedicated ZopeEdit-offline folder ?)
        - when we launch zopeedit manually, reopen these files as if they were just opened, re-starting the monitor process
        - therefore these files will be saved back and unlocked


Ideas ...
---------

    - a monitoring panel showing the status of _all_ files opened with ZopeEdit
    - notification messages
    - plugins for server specific context :
        - default is Zope standalone, with limited functions
        - olther content management plugins
