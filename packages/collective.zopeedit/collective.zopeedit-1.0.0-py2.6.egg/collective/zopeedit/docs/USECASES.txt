Usecases handled by ZopeEdit
============================

Introduction
------------

ZopeEdit can handle many proxy and server configurations. It can work in many
cases, but their can be usecases not handled.

This file explains how each usecase is handled.

Configuration file and proxy
----------------------------

    The configuration file is edited by the user by launching zopeedit directly
    either in command line or application launcher.
    
    The config file is used prior to any other possibility when an option is
    defined.
    
    The config file has options for proxy definition, configuration and
    authentification.
    
    When their is no option defined in the configuration file, zopeedit will
    try to auto-detect the user's environment configuration. If a proxy is
    defined at the system level, zopeedit will try to use it. This is called
    "auto-proxy".
    

Situations
----------

    - http / auto proxy
    
        * this needs more testing
        * maybe issue in the code : how does it use the proxy ?
        * what happens when the auto-detected proxy fails to connect
          the server ?
    
    
    - https / auto proxy
        
        * what happens when the auto-detected proxy fails to connect
          the server ?
    
    - http / manual proxy
