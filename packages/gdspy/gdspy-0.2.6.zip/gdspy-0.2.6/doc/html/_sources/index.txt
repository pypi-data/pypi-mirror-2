GDSII for Python
================

**gdspy** is a Python  module for creating GDSII stream files, usually
CAD layouts. 

It includes a layout viewer for the geometries created.  Note that
**gdspy** does not load GDSII files, only creates them.


Requirements
------------

* `Python 2.* <http://www.python.org>`_
* `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
* `PIL (Python Imaging Library)
  <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ -- (optional) for direct
  output of the layout to an image file


Download and Install
--------------------

There are 2 options for downloading and installing **gdspy**.

These instructions assume you have the required software already
installed, and that your Python installation and scripts folders are on
your system path (usually ``C:\Python2*`` and ``C:\Python2*\Scripts`` on
Windows).

On Linux and Mac OS these folders are usually automatically added to the
path.


Option 1
^^^^^^^^

If you have `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
installed, just use::

   easy_install -U gdspy


Option 2
^^^^^^^^

Download the source files from `gdspy at Sourceforge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdspy/>`_ and extract it to any folder.

Execute the following command in a terminal window from within the
extracted folder::

   python setup.py install

.. note::

   Linux and Mac OS user may need to use ``sudo`` in front of these
   commands.

History of Changes
------------------

**Version 0.2.6 (February 28, 2011)**

* When saving a GDSII file, ``ValueError`` is raised if cell names are
  duplicated.

* Save screenshot from ``LayoutViewer``.

* ``gds_image`` accepts ``cells``, instead of ``lists``.

* Outlines supported by ``gds_image``.

* ``LayoutViewer`` stores bounding box information for all visited layers to
  save rendering time.

**Version 0.2.5 (December 10, 2010)**

* Empty cells no longer break the LayoutViewer.

* Removed the ``gds_view`` function, superseded by the LayoutViewer,
  along with all dependencies to matplotlib.

* Fixed a bug in ``boolean`` which affected polygons with series of
  collinear vertices.

* Added a function to ``slice`` polygons along straight lines parallel
  to an axis.

**Version 0.2.4 (September 04, 2010)**

* Added shortcut to Extents in LayoutViewer: ``Home`` or ``a`` keys.

* ``PolygonSet`` is the new base class for ``Round``, which might bring
  some incompatibility issues with older scripts.

* ``Round`` elements, ``PolyPath``, ``L1Path``, and ``Path arc``,
  ``turn`` and ``parametric`` sections are now automatically fractured
  into pieces defined by a maximal number of points.

* Default value for ``max_points`` in boolean changed to 199.

* Removed the flag to disable the warning about polygons with more than
  199 vertices.  The warning is shown only for ``Polygon`` and
  ``PolygonSet``.

* Fixed a bug impeding parallel ``parametric`` paths to change their
  distance to each other.

**Version 0.2.3 (August 09, 2010)**

* Added the ``PolyPath`` class to easily create paths with sharp
  corners.

* Allow ``None`` as item in the colors parameter of ``LayoutViewer`` to
  make layers invisible.

* Added color outline mode to ``LayoutViewer`` (change outline color
  with the shift key pressed)

* Increased the scroll region of the ``LayoutViewer`` canvas

* Added a fast scroll mode: control + drag 2nd mouse button

* Created a new sample script

**Version 0.2.2 (July 29, 2010)**

* Changed the cursor inside ``LayoutViewer`` to standard arrow.

* Fixed bugs with the windows version of ``LayoutViewer`` (mouse wheel
  and ruler tool).

**Version 0.2.1 (July 29, 2010)**

* Bug fix: ``gds_image`` displays an error message instead of crashing
  when ``PIL`` is not found.

* Added class ``LayoutViewer``, which uses Tkinter (included in all
  python distributions) to display the GDSII layout with better controls
  then the gds_view function. This eliminates the ``matplotlib``
  requirement for the viewer functionality.

* New layer colors extending layers 0 to 63.

**Version 0.2.0 (July 19, 2010)**

* Fixed a bug on the ``turn`` method of ``Path``.

* Fixed a bug on the ``boolean`` function that would give an error when
  not using ``Polygon`` or ``PolygonSet`` as input objects.

* Added the method ``get_polygons`` to ``Cell``, ``CellReference`` and
  ``CellArray``.

* Added a copy method to ``Cell``.

* Added a ``flatten`` method to ``Cell`` to remove references (or array
  references) to other cells.

* Fracture ``boolean`` output polygons based on the number of vertices
  to respect the 199 GDSII limit.
                                       
**Version 0.1.9 (June 04, 2010)**

* Added ``L1Path`` class for Manhattan geometry (L1 norm) paths.

**Version 0.1.8 (May 10, 2010)**

* Removed the argument ``fill`` from ``gds_view`` and added a more
  flexible one: ``style``.

* Fixed a rounding error on the ``boolean`` operator affecting polygons
  with holes.

* Added a rotate method to ``PolygonSet``.

* Added a warning when ``PolygonSet`` has more than 199 points

* Added a flag to disable the warning about polygons with more than
  199 points.

* Added a ``turn`` method to ``Path``, which is easier to use than
  ``arc``.

* Added a direction attribute to ``Path`` to keep the information used
  by the ``segment`` and ``turn`` methods.

**Version 0.1.7 (April 12, 2010)**

* New visualization option: save the geometry directly to an image file
  (lower memory use).

* New functionality added: boolean operations on polygons (polygon
  clipping).

* All classes were adapted to work with the boolean operations.

* The attribute size in the initializer of class ``Text`` does not have
  a default value any longer.

* The name of the argument ``format`` in the function ``gds_view`` was
  changed to ``fill`` (to avoid confusion with the built-in function
  ``format``).

**Version 0.1.6 (December 15,  2009)**

* Sample script now include comments and creates an easier to understand
  GDSII example.

* Improved floating point to integer rounding, which fixes the unit
  errors at the last digit of the precision in the GDSII file.

* Fixed the font for character 5.

* Added a flag to gds_view to avoid the automatic call to
  ``matplotlib.pyplot.show()``.

* In ``gds_view``, if a layer number is greater than the number of
  formats defined, the formats are cycled.

**Version 0.1.5a (November 15, 2009)**

* Class Text correctly interprets ``\n`` and ``\t`` characters.

* Better documentation format, using the Sphinx engine and the numpy
  format.

**Version 0.1.4 (October 5, 2009)**

* Class ``Text`` re-written with a different font with no overlaps and
  correct size.

**Version 0.1.3a (July 29 2009)**

* Fixed the function ``to_gds`` of class ``Rectangle``.

**Version 0.1.3 (July 27, 2009)**

* Added the datatype field to all elements of the GDSII structure.

**Version 0.1.2 (July 11, 2009)**

* Added the ``gds_view`` function to display the GDSII structure using
  the matplotlib module.

* Fixed a rotation bug in the CellArray class.

* Module published under the GNU General Public License (GPL)

**Version 0.1.1 (May 12, 2009)**

* Added attribute cell_list to class Cell to hold a list of all Cell
  created.

* Set the default argument ``cells=Cell.cell_list`` in the function
  ``gds_print``.

* Added member to calculate the area for each element type.

* Added member to calculate the total area of a Cell or the area by
  layer.

* Included the possibility of creating objects in user-defined units,
  not only nanometers.

**Version 0.1.0 (May 1, 2009)**

* Initial release.
