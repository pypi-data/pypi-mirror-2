Changelog
=========

1.0b5 - 2010-04-19
------------------

* Added support for zope.schema.Decimal fields.
  [optilude]

1.0b4 - 2009-11-17
------------------

* Ignored vocabularyName property when writing Choice fields. The constructor
  still uses they 'vocabulary' key in an overloaded capacity. We only support
  'vocabulary' with a named vocabulary, or 'values' with a list of values.
  This fixes test failures on Zope 2.12 / zope.schema 3.5.4.
  [optilude]

1.0b3 - 2009-09-28
------------------

* Add support for synchronising marker interfaces found on source fields
  to syncSchema().
  [optilude]

1.0b2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/
  
  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. load_file() becomes
  loadFile().
  [optilude]

* No longer include name kwarg to Field constructor if no name was set
