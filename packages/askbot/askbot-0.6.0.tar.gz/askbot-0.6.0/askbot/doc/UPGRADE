if you are upgrading this software, then

* first download the newer version and write it over the old one.

for the database migrations you will need to use django package called "south"

Install it (if you don't have it yet) with:

    easy_install South

* 'south' must already be in the list of INSTALLED_APPS
  otherwise you must have downloaded wrong version of Askbot

if you are using south the very first time, then type:

    python manage.py migrate forum 0001_initial --fake

otherwise skip above step.

Finally run

    python manage.py migrate forum --auto

then all relevant schema and data migrations will be applied
