About this project
******************

This project is yet another attempt at making model translations suck less in
Django.

Features
--------

* Simple API 
* Predictable
* Reliable
* Fast (few and simple queries)
* High level (no custom SQL Compiler or other scary things)


Important
---------

We keep the nani name internally in the code, as we want to be able to adapt and contribute to/from django-nani
