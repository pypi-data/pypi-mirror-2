        =====
        
        Smewt is a smart media manager.
        
        It goes looking for your media files (movies, series, ...) and automatically
        recognizes them and gets more information on them from the web. It presents
        your collection not as a list of files, but as semantically related information,
        all of this in a slick interface.
