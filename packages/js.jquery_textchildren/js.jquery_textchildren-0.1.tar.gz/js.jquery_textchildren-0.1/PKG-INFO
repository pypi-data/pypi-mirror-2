        **********************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery Text Children`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery Text Children`: http://http://plugins.learningjquery.com/textchildren
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_textchildren``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``textchildren`` from ``js.jquery_textchildren`` and ``need``
        it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_textchildren import textchildren
          >>> textchildren.need()
