Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery Text Children`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery Text Children`: http://http://plugins.learningjquery.com/textchildren

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_textchildren``) are published to some URL.
