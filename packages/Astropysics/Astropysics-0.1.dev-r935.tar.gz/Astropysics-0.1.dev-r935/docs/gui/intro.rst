GUI applications
================

Astropysics includes a variety of graphical applications for various data analysis tasks.  
Their full power is acheived when used interactively or as part of scripts, but some 
operate as stand-alone command-line tools when the situation warrants.

Note that these applications make heavy use of `Enthought Traits <http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/>`_ and the associated `Enthought Tools Suite <http://code.enthought.com/projects/index.php>`_ 
 if they are not installed, most of these will not function.

the :mod:`gui` module also imports the convinience functions and primary application classes for these GUIs.  These include:

* :class:`FitGui <astropysics.gui.fitgui.FitGui>`
* :func:`fit_data <astropysics.gui.fitgui.fit_data>`
* :class:`Spylot <astropysics.gui.spylot.Spylot>`
* :func:`spylot_specs <astropysics.gui.spylot.spylot_specs>`
* :class:`SpecTarget <astropysics.gui.spectarget.SpecTarget>`
* :func:`spec_target <astropysics.gui.spectarget.spec_target>`
