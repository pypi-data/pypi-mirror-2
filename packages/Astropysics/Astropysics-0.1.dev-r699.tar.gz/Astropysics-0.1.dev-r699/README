Installation
------------

If you have numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) and scipy (http://www.scipy.org/) installed, just do

python setup.py install

On some linux distributions, this may need to be 

sudo python setup.py install

Documentation
-------------

Documentation (in the "docs" directory) is meant to be used with sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).  Typical usage is

python setup.py build_sphinx

to build html documentation and place it in docs/_build/html.  Note that this requires Sphinx 1.0 (in beta as of this writing)
