        WatchVideo is an application to watch videos from many popular Flash
        based sites using an external player like VLC.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        .. note::
        
           You can use the command ``make check-dependencies`` to see which
           dependencies are missing.
        
        For both GUI and CLI interface:
        
        * Python 2.5/2.6/2.7 (tested with Python 2.6 and 2.7)
        * GetMediumURL 0.0a2 or later
        * ``simplejson`` if using Python 2.5 (``python-simplejson``)
        
        The installation script will automatically install GetMediumURL if it
        is not available.  It requires ``lxml`` which should be installed from
        distribution package before (in Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions
        it is named ``python-lxml``).
        
        For GUI only:
        
        * PyQt4 (``python-qt4``) or PySide
        * libVLC version 1.1 (optional, required for built-in player)
        * ``python-notify`` (optional) – uses the system’s default mechanism to
          show notification messages
        * FFmpeg (optional) – needed for all operations related with video
          conversion, ripping or the built-in player.
        * FFmpeg2theora (optional) – needed to convert videos to Ogg Vorbis or
          Theora, but not for ripping audio
        
        For installation:
        
        * Distribute (``python-setuptools``)
        
        If you downloaded through Subversion:
        
        * ``pyqt4-dev-tools`` (``pylupdate4``, ``pyrcc4``, ``pyuic4``)
        * ``libqt4-dev`` (``lrelease``)
        * Inkscape
        * OptiPNG (optional)
        
        PyQt4 is used by default.  When it is not found, PySide is used but
        there are known bugs when using it.  Set the environment variable
        ``WATCHVIDEO_QT`` to a space-separated sequence of package names tried to
        use a different package (e.g. ``WATCHVIDEO_QT=PySide`` to use PySide on
        systems where PyQt4 is installed).
        
        
        Installation using ``easy_install``
        ===================================
        
        Use ``easy_install -U WatchVideo`` to install the newest release of
        WatchVideo.  Optional dependencies should be installed separately.
        
        Installation from source
        ========================
        
        Open terminal in the directory with this file and type ``sudo make install``.
        
        These options (specified after ``make``) can be used to change the
        installation directory:
        
          ``prefix``
            default is ``/usr/local``
          ``datarootdir``
            default is ``$prefix/share``
        
        Unless the prefix is changed, root priviledges are needed for
        installation.
        
        To use different Python interpreter than the one found by the ``python``
        command, specify it as the ``PYTHON`` variable.
        
        You can instead call ``python setup.py install`` with options described
        by ``python setup.py --help install`` and optionally install menu entry
        and icon by ``make install-data``.
        
        Using
        =====
        
        If installed
        ------------
        
        There should be an entry in your menu under the Audio and Video section.
        
        If not or if you prefer, you can call the app with the command::
        
          qtwatchvideo URL1 URL2 ...
        
        or simply::
        
          qtwatchvideo
        
        If you want to use the CLI version::
        
          watchvideo [OPTIONS] URL1 URL2 ...
        
        Run ``watchvideo --help`` to see all options of the CLI version.
        
        If not installed
        ----------------
        
        .. note::
        
           If you downloaded through Subversion, first you need to do ``make``
           to generate the necessary files.
        
        Running ``python setup.py develop --user`` with put scripts needed to
        run WatchVideo in ``$HOME/.local/bin``, and use other file from the
        directory where the source is located.  You might use the programs as
        ``~/.local/bin/qtwatchvideo`` and similarly ``watchvideo``, or write
        
        ::
        
          export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
        
        before to use them like when installed.
        
        Updating plugins
        ================
        
        WatchVideo uses a package called GetMediumURL to get the information
        from the video-sharing websites.  Some of these sites often change
        their interfaces, so it won't find the video.  In this case try to
        update GetMediumURL, by doing the following in a terminal:
        ``easy_install -U GetMediumURL`` or using your distribution packages for
        it.
        
        Translating
        ===========
        
        If you wish to translate this application, do the following:
        
        1. Open a terminal in the source distribution directory.
        2. Do ``make check-dependencies`` to see if you have the necessary
           dependencies.
        3. Add a reference for your language to ``L10N`` in the Makefile.
        4. Do ``make`` to generate the necessary files.
        5. Translate the ``.ts`` file generated in the ``po``
           subdirectory. You can use Qt Linguist or any text editor of your
           choice.
        6. When you're ready to test your translation, do ``make`` again.
