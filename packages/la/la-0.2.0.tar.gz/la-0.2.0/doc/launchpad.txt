Label the rows, columns, any dimension, of your NumPy arrays.

The main class of the la package is a labeled array, larry. A larry consists
of a data array and a label list. The data array is stored as a NumPy array
and the label list as a list of lists.

Alignment by label is automatic when you add (or subtract, multiply, divide)
two larrys.
    
larry has built-in methods such as movingsum, ranking, merge, shuffle,
zscore, demean, lag as well as typical Numpy methods like sum, max, std,
sign, clip. NaNs are treated as missing data.
 
You can archive larrys in HDF5 format using save and load or using a
dictionary-like interface.
    
larry adds the convenience of labels, provides many built-in methods, and
let's you use many of your existing NumPy array functions.

Note: There's nothing to compile; la is pure Python.
