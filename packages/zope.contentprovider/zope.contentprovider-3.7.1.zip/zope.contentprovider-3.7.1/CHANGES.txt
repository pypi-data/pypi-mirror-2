3.7.1 (2010-04-30)
------------------

- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from zope.testing.

3.7 (2010-04-27)
----------------

- Since tales:expressiontype is now in ``zope.browserpage``, update
  conditional ZCML accordingly so it doesn't depend on the presence of
  ``zope.app.pagetemplate`` anymore.

3.6.1 (2009-12-23)
------------------

- Ensure that our configure.zcml can be loaded without requiring further
  dependencies. It uses a ``tales:expressiontype`` directive defined in
  zope.app.pagetemplate. We keep that dependency optional, as not all consumers
  of this package use ZCML to configure the expression type.

3.6.0 (2009-12-22)
------------------

- Updated test dependency to use zope.browserpage.

3.5.0 (2009-03-18)
------------------

- Add very simple, but useful base class for implementing content
  providers, see ``zope.contentprovider.provider.ContentProviderBase``.

- Remove unneeded testing dependencies. We only need zope.testing and
  zope.app.pagetemplate.

- Remove zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.

- Added setuptools dependency to setup.py.

- Clean up package's description and documentation a bit. Remove
  duplicate text in README.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of
  retired one.

- Change ``cheeseshop`` to ``pypi`` in the package url.

3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
