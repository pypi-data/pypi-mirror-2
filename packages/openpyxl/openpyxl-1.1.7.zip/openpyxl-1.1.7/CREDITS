This software is *heavily* inspired by the PHPExcel library that can be found
here: http://www.phpexcel.net/

Kudos goes to the PHPExcel team, I'm only standing on their shoulders.

I'd also like to greatly thank all those who participate in the project: 

* Stephane Bard
* Yaroslav Halchenko
* Marko Loparic 
* Jonathan Peirce
* Philip Roche
