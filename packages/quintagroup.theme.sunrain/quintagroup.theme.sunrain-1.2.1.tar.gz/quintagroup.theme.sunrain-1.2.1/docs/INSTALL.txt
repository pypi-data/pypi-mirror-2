SunRain Plone Theme Installation
================================

To install quintagroup.plonecomments into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the ``/path/to/instance/lib/python`` directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.theme.sunrain-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="quintagroup.theme.sunrain"/>

* Restart the Zope server, for example, with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.theme.sunrain`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.theme.sunrain

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.theme.sunrain

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Restart the Zope server, for example, with the following command in the terminal::

    $ ./bin/instance restart

Then install SunRain Theme in Plone with Quickinstaller (Site Setup -> Add-on Products)
