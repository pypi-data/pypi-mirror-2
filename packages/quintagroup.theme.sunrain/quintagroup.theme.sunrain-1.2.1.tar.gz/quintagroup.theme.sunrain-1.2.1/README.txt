* SunRain Theme uses customizable slogan. To change portal slogan go to ZMI, open 'Properties' tab and type in your new slogan into 'description' field. Save changes.

* Logo. Default logotype dimensions - 188px width and 78px height. In case your logo height is bigger than the default one - portal-header area will be extended according to your logo height. So, to make theme header look appropriately - customize 'bg-header.jpg' image, i.e. replace it with an image of the same height as your logo. If your logo is smaller than the default one - it will be placed in the middle of logotype area.

* Search Box. New approach to site search display is implemented in this theme. In particular, searchSection is hidden during common page view. Simply hover the cursor to the search box area and the searchSection appears.
