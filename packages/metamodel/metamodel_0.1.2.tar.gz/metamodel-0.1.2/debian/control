Description: Unified Metamodel based model library 
 Model package for Python offering automatic serialization and 
 synchronization using different backends.
 .
 Models are to be defined based on one unified metamodel, and 
 they get a number of features for free, while keeping the model 
 access natural from the application, and data independent from 
 the application implementation.
