Description: 
        Finvoice is one of most commonly used XML dialects used for electronic
        invoicing in Finland.
        
        One of the major drawbacks of this format has been the lack of commonly
        available libraries for reading this format. This is exactly why Norfello
        developed an open source library for reading the format. With this library you
        can easily incorporate the receiving of Finvoice based messages to your
        software.
        
        FinvoiceLib consists of two main components: Reader and FinvoiceWrapper.
        The Reader component is the heart of the library as it encapsulates the full
        finvoice 1.2 message to a class based structure. This class structure can then
        be used access every single element found in the message. The second component,
        FinvoiceWrapper, wraps the most commonly used elements to a convinient helper
        class, that allows to access any of available elements with only a one single
        line of code!
