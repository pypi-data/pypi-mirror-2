FinvoiceLib v0.1
================

A library for reading Finvoice XML files.

Finvoice is one of most commonly used XML dialects used for electronic
invoicing in Finland.

One of the major drawbacks of this format has been the lack of
commonly available libraries for reading this format. This is exactly
why Norfello developed an open source library for reading the
format. With this library you can easily incorporate the receiving of
Finvoice based messages to your software.

FinvoiceLib consists of two main components: Reader and
FinvoiceWrapper. The Reader component is the heart of the library as
it encapsulates the full finvoice 1.2 message to a class based
structure. This class structure can then be used access every single
element found in the message. The second component, FinvoiceWrapper,
wraps the most commonly used elements to a convinient helper class,
that allows to access any of available elements with only a one single
line of code!
