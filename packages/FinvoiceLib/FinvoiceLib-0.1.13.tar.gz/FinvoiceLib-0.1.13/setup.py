      description="A library for reading Finvoice XML files",
      long_description="""
Finvoice is one of most commonly used XML dialects used for electronic
invoicing in Finland.

One of the major drawbacks of this format has been the lack of commonly
available libraries for reading this format. This is exactly why Norfello
developed an open source library for reading the format. With this library you
can easily incorporate the receiving of Finvoice based messages to your
software.

FinvoiceLib consists of two main components: Reader and FinvoiceWrapper.
The Reader component is the heart of the library as it encapsulates the full
finvoice 1.2 message to a class based structure. This class structure can then
be used access every single element found in the message. The second component,
FinvoiceWrapper, wraps the most commonly used elements to a convinient helper
class, that allows to access any of available elements with only a one single
line of code!
