The select_backport module is a backport of Christian Heimes' patch for
Python 2.6 to Python 2.4 and 2.5. It contains an interface to Linux's epoll()
and BSD's kqueue system calls. It is also kept up-to-date with Python svn.

>>> try:
...     import select_backport as select
... except ImportError:
...     import select
>>> ep = select.epoll()
