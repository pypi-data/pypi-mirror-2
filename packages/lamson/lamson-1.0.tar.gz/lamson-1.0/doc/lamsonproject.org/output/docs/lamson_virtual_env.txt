Title: Installing Lamson Into Virtualenv With Pip


The best way to install Lamson in a virtualenv is using the "pip
tool":http://pip.openplans.org/ to install it. This will automatically fetch
the code from bazaar, install it inside the virtualenv and fetch any missing
dependencies.

First, if you haven't already, you'll need to install pip. Make sure 
you've activated the virtualenv:

<pre class="code">
. bin/activate
</pre>

from the root of the virtualenv, and then run:

<pre class="code">
easy_install -U pip
</pre>

If you have bazaar installed on your machine, then just do:

<pre class="code">
pip install -e bzr+http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~zedshaw/lamson/development/#egg lamson
</pre>

This'll install the development version of lamson into a src/lamson 
directory (src/ will be created if it doesn't exist). It will also 
install all of Lamson's dependencies into the virtualenv. If you 
want to update to the latest development version of Lamson, run:

<pre class="code">
cd src/lamson
bzr pull
</pre>

This will fetch the latest bazaar tip from Launchpad.

If you don't have bazaar installed and don't want to install it, you 
can grab the latest release of Lamson like this:

<pre class="code">
pip install -F http://launchpad.net/lamson/trunk/0.9-pre2/+download/lamson-0.9-pre2.tar.gz
</pre>

Remember though that if you do install it like this you'll need to 
manually update it by visiting Launchpad, finding the latest tarball 
URL and `pip install`ing it.
