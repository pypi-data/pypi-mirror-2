PyPI SSH Access
---------------

For a long time, PyPI access required HTTP basic authentication with username and password.
Even though OpenID is supported as well today, this cannot work for use in the distutils
register and upload commands. In addition to these two methods, PyPI also supports
authentication with an SSH key.

To use this feature, upload your SSH key into the PyPI's 
`Your Details <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=user_form>`_ form. As distutils
currently doesn't support using such a connection, this package performs heavy
monkey-patching of distutils to make it use the system's ssh command. Users using
this package should run ssh-agent (which runs automatically in the background on
many systems) and load their PyPI key into the ssh agent.

This release requires an "ssh" binary in the path. It has been tested only on Mac OS X.

The source code and bug tracker for this package is available on 
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/loewis/pypissh>`_.
