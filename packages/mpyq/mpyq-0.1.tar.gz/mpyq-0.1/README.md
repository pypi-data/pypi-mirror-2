# mpyq

mpyq is a Python library for reading MPQ (MoPaQ) archives used in many of
Blizzard's games. It was originally developed for data mining Starcraft II
replay files.

In addition to being a library, mpyq also has a command line interface that
exposes some of the library's core functionality such as extracting archives.

At this early stage in development only files compressed with DEFLATE or bzip2
are uncompressed. This means that this library can not be used to extract most
big game asset archives that Blizzard's games use. More compression formats
will be supported in the future.

Also, as mpyq is so far pure Python code, it might be unfeasible to try to
extract very large MPQ archives, even if all the compression methods used
inside the archive were supported.

Note that listing files inside an archive does not require full extraction.
You can safely take a peek inside any MPQ archive with this library.

## Installation

mpyq can be installed with the included setup.py script.

    python setup.py install

Running this command will install mpyq both as a library and a stand-alone
script that can be run from anywhere, provided that you have added Python's
bin directory to your PATH environment variable.

Alternative way to install mpyq is to clone this git repository somewhere on
your filesystem and then either adjust your PYTHONPATH environment variable to
point to the directory that contains the repository or create a symbolic link
to your Python's site-packages directory pointing at the repository.

## Usage

### As a library

    >>> from mpyq import MPQArchive
    >>> archive = MPQArchive('game.SC2Replay')

Now you have a MPQArchive object of the file you opened. One common thing
to do now is to extract the files from the archive.

    >>> files = archive.extract()

This will extract and return the archive's contents in memory. Be advised
that you might not want to do this with multi-gigabyte MPQ files from
World of Warcraft, for example.

Files inside the archive can be also extracted and written to disk.

    >>> archive.extract_to_disk()

For more information, consult `help(mpyq)` in your Python console.

### From the command line

    usage: mpyq.py [-h] [-I] [-t] [-x] file

    mpyq reads and extracts MPQ archives.

    positional arguments:
      file              path to the archive

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -I, --headers     print header information from the archive
      -t, --list-files  list files inside the archive
      -x, --extract     extract files from the archive

You can extract all the files inside the archive with `-x/--extract`.

    ./mpyq.py -x game.SC2Replay

This will create a directory called 'game' with the files inside.

You can print the header information from a given archive with `-I/--headers`.

    ./mpyq.py -I game.SC2Replay
    MPQ archive header

    block_table_offset_high        0
    offset                         1024

    MPQ user data header
    --------------------
    magic                          'MPQ\x1b'
    user_data_size                 512
    mpq_header_offset              1024
    user_data_header_size          60
    content                        '\x05\x08\x00\x02,StarCraft II replay\x1b
                                    11\x02\x05\x0c\x00\t\x02\x02\t\x02\x04\t
                                    \x00\x06\t\x00\x08\t\xea\xfb\x01\n\t\xda

You can list all files inside the archive with `-t/--list-files`.

    ./mpyq.py -t game.SC2Replay

    replay.details                      451 bytes
