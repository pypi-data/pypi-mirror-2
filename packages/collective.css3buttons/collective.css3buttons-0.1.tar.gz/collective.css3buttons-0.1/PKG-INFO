Description: # CSS3 Buttons for Plone #
        
        This package brings in the functionality of [CSS3 buttons
        ](http://css3buttons.michaelhenriksen.dk) into [Zope](http://zope.org) /
        [Plone](http://plone.org/).
        
        
        ## Buildout Installation ##
        
        Add the egg and zcml references to your buildout.cfg:
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.css3buttons
        
        ...
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        collective.css3buttons
        ...
        
        
        ## Usage Instructions ##
        
        ### Enable the stylesheet ###
        
        If you are using this directly (i.e. within Zope and/or without Plone),
        you will need to include the css resource file like so:
        
        <style type="text/css">
        @import url(/++resource++collective.css3buttons.resources/stylesheets/css3buttons.css);
        </style>
        
        If this is used under Plone, just activate the product `CSS3 Buttons`
        under Site Setup > Add-ons.
        
        ### Add the classes ###
        
        Just insert the HTML fragments as defined in the [documentation
        ](http://css3buttons.michaelhenriksen.dk) for CSS3 Buttons into your
        template files.
