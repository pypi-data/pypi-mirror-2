"""The domain package is a data dictionary of quantities and units that define datatypes for attributes (properties) that may be used by any class in any other package.  This package contains the definition of primitive datatypes, including units of measure and permissible values. Each datatype contains a value attribute and an optional unit of measure, which is specified as a static variable initialized to the textual description of the unit of measure. The value of the 'units' string may be country or customer specific. Typical values are given. Permissible values for enumerations are listed in the documentation for the attribute using UML constraint syntax inside curly braces. Lengths of variable strings are listed in the descriptive text where required.
