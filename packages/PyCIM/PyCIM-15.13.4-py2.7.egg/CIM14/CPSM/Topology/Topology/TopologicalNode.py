Topological nodes changes as the current network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change state). For a planning model switch statuses are not used to form TopologicalNodes. Instead they are manually created or deleted in a model builder tool. TopologialNodes maintained this way are also called 'busses'.
