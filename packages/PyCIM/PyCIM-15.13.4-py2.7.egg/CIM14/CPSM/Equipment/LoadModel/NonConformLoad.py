In the simplest case, the injections can be defined directly using only the attributes “pfixed” and “qfixed”. -  The injections for a NonConformLoad can be defined as a percentage of the NonConformLoadGroup with the attributes “pfixedPct” and “qfixedPct”.  In this case, the associated NonConformLoadGroup would have to have an associated NonConformLoadSchedule. -  The attributes defining the affect of voltage and frequency on the injection defined by an associated LoadResponseCharacteristic should be supplied, if they are available, but are not required.
