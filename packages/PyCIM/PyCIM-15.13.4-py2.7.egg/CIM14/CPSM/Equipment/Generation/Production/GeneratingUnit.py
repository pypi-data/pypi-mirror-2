class GeneratingUnit(Equipment):
    """A single or set of synchronous machines for converting mechanical power into alternating-current power. For example, individual machines within a set may be defined for scheduling purposes while a single control signal is derived for the set. In this case there would be a GeneratingUnit for each member of the set and an additional GeneratingUnit corresponding to the set.-  To define a GeneratingUnit requires defining the initial real power injection, net real power limits, and the status of the unit.  The initial injection is defined using  the attribute “initialP”. -  The net real power limits can be defined in three ways; 1) with the attributes “maxOperatingP” and “minOperatingP”, or 2) with the attribute  “ratedNetMaxP” or 3) with the attributes “ratedGrossMinP” and “ratedGrossMaxP” used in conjunction with an associated GrossToNetActivePowerCurve. -  The control status of the unit is defined with the attribute “genControlSource”, but it is not required.  The participation factor attributes “longPF”, “normalPF”, and “shortPF” are not required. -  The GeneratingUnit class should only be used in cases where the more specific classes, HydroGeneratingUnit and ThermalGeneratingUnit, do not apply. -  The attributes governorSCD, maximumAllowableSpinningReserve, nominalP, startupCost, and variableCost are not required.
