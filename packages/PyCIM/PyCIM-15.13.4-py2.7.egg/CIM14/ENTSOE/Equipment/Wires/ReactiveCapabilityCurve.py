For each active power value there is a corresponding high and low reactive power limit  value. Typically there will be a separate curve for each coolant condition, such as hydrogen pressure.  The Y1 axis values represent reactive minimum and the Y2 axis values represent reactive maximum.-  ReactiveCapabilityCurves are not required if the reactive power limits of the SynchronousMachine do not vary with real power output. -  By convention, the Y1 axis values represent reactive minimum and the Y2 axis values represent reactive maximum. -  Because the x value will always be specified in MW and the y values will always be specified in MVAr, the xMultiplier, y1Multiplier, and y2Multiplier attributes do not need to be supplied.
