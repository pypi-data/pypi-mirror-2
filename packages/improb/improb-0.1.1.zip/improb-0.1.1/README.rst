improb is a Python module for working with imprecise probabilities.

The library supports arbitrary finitely generated conditional lower
previsions, belief functions, linear-vacuous mixtures, probability
measures, n-monotone lower probabilities, Mobius transforms, and
Choquet integration.

Various decision criteria, such as Gamma-maximin, Gamma-maximax,
interval dominance, and maximality, are implemented. For sequential
decision problems, the library has a convenient interface for
constructing decision trees of any size, and has algorithms for
solving them by normal form, or by normal form backward induction.
