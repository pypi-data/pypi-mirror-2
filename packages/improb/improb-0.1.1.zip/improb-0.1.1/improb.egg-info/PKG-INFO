Description: The library supports arbitrary finitely generated conditional lower
        previsions, belief functions, linear-vacuous mixtures, probability
        measures, n-monotone lower probabilities, Mobius transforms, and
        Choquet integration.
        
        Various decision criteria, such as Gamma-maximin, Gamma-maximax,
        interval dominance, and maximality, are implemented. For sequential
        decision problems, the library has a convenient interface for
        constructing decision trees of any size, and has algorithms for
        solving them by normal form, or by normal form backward induction.
