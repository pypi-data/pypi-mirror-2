Description: vs.dashboardmanager
        ===================
        
        ``vs.dashboardmanager`` provides a templating mechanism for dashboard pages and
        a push mechanism for transfering portlets of dashboard template pages into the
        dashboard of individual site members or all members of a Plone group. Consider
        ``vs.dashboardmanager`` as a kind of remote adminstration tool for dashboards.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * add ``vs.dashboardmanager`` to the ``eggs`` and ``zcml`` options of
        your buildout.cfg and re-run buildout (under Plone 4 you can omit the
        ``zcml`` slug)
        
        * either create a new Plone site using the ``Dashboard Manager`` extension profile
        or install it through the Plone site setup control panel
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        * use the dashboard management option from the Plone control panel or add
        ``@@dashboard-manager`` to the URL of the Plone site to see the dashboard
        manager. It will list the available dashboards. When installed from scratch it
        should say "No portletpage template available".
        
        * create a new Dashboard Manager from the standard "Add" drop-down menu in the
        folder contents view. It is a standard content-type and available anywhere on
        the site.
        
        * provide title, description and body text. This will be shown above the
        portlets the dashboard manager will contain later. Save.
        
        * add some portlets (using the ``Portlets`` tab). The portlets are left as-is
        and may be configured to your liking. You may add up to four portlets here.
        
        * push the portlet into the dashboard of a user or a group using
        the ``assigments`` tab of the Dashboard Manager. Pick a Plone group from the
        drop-down field or type the name of an individual user and push "Assign
        portlets to dashboard(s)".
        
        * as a user that had a dashboard manager assigned to visit the /dashboard. It
        should show the portlets you assigned.
        
        * a portlet page is a page containing portlets as its content and can not be
        assigned to users or roles, but behaves like a normal page. Add portlets using
        the ``Portlets`` tab. The portlets are left as-is and may be configured to your
        liking. You may add up to four portlets here.
        
        * if the is not what you expect check the criteria by which your portlets
        show their content. I.e., the events portlet may show published events only,
        etc.
        
        
        Tested
        ======
        * tested with Plone 3.3.X
        * tested with Plone 4.0.X
