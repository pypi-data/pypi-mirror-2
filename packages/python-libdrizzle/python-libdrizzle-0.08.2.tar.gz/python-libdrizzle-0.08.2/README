These are the Python wrappers for libdrizzle, which can be used to connect
to Drizzle or to MySQL. 

To build them, setup.py expects to find libdrizzle/drizzle_client.h and
libdrizzle/drizzle_server.h in an include path and libdrizzle.so in a ld path.

If they are not in those places, you'll probably want to add CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to the command line. Or fix setup.py.

The C source here is generated from SWIG. That, as well as the larger build 
process of which it is a part and from which this source package is derived
can be checked out from launchpad via:

bzr branch lp:drizzle-interfaces
