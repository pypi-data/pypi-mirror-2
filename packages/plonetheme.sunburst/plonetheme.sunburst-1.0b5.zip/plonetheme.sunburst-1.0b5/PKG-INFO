Description: Sunburst, a theme for Plone 4
        =============================
        
        Sunburst is a modern, minimalist, grid-based theme for Plone 4.
        
        Goals:
        
        - Keep the theme color-neutral (black, white, grays), so it meshes with any
        company logo and doesn't feel like it requires color adjustment for doing the
        10-minute-show-it-to-the-boss exercise.
        
        - The theme does not use any tables for layout, and is based on the Deco grid
        approach which is currently in use on plone.org. It works perfectly in all
        browsers, including IE6.
        
        - The grid works in both fixed-width and flexible-width modes, there's a
        commented-out section in the top of the CSS file you can enable if you want
        fixed-width layout.
        
        - No substantial markup changes outside of the table removal - class and ID
        names are kept.
        
        - The theme uses some CSS3 features, but degrades gracefully.
        
        - The theme does not use any DTML.
        
        - When viewed on a device with less than 640px width, the portlets neatly tuck
        under the main content area. This means that the site works well with
        CSS-enabled devices like tablets and phones that may have limited resolution.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b5 - 2010-05-03
        ------------------
        
        - Show current page in breadcrumbs, give the surrounding div the same height
        as our portal-headers for consistency.
        [esteele]
        
        - Dtml vars removed.
        Fixes: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10492
        [pelle]
        
        - Improved :focus which is an accessibility requirement, a level 2 priority
        point/AA. This was removed entirely due to the reset css in use, so
        specifying :hover then remember :focus as well.
        Fixes: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10472
        [pelle]
        
        - Fix for global navigation colliding with portlets, bread crumb etc.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10491
        [pelle]
        
        1.0b4 - 2010-05-01
        ------------------
        
        - Always enable breadcrumbs on all levels. ploneCustom contains an example on
        how to disable them on the first levels. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9987 again.
        [elvix, hannosch]
        
        - Added tests for "ajax_load" query string in main_template. When found, skip
        anything expensive that isn't going to show in an ajax overlay.
        The plone.app.jquerytools overlay helper sets the ajax_load query string
        to prevent browser caching.
        [smcmahon]
        
        - Removed fixed vertical position for overlays. This needs to be computed on
        display so that overlays don't display out of the viewport on long pages.
        [smcmahon]
        
        - Remove display:none for navigation portlet header. This is now handled
        through the template.
        [esteele]
        
        - Improved style of blocked portlets.
        [igbun]
        
        - Be carefull with adding ie hacks to IEFixes.css since Sunburst Theme
        uses IE8.js.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10417.
        [pelle]
        
        - Improved overlay styling e.g. for openid overlay.
        Done when stepping trough #10035 and it's tried to make as general as possible.
        [pelle]
        
        
        1.0b3 - 2010-04-10
        ------------------
        
        - Improved mobile styling.
        [limi]
        
        - Less disruptive styling for inline validation, it no longer shifts the form
        around in a significant way.
        [limi]
        
        - Remove unused personalize_form template and unneeded copies of the author
        template and prefs_main_template.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Updated styling for breadcrumbs, tags/keywords, and added styles for the
        currently selected nav tree item.
        [limi]
        
        - Adjusted viewlets so that Sunburst uses the viewlet configuration from
        plone.app.layout.viewlets.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Improved call-out and pull-quote styling.
        [limi]
        
        - Improved general overlay styling.
        [limi]
        
        - Improved history pop-up styling.
        [limi]
        
        - Fix columns in prefs_main_template.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Pass the current view to getColumnsClass.  This is needed if the view is not
        the @@plone view and it has different portlets (such as on the portlet
        management views).  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10320.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Repositioned the searchbox for RTL scripts.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10367.
        [emanlove]
        
        - Stop hiding the (now) non-existing sendto action.
        Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8800.
        [dukebody]
        
        - Fixed help_biography message.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        1.0b2 - 2010-03-05
        ------------------
        
        - Established Sunburst-specific browser view similar to ploneview and moved
        out the logic of applying special width/position CSS class on
        #portal-column-content from main_template.pt to that view.
        Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10292
        [spliter]
        
        - Set up testing environment for the package
        [spliter]
        
        - Inline images should not have borders (makes it hard to insert graphics that
        are part of a sentence, or similar), and we don't have any other round
        elements in the basic design (the edit bar is special, and is round to
        differentiate itself from the "stable elements"), so removed the rounded
        corners for image frames.
        [limi]
        
        - Added some padding to a <fieldset> in order to have better-looking forms.
        References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9824
        [spliter]
        
        - Moved language selector and personal tools viewlets into plone.portalheader
        viewlet manager and re-positioned them relatively instead of absolute.
        Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10252
        [spliter]
        
        - Hide the "up to groups overview" link and fieldset border in the "add group"
        overlay.
        Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10149
        Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10150
        [stuttle]
        
        - Replaced references to redundant #region-content to #content in stylesheets.
        References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10231
        [spliter]
        
        - Adding back IE8.js to fix Sunburst for IE6/7, re-enabling mobile device
        support.
        [limi]
        
        - Adding IE8.js v2.1 beta, this should resolve the issues with @media selectors,
        and let us re-enable the mobile support again. Thanks to Dean Edwards for
        fixing this.
        [limi]
        
        1.0b1 - 2010-02-18
        ------------------
        
        - Added example CSS to ploneCustom.css on how to enable the first levels of
        breadcrumbs. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9987.
        [limi]
        
        - Removed #region-content and .documentContent from all templates, as they are
        redundant. See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10231 for details.
        [limi]
        
        - Updated prefs_main_template.pt and personalize_form.pt to the recent markup
        conventions.
        References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
        [spliter]
        
        - Moved 'content' slot to the same place as it is in CMFPlone's
        main_template.pt. Having the same slot in different places is confusing.
        References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
        [spliter]
        
        - Wrapped .contentViews and .contentActions with <div id="edit-bar"> in
        author.pt.
        [spliter]
        
        - Add html id to personal bar actions.
        [paul_r]

        RTL scripts.

        - Updated templates to disable the columns with 'disable_MANAGER_NAME'
        pattern.

        Re-fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9651.
        [emanlove]
        
        - Some sunburst for the site actions.
        Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10176
        [pelle]
        
        - Remove common CSS registries.

        [dukebody]
        
        - Remove the ability for anonymous to send author feedback again. A quick
        survey of integrators showed that this wasn't desirable.
        [esteele]
        
        - Avoid the test function in the main_template. It doesn't exist in view page
        template files.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Simplify the bodyClass construction.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Use renderBase from new location.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Remove obsolete charset definition for the global_cache_settings macro.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Follow the getSectionFromURL change in CMFPlone.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Just a markup polishing - <metal> tags don't need explicit "metal" for
        defining slots.
        [spliter]
        
        - Copied preferred structure of 'main' slot from default main_template
        [spliter]

        above and below content respectively for Sunburst.

        [pelle]

        #region-content, portal messages might also appear out side
        that area in an overlay, portlet etc.
