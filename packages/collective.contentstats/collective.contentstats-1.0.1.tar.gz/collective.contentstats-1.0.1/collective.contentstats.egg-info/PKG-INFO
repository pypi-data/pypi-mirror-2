Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.contentstats  adds a section to the Plone control panel
        showing summary statics of the content of the site. Specifically, 
        it provides a table listing the number of content items broken down
        by portal type versus review state. Non-zero entries are linked to
        a listing of the respective items. Access to the page requires the
        'Manage portal' permission.
