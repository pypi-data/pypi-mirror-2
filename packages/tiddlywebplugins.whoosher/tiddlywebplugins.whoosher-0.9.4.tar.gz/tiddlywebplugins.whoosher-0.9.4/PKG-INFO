Description: 
        A TiddlyWeb[1] plugin which provides a Whoosh[2]-based indexing and
        search interface.
        
        The plugin:
        
        * Replaces the search interface of the store that is in use (if any).
        * Provides a system for structured queries of the index.
        * Automatically updates the index when a new tiddler is written to
        the store.
        * Provides twanager commands for reindexing the entire store, and
        making command line searches of the index.
        
        See the module documentation for installation and configuration
        instructions: pydoc tiddlywebplugins.whoosher
        
        * Explore methods for dynamically managing the schema.
        The Whoosh docs suggest that adding fields can be done
        on the fly.
