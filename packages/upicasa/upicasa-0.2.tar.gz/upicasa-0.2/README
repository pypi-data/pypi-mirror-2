upicasa
=======

This is a simple Python script that allows one to upload photos into
Google's PicasaWeb from the command line.  It can also list the albums
that already exist on the user's PicasaWeb gallery and can create a
new album to upload the photos to.

`upicasa` is still very rough on the edges, the user interface is not
bulletproof, no exceptions are handled.  It is, however, useful for
the author, and can be useful for someone else.

Installing
----------

`upicasa` is a Python package packaged with `setuptools`, therefore you
can install it running `easy_install upicasa` or by directly invoking
the `setup.py` script::

    python setup.py install

`upicasa` uses Google's `gdata` Python library to access the PicasaWeb
services.  It is the only real depencency beside Python.

Using
-----

When first invoked, `upicasa` will prompt for the Google account name
and password.  It will ask whether to save these credentials.  The
saved username and password are normally stored in the file
`~/.config/upicasa/auth`.  If this file exists, upicasa will not query
the credentials interactively.

You can list the albums like this::

   upicasa -l

You can create a new album and upload photos to it like this::

   upicasa -n "Album name" *.jpg

You can add photos to an existing album like this::

   upicasa -a "Album name" *.jpg

The album is matched by a substring of a name.  If the string provided
will match more that one album, you will get a list of matching albums
and no photos will be uploaded.
