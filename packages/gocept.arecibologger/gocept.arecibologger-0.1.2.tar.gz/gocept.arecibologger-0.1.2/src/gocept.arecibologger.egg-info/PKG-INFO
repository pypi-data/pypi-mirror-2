Description: Arecibo is a GAE application that is useful to gather errors from a set of
        servers, specifically errors that occur while processing web requests.
        
        gocept.arecibologger is a patch for Zope 2's site error log that will send as
        much data (tracebacks, request data, user name, ...) to the Arecibo server as
        possible.
