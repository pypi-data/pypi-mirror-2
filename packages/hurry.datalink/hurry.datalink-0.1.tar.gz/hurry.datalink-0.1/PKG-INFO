        Introduction
        ============
        
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import hurry.datalink from ``hurry.datalink`` and ``.need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          from hurry.datalink import datalink
        
          .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
          datalink.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and
        ``hurry.resource``, and making sure that the original resources
        (shipped in the ``datalink-build`` directory in ``hurry.datalink``)
        are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and the Zope
        Toolkit. If you depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your
        ``setup.py``, the above example should work out of the box. Make sure
        to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.datalink before release
        ====================================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.datalink``.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.datalink``, an extra step should be
        taken. Follow the regular package `release instructions`_, but before
        egg generation (``python setup.py register sdist upload``) first
        execute ``bin/datalinkprepare <version number>``, where version number
        is the version of the release, such as ``1.0.1``. This will
        download the hurry.datalink library of that version and place it in the
        egg.
