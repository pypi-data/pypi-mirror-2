Description: LDAP control panel for Plone
        ============================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        plone.app.ldap provides a user interface in a Plone site to manage
        LDAP and Active Directory servers.
        
        This package succeeds the simplon.plone.ldap package.
        
        It builds on the functionality provided by LDAPMultiPlugins_, LDAPUserFolder_
        and PloneLDAP_.
        
        
        Active Directory
        ----------------
        
        Active Directory provides an LDAP interface to its data. Using this interface
        Plone can use both users and groups from an Active Directory system. Writing
        to Active Directory is not supported.
        
        With Active Directory you can use two different properties as login name:
        `userPrincipalName` and `sAMAccountName`. `sAMAccountName` is the plain account
        name without any domain information and is only unique within a single domain.
        If your environment only uses a single AD domain this option is the best
        choice. For environments with multiple names the `userPrincipalName` attribute
        can be used since this includes both account name and domain information.
        
        
        Since Plone does not support binary user ids it is not possible to use the
        `objectGUID` attribute as user ids. Instead you can use either `sAMAccountName`
        or `userPrincipalName`. The same criteria for choosing a login name also
        apply to selecting the user id attribute.
        
        Standard LDAP
        -------------
        
        LDAP directory servers are fully supported. LDAP users and groups are usable
        as standard Plone users and groups can be me managed normally. Creating and
        deleting users and groups is supported.
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        This package works with Plone 3 and Plone 4. Plone 3 users should install a version in the 1.1.* series (e.g. plone.app.ldap < 1.2), as releases after version 1.2 are only tested in Plone 4.
        
        You need to install PloneLDAP_ and its requirements in your Zope instance
        before you can use plone.app.ldap. This can easily be done by downloading
        its product bundle and extracting that in your Products directory.
        
        Once the package is installed, it will be available as an add-on named
        "LDAP support", and this add-on can be activated in a Plone instance
        using the Add-ons section of the Plone Control Panel. Be careful, as this
        package also currently installs LDAPUserFolder as a dependency, which makes
        the add-on "LDAPUserFolder CMF Tools" available. Do not install this add-on!
        It will replace the portal_membership tool and make your Plone site
        unusable.
        
        Install without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        First you need to install this package in the python path for your
        Zope instance. This can be done by installing it in either your system
        path packages or in the lib/python directory in your Zope instance.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope instance.
        This can be done by putting a plone.app.ldap-configure.zcml file in the
        etc/pakage-includes directory with this content::
        
        <include package="plone.app.ldap" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a
        package or Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing plone.app.ldap
        is even simpler. You can install it by adding it to the eggs line for your
        instance::
        
        [instance]
        eggs = plone.app.ldap
        zcml = plone.app.ldap
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope to
        configure plone.app.ldap.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Installing the development version
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To specify the current `development`_ version you may use::
        
        eggs = plone.app.ldap==dev
        
        .. _development: https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.ldap/trunk#egg=plone.app.ldap-dev

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 (2010-03-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Added a tab for display and modifying the cache settings.
        [kteague]
        
        - Send out notification events for all object additions/modifications/removals
        so that configuration always gets propogated to the LDAPUserFolder object.
        [kteague]
        
        - Changed the base class for LDAPConfiguration so that it gets properly
        rooted in the site (otherwise LDAPConfiguration.__parent__ goes into
        an infinite loop, pointing to a fresh PersistenComponents instance who's
        parent is in turn LDAPConfiguration).
        [kteague]
        
        - Updated the HTML to wrap all control panel forms in a form tag so that
        tabs are properly displayed in Plone 4.
        [kteague]
        
        - Fixed i18n domain changes from Vincent. The message factory was defined in
        the wrong ``__init__.py``.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Changed i18n domain from plone to plone.app.ldap.
        Registered locales directory.
