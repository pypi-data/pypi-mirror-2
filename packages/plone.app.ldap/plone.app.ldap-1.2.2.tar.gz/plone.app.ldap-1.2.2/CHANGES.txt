1.2.2 (2010-08-18)
------------------

- LDAPProperty fields can now be marked as a Binary property.

- Ability to import/export an LDAP configuration using generic setup.
  This feature is the same as the one provided by collective.genericsetup.ldap
  and exports made with that product can be imported into plone.app.ldap.
  During import all existing servers, general settings and schema
  will be overwritten from config file - but no interfaces or cache
  settings are changed.
  [kteague]

  in the plone.app.locales package now.

----------------

  so that configuration always gets propogated to the LDAPUserFolder object.

- Changed the base class for LDAPConfiguration so that it gets properly
  rooted in the site (otherwise LDAPConfiguration.__parent__ goes into
  an infinite loop, pointing to a fresh PersistenComponents instance who's
  parent is in turn LDAPConfiguration).

- Updated the HTML to wrap all control panel forms in a form tag so that
  tabs are properly displayed in Plone 4.
