Description: collective.pdfjs - Plone integration for Mozilla's JavaScript PDF reader
        ========================================================================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds pdf.js support for Plone.
        
        When installed, it will provide an additional view for the File content-type.
        
        If the view detects a PDF file, it will attempt to render it inline using
        pdf.js. If the user browser doesn't have JavaScript enabled, it will embed
        any available PDF reader plugin (Acrobat's, Google Chrome native, etc).

        Support
        =======
        
        Right now pdf.js has rudimentary support for PDFs, so a lot of them might not
        render correctly or even work at all. Development is moving ahead fast, so
        expect improvements in the near future.
