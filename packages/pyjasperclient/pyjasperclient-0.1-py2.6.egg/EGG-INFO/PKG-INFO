Description: A simple python module to run and get generated reports deployed on a JasperServer. Module works by consuming the SOAP web service provided by the JasperServer. It is ideal for python projects that uses JasperServer for reporting and needs a way to access/publish these reports to their users easily. However, this project is not a management interface for JasperServer, you should use its web interface and/or iReport for that.
