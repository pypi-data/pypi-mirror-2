Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        This Plone product gives you a new set of `Ploneboard`__ workflows. The idea is to update the basic
        workflows to use also new Plone 3 style roles.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Ploneboard
        
        **Be aware**. Yes, we overwrite the basic Ploneaboad workflows, so you don't need to perform additional
        operation (just "Manage Security Setting" inside ZMI).
        
        Also some basic Ploneboard security settings has been changed. Forum inside private folders *are no more
        accessible*. No more "Anonymous" explicit view permissions!
        
        Roles
        -----
        
        Keeping *Member*, *Manager* and *Reviewer* role settings, the new workflows set add special permissions
        also to *Reader* and *Contributor* roles.
        
        Here a general explanation:
        
        `Reader`
        A Reader can access forum and discussions normally. The only difference from a Reader and a normal
        user is inside *private* boards (or when boards are put inside private folders).
        A Reader can't see not-published comments.
        `Contributor`
        A Contributor can write inside a forum. Basic Ploneboard workflows manage only the Member or Owner
        role, so is not simple to make groups of users that can write inside forums and other not.
        In general, Contributors can write inside boards and forum not accessible to all members of the
        site.
