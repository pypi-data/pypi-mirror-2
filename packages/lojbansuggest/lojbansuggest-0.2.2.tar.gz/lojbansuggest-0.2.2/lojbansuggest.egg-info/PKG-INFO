Description: =============
        Lojbansuggest
        =============
        
        This library is made up of two independent parts:
        
        suggest
        -------
        
        This is a library and a thin commandline that takes a lojban sentence and looks for common beginner mistakes and makes suggestions for corrections.
        
        tree
        ----
        
        This is a library to turn a lojban sentence into an approximate analysis of the semantics (for example what sumti goes into what place of what tanru unit).
        
        At the moment it's not very powerful.
