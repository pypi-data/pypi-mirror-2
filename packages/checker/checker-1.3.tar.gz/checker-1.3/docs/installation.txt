Installation
============

The easyiest way to install Checker is::

  easy_install checker

This will give you an executable ``checker`` script in the same
location as your other python global scripts.

Or, if you're using `zc.buildout`, use the `zc.recipe.egg`__ recipe to
get a checker script as follows:

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg

.. topic:: buildout.cfg
 :class: file

 ::

   [buildout]
   parts = checker

   [checker]
   recipe = zc.recipe.egg    
   eggs = checker

 .. -> buildout_cfg

.. check the above actually works:

  >>> write(sample_buildout,'buildout.cfg',buildout_cfg)
  >>> print system(buildout)
  Installing checker.
  Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/checker'.
  <BLANKLINE>

This will give you an executable ``checker`` script in the ``bin``
directory of your buildout.

A recommended way to install Checker is to have the :ref:`configuration
folder <configuration-folder>` be a subversion checkout containing
:file:`buildout.cfg`, :file:`bootstrap.py` and your
:file:`checker.txt`.
