        README
        ======
        
        This package provides a private python package index server based on Zope 3.
        
        The MyPyPi server provides everything you need for setup a private or public
        pypi mirror. It also allows to release closed source packages. Together with
        lovely.buildouthttp you can setup a secure pypi mirror which you can use
        for your deploy management of public and private packages. Private packages can
        get protected by security based on groups, roles and users. The mypypi server
        supports a secure way to mix private and public packages at the same time.
        
        We recommend to install the mypypi server behind an apache proxy for SSL
        offload like any other SSL secured zope application. But if you like to use a
        very simple setup without SSL, the mypypi server should work on port 80 as a
        standalone application server as well.
        
        
        INSTALL
        -------
        
        The installation process is very simple and described in the INSTALL.txt file.
        
        
        SETUP
        -----
        
        After you have a working MyPyPi server setup, you have to configure your
        projects if you like to have real protection. We use an enhanced setup.py
        file in our packages which will prevent a release to pypi.python.org. Such
        a setup.py change will also make the release process easier:
        
        The changed setup.py in your private egg should look like::

        As you can see we lock the server to a given URL within the line::
        
        LOCK_PYPI_SERVER = "http://pypi.your-domain.tld/eggs"
        
        After doing the above changes to your setup.py file, you can issue::
        
        python setup.py register sdist upload
        
        or just::
        
        python setup.py sdist upload
        
        The lock method will ensure that the repository only get released to the right
        repository and prevents that the egg get published by accident to the official
        pypi.python.org server at any time.
        
        
        BUILDOUT
        --------
        
        Since we use a HTTPS connection, we have to improve our buildout.cfg file and
        use the lovely buildouthttp recipe which enables SSL support. See
        lovely.buildouthttp for more information about this recipe. Also make sure
        you setup the required information like described in the lovely recipe if you
        use the recipe the first time.
        
        You private egg buildout.cfg should look like::
        
        [buildout]
        prefer-final = true
        extends = http://download.zope.org/zope3.4/3.4.0/versions.cfg
        versions = versions
        develop = .
        index = https://pypi.foobar.ch/private
        extensions = lovely.buildouthttp
        parts = test
        
        [test]
        recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
        eggs = smart [test]
        
        As you can see, our mypypi server is used as the index. We use the private
        page at https://pypi.your-domain.tld/private because this page forces the
        urllib handler to use the basic auth realm authentication. Again; note this
        requires a working lovely.buildouthttp setup using a .httpauth file in your
        HOME folder. Such a .httpauth file looks like::
        
        pypi,https://pypi.your-domain.tld,your-login,your-password
        
        Note the realm is always pypi. This is defined at the serverside and could
        not get changed. Of course could we change the realm in our mypypi server, but
        since ``setuptools`` uses this hardcoded realm (eeek), buildout upload would
        not work anymore if we would change the realm to something else. Let us know
        if this will become a real problem for you.

        =======
        INSTALL
        =======
        
        configuration
        -------------
        
        This package contains a configuration script which is not usual in a
        distribution package like this. The configure script can be used for initialize
        or change the server configuration before or after you installed this package.
        
        the recommented steps are::
        
        - python configure.py
        
        - python bootstrap.py
        
        - bin/buildout (on *nix) or bin\buildout.exe (on windows)
        
        The configure.py can get used before or after running bootstrap and buildout
        as ``python configure.py``.
        
        The configure.py script allows you to choose devmode, localhost, port and
        management user login settings. All the collected values get written to the
        app.cfg file which is included in buildout.cfg.
        
        If you don't like to use the configure.py script at any time, we recommend to
        write your own app.cfg e.g. myapp.cfg and include them in buildout.cfg
        ``extends`` and exclude the existing app.cfg. This will prevent you from
        override the app.cfg by using the configure.py script.
        
        
        step by step
        ------------
        
        First checkout the mypypi package from pypi.python.org and store it on your
        mypypi server.
        
        As next, before we call ``python bootstrap.py``, run the configure.py script
        with the following command::
        
        python configure.py
        
        This will ask you for some input like::
        
        Would you like to setup with devmode (y/n): y
        Choose your server hostname: localhost
        Choose your server port: 8080
        Note:
        Distutils does not work with a port other then 80.
        Use a proxy server running at port 80 for access the
        MyPyPi server at port 8080
        
        Choose a managment user login: Manager
        Choose a management user password: password
        Choose a password encryption (plain/md5/sh1): plain
        Generated configuration file 'app.cfg'
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        New buildout configuration files successfully created
        You have to run bootstrap and buildout now
        
        After running buildout there is a configure script installed
        You can run this counfiguration script again with bin/configure
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        
        After setup the app.cfg file within the configure.py script, you can run
        bootstrap.py as usual with the following command::
        
        python bootstrap.py
        
        After bootstrap you can run buildout as usual with the following command::
        
        bin/buildout
        
        After setup your mypypi server with buildout, you can test your installation
        with the following command::
        
        bin/test -py1
        
        There is also a coverage recipe installed which you can use as usual with the
        following commands::
        
        bin/coverage-test
        bin/coverage-report
        
        After running the converage scripts, you can see the generated coverage report
        in the new generated ``coverage/report`` folder. There should be an all.html
        file which you can start with.
        
        Congratulations, you just configured and installed your mypypi server. If you
        like to use another ip/port, devmode or manager user login, you can just
        reconfigure your setup with calling configure again with the following command::
        
        python configure.py
        
        This will again ask you for some input like::
        
        Would you like to setup with devmode (y/n): y
        Choose your server hostname: localhost
        Choose your server port: 8080
        Note:
        Distutils does not work with a port other then 80.
        Use a proxy server running at port 80 for access the
        MyPyPi server at port 8080
        
        Choose a managment user login: Manager
        Choose a management user password: password
        Choose a password encryption (plain/md5/sh1): plain
        Generated configuration file 'app.cfg'
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        New buildout configuration files successfully created
        You have to restart your server now
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Recognize the note in the generated output. Your new app.cfg configuration file
        will only get used after you restart the mypypi server.
        
        After you reconfigured your server, the old configuration file called
        ``app.cfg`` get renamed to ``app.cfg-<year><month><day>-<hour>-<minute>``
        This means you can simply revert your changes if you rename an old app.cfg*
        file to app.cfg and restart your server.
        
        
        start
        -----
        
        Now you can start your new mypypi server with the following command::
        
        bin/app
        
        
        nix
        ---
        
        We recommend to use spervisord as a autostart option for mypypi. But any other
        concept like using a init.d script should work for mypypi. A simple supervisord
        programm like this should work:
        
        [program:mypypi]
        directory = <mypypi root path>
        command = <mypypi root path>/bin/app
        priority = 10
        autostart = true
        autorestart = true
        
        
        windows
        -------
        
        There is also a windows service installation script. You can simply run the
        windows service installation with the following command::
        
        python bin\winservice.py install
        
        You can also remove the service with the following command::
        
        python bin\winservice.py remove
        
        run the follwoing command windows service management for more options::
        
        python bin\winservice.py help
        
        After install your service, go to the serivce controll panel and check the
        service configuration. The service get installed as ``MYPYPI Windows Service``.
        If you like to rename the service make sure you removed a previous service
        installation, change winservice configuration section in buildout.cfg and
        run buildout again. After that install your service again like described above.
        Changing your winservice configuration in buildout.cfg should be compatible
        with the configure.py script concept like any other option in buildout.cfg.
