BETA: WinSys - Python tools for the Windows Administrator
=========================================================

*We read MSDN so you don't have to*

Introduction
------------

WinSys is a Python package which wraps aspects of the Windows API to make
them more Pythonic and usable by Windows administrators directly
from the interpreter or as part of a wider set of applications.
It targets recent versions of Python and reasonably recent versions of Windows
although it's not yet up to speed on Vista/W7 & x64.

It is unashamedly platform-specific: no hint of a concession towards more
Unix-like operating systems.  You can read about the design
philosophy and decisions in :ref:`about-winsys`. If you want to see some
examples, have a look in the :ref:`cookbook`. Or visit the :ref:`overview`
page for an overview and rationale.

WinSys is developed as an Open Source project and the project home,
together with issues list and browseable source code is at:

  http://code.google.com/p/winsys/

If you're interested in helping with the project let me know and I'll
add you to the project members list.

Example
-------

Copy a registry key from HKLM to HKCU and set its permissions so that
only the current user has change access while everyone else gets read.
Then dump the details of the new top-level key, including its security.

..  literalinclude:: cookbook/registry/copy_key.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

This example makes use of the :mod:`registry`, :mod:`accounts` and :mod:`security` modules.
You can see :ref:`discussion <copy-one-registry-key-to-another>` of this example and more in the :ref:`cookbook`.

Download
--------

* easy_install::

    FIXME: NOT YET -- easy_install winsys

* MSI installers & Zipped archives

  Visit http://timgolden.me.uk/python/downloads/winsys/
  and then::

    winsys-x.y.z.msi

  or::

    unzip winsys-x.y.z.zip
    python setup.py install

* Subversion trunk::

    svn co http://winsys.googlecode.com/svn/trunk winsys

  and then either add that directory into sys.path (I use a .pth
  file but whatever works for you) or run setup.py install from
  there. I don't do setuptools, so you can't do setup.py develop
  unless you tweak the setup.py code.
