Changelog of checkoutmanager
============================

1.2.1 (2010-08-06)
------------------

- Bugfix: when reporting an error, the os.getcwd method itself would get
  printed instead of the *output* of os.getcwd()...


1.2 (2010-08-04)
----------------

- If the config file doesn't exist, just print the config file hints instead
  of the generic usage info.

- Fixed issue #4: the generic 'buildout' name is stripped from the path.
  svn://somewhere/customername/buildout/trunk is a common pattern.

- Added -v option that prints the commands and the directory where you execute
  them.  Fixes issue #3.

- Reporting on not yet checked out items when running "checkoutmanager
  missing".  Fixes issue #2.

- Checking return code from executed commands.  On error, the command and
  working directory is printed and also the output.  And the script stops
  right away.  Fixes #5.

- Updated the documentation, for instance by mentioning the config file name
  and location.


1.1 (2010-08-02)
----------------
