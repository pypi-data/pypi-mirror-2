How to use?
===========


You can import various resources from ``js.extjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page. The two basic resource sets that you'll
probably need are these ::

  >>> from js import extjs
  >>> extjs.basic.need()
  >>> extjs.basic_with_ux.need()

You can also include individual resources ::

  >>> from js.extjs import adapter, extjs, ux
  >>> adapter.ext.need()
  >>> extjs.js.need()
  >>> extjs.css.need()
  >>> extjs.all.need()
  >>> ux.all.need()
  >>> ux.js.need()
  >>> ux.css.need()

You can also import themes ::

  >>> from js.extjs import theme
  >>> theme.gray.need()
  >>> theme.access.need()
