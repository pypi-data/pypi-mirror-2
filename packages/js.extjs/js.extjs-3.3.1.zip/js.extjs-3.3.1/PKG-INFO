        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `ExtJS`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`ExtJS`: http://www.sencha.com/products/js/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.extjs``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import various resources from ``js.extjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page. The two basic resource sets that you'll
        probably need are these ::
        
        >>> from js import extjs
        >>> extjs.basic.need()
        >>> extjs.basic_with_ux.need()
        
        You can also include individual resources ::
        
        >>> from js.extjs import adapter, extjs, ux
        >>> adapter.ext.need()
        >>> extjs.js.need()
        >>> extjs.css.need()
        >>> extjs.all.need()
        >>> ux.all.need()
        >>> ux.js.need()
        >>> ux.css.need()
        
        You can also import themes ::
        
        >>> from js.extjs import theme
        >>> theme.gray.need()
        >>> theme.access.need()
