Installation
------------

To install, execute the command:

  python setup.py install

from the bigfloat-0.1/ directory.  You may need to become superuser,
or use the 'sudo' command.

The setup script will try to find a suitable installed version of the
MPFR library.  If it fails to find the library, or if you have
multiple copies of the MPFR library on your system and setup.py finds
the wrong one, you can edit the bigfloat_config.py.in file to specify
the location of the MPFR library on your system directly, and then
retry the install.

Prerequisites
-------------

This package requires Python 2.5 or later.  The MPFR and GMP libraries will
need to be already installed on your system.

If your MPFR library is located in an unusual place, or you have
multiple MPFR libraries installed on your system and you want to
specify which one to use, you may need to edit the bigfloat_config.py
configuration file.  You may also need to edit this file if the MPFR
or GMP libraries were built using a non-standard configuration.
