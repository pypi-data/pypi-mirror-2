Description: The bigfloat package is a Python package providing arbitrary-precision
        correctly-rounded floating-point arithmetic.  It is implemented as a
        wrapper around the MPFR library (http://www.mpfr.org).
        
        Features:
        
         - correct rounding on all operations;  precisely defined semantics
           compatible with the IEEE 754-2008 standard.
        
         - the BigFloat type interacts well with Python integers and floats.
        
         - full support for emulating IEEE 754 arithmetic in any of the IEEE binary
           interchange formats described in IEEE 754-2008.  Infinities, NaNs,
           signed zeros, and subnormals are all supported.
        
         - easy control of rounding modes and precisions, via Python's 'with'
           statement.
