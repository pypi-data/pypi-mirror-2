Description: 
        gpustats is a PyCUDA-based library implementing functionality similar to that
        present in scipy.stats. It implements a simple framework for specifying new CUDA
        kernels and extending existing ones. Here is a (partial) list of target
        functionality:
        
        * Probability density functions (pdfs). These are intended to speed up
          likelihood calculations in particular in Bayesian inference applications, such
          as in PyMC
        
        * Random variable generation using CURAND
