Description: ======================================
        relocatable python virtual environment
        ======================================
        
        package inspired a lot by ian bicking's virtualenv_ but created in fashion
        that it can be relocated freely through the filesystem, renamed, backuped, ...
        
        .. _virtualenv: http://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/
        
        second nice main feature is, that you can customize your python environment
        via ``{{ENV}}/pythonrc.py`` in any curious way you want.
        
        install
        -------
        
        you can install this package from pypi::
        
          pip install RVirtualEnv
        
          # or
        
          easy_install RVirtualEnv
        
          # or just clone this repository
          git clone http://github.com/kvbik/rvirtualenv
        
        you should definitely try development version,
        there is python3_ (it really works, tests are passing)
        and support and venvwrapper_ (emulating ``source PY/bin/activate``)
        
        .. _venvwrapper: http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/
        .. _python3: http://diveintopython3.org/
        
        to create new virtual environment just call::
        
          virtualenv ~/PYENV1
        
          # or directly from this repo
        
          ./virtualenv.py ~/PYENV2
        
        usage
        -----
        
        to enable environment, do::
        
          # on unix
          export PYTHONPATH=~/PYENV1:$PYTHONPATH
        
          # on windows
          set PYTHONPATH=c:\PYENV1;%PYTHONPATH%
        
        after that, you can call any python command (eg: ``pip`` or ``easy_install``, ``ipython``, ...)
        and it will have access to your virtual environment.
        
        if you don't want to mess up with environment, just call our wrapper::
        
          # on unix
          ~/PYENV1/bin/python [any [params]]
        
          # on win
          c:\PYENV1\Scripts\python.bat [any [params]]
        
        it should work with mod-wsgi ``python-path`` option as well,
        and you can enable it in runtime via ``site.addsitedir(venv_directory)``.
        
        tests
        -----
        
        if you are interested in testing this package, it should support many standard ways of running tests.
        nose is used for test discovery.
        
        you can run any of these commands:
        
         * ``python setup.py test``
         * ``nosetests``
         * ``./tests/test_all.py``
        
        in the ``setup.py`` case you just have to wait a little, until setuptools_dummy_ are downloaded,
        because it is a build dependency.
        
        .. _setuptools_dummy: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools_dummy/
        
        package was tested on:
        
         * archlinux with python 2.6
         * ms windows with python 2.6
         * debian lenny with python 2.5
         * debian etch with python 2.4
        
        but there is no build environment yet.
        
        why
        ---
        
        main reasons why this package came into existence:
        
         * it does not copy python binary
         * it does not symlink core python libraries
         * you can just set up PYTHONPATH env variable
           and you can use any system-wide command (eg: easy_install, pip)
         * you can tune ``pythonrc.py`` file to your needs
           in any curious ways (useful for debugging/testing)
        
        todo
        ----
        
        it does not have all the features, that ian's virtualenv has,
        because i don't know, which one of them are important..
        
        probably ``no-site-packages`` is important and it can be simulated
        by patching your ``pythonrc.py`` file right now.
        
        ``boot scripts`` even ian does not like very much and i think
        there should be some init scripts only or installation of some package should be called.
