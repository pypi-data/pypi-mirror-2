Getting Started
===============

-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------

Swift development currently targets Unbuntu Server 10.04, but should work on 
most Linux platforms with the following software:

* Python 2.6
* rsync 3.0

And the following python libraries:

* Eventlet 0.9.8
* Webob 0.9.8
* Setuptools
* Simplejson
* Xattr
* Nose
* Sphinx

-----------
Development
-----------

To get started with developemnt with Swift, or to just play around, the
following docs will be useful:

* :doc:`Swift All in One <development_saio>` - Set up a VM with Swift installed
* :doc:`Development Guidelines <development_guidelines>`

----------
Production
----------

We do not have documentation yet on how to set up and configure Swift for a 
production cluster, but hope to begin work on those soon.
