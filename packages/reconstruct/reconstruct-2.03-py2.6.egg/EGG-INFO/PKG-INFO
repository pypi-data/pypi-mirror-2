Description: 
        ReConstruct is a continuation of the excellent 'Construct' library by 
        Tomer Filiba <tomerfiliba [at] gmail dot com>. 
        The original description is reproduced below. This version is maintained

        == Original Description ==
        Construct is a library for parsing and building of data structures (binary or
        textual).
        
        The original description is 
        It is based on the concept of defining data structures in a declarative manner,
        rather than procedural code: more complex constructs are composed of a hierarchy
        of simpler ones. It's the first library that makes parsing fun, instead of the
        usual headache it is today.
        
        Construct features bit and byte granularity, symmetrical operation (parsing
        and building), component-oriented design (declarative), easy debugging and
        testing, easy to extend (subclass constructs), and lots of primitive constructs
        to make your work easier (fields, structs, unions, repeaters, meta constructs,
        switches, on-demand parsing, pointers, etc.)
