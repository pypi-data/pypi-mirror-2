Description: simple encode decode w/ private key, based on the base64 encode and decode.
        
        Initially developed for turning database ID's into URL's without exposing the
        ids in the url, or having a bot iterate over the values.
        
        Also useful for storing passwords which need to be converted back to
        clear text, in alphanumeric form given a secret word. This is NOT encryption
        nor a hash. This is NOT cryptographically safe. For that an SSL public/private
        key pair is preferred. For situations where the encoded string is already
        protected by a privileged account, and the secret key is stored in a
        configuration file which is also protected by a privileged login, this system
        is secure. It is secure by virtue of having all its elements secure, and
        mitigates the risk of compromise of either one of those vectors (but not both).
        
        This is good for websites which store the secret key in a configuration file
        on disk, and the encoded word in a database (accessible by a different user),
        and where both values are not in transactional memory except for the duration
        of decoding and using the decoded string, which should be immediate.
        
        Requires Python 2.4 or greater
        
        
        >>> from simpleencode import encode, decode, mksecret
        >>> secret_key = mksecret()
        >>> secret_key
        "{iIb'd/y!%w$'BDL&6NkWf`LeyZvp+}6QFm3~sBQjP)[!8xZ}a"
        >>> encoded = encode("Some Text", secret_key)
        >>> encoded
        'S1lwA3QLQhwBcRJcUxs5fQNSekZjNjwREzFzNSthFh9kNj5PSzl6Cih6HxtWa1lvKhE='
        >>> decode(encoded, secret_key)
        'Some Text'
        >>>
