        Installing
        ==========
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.5 and 4.0b3) and archetypes.schemaextender.
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or via the setup.py script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing collective.cu3er is even simpler. You can install collective.cu3er by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = collective.cu3er
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        CU3ER \kju:bər\, an image slider initially conceived to create 3D transitions between slides, turned out to be a convenient and multifunction solution that can be applied in a range of website building areas, from content slider to feature slider and image & banner rotator. Consider using it when you want to grab the user’s attention, and you’ll be delighted by the results!
        
        If you’d like to experience more creativity in web development, are striving to more visually appealing content, and prefer to have even more unique image transitions on your websites, try the CU3ER! Its magic is astonishing!
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        There are no special requirements for setting it up and running other than a limited knowledge of web authoring:
        
        * Flash Player 9+,
        
        * XML Basics,
        
        * SWFObject (embedding .swf files into web pages),
        
        * Applications for image editing (especially for creating & exporting slides).
        
        
        Add slider
        ----------
        
        To add a new slider just edit your Archetype based content item and go to the 'Cu3er' tab. Add the values for height and width and your CU3ER XML config (a sample is provided, see the link in the description text or the sample below). Finally enable your CU3ER slider and press save.
