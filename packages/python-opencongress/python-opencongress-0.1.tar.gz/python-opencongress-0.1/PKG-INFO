        Installation
        ============
        
        python-opencongress is a simple Python module that is installable by placing the ``opencongress`` directory onto your system path.
        
        As it is available on the Python Package Index, you can install python-opencongress using your favorite package manager::
        
           pip install python-opencongress
           
           easy_install python-opencongress
        
        You can also install directly from the git master branch using the pip package manager::
        
           pip install git+http://github.com/cpharmston/python-opencongress.git#egg=opencongress
        
        Or you can download python-opencongress and install locally::

        Usage
        =====
        
        The OpenCongress.org API is exposed via the ``opencongress.Api`` class. To create an instance of the class::
           
           import opencongress
           api = opencongress.Api('your_api_key_here')
        
        Substituing ``your_api_key_here`` for your own API key, which can be obtained at the `API documentation page <http://www.opencongress.org/api>`_.
        
        Most OpenCongress.org API functionality is available through the ``opencongress.Api`` class. For example, to view a list of all bills introduced during the `111th Congress <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111th_United_States_Congress>`_::
        
           >>> api.bills(congress=111)
           [
              <OpenCongress Bill object (H.R.5472 America RISING Act of 2010)>,
              <OpenCongress Bill object (H.R.2521 National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2009)>,
              <OpenCongress Bill object (H.R.5473 Investing Income at Home Act of 2010)>,
              <OpenCongress Bill object (H.R.5455 New Philadelphia, Illinois, Study Act)>,
              <OpenCongress Bill object (H.R.5454 Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010)>,
              ...
           ]
        
        To view a list of all congresspeople who are members (by name) of the `Kennedy family <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_family>`_ and Democrat party::
        
           >>> api.people(last_name='Kennedy')
           [
              <OpenCongress Person object (Ambrose Kennedy)>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Andrew Kennedy)>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Sen. Edward Kennedy [D, MA])>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Joseph Kennedy)>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Martin Kennedy)>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Michael Kennedy)>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Rep. Patrick Kennedy [D, RI-1])>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (Robert Kennedy)>,
              <OpenCongress Person object (William Kennedy)>
           ]
