Changelog
=========

1.1 (2010-06-06)
Automatic publishing now happens n days after submit, in case a document is rejected and then submitted again.
Validator for year (2010-2050)

1.0 (2010-06-06)
Alfa version
Created recipe with ZopeSkel
Added content type "Boardfile"
Added browser views
Added workflow "multiapprove workflow" so all "Reviewers" can "approve" or "reject" the boardfile
Added time based trasaction... the "Boardfile" gets published after "n" days if none of the "Reviewers" has "rejected" it.
Added "Boardfile-listing" view. 
Warning: This will give you an error if you use it on a folder containing something else than "Boardfiles", so it is in "skins" dir and not in ues.

To do: 
======
Change time to "creation date", it should take 20 days from creation, not from "last transaction in history".
Far to much code in "browser"... could need some help here.
Time before the transaction is now about 14 minutes (for testing), will change to 20 days.
