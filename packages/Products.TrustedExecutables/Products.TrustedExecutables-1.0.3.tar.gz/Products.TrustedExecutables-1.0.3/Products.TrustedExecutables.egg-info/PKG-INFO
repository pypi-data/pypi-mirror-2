Description: TrustedExecutables is a set of executable objects unrestricted
        by Zope[2]'s security.
        Currently, it contains 'TrustedPageTemplateFile',
        'TrustedFSPageTemplate' and 'TrustedFSPythonScript'.
        'TrustedFSPageTemplate' and 'TrustedFSPythonScript' are registered
        with the filename extensions 'xpt' and 'xpy', respectively.
        
        As Zope's security checks are expensive, avoiding them can
        drastically speed things up.
        
        On the other hand, these objects must make their own security
        checks at places where access control is required.
        
        Use with extreme care!
        
        
        ATTENTION: Use this version only with Zope 2.11 or above.
        Versions for Zope 2.7 upto Zope 2.9 can be found on
        http://www.dieter.handshake.de/pyprojects/zope
        
        ATTENTION: It is not unlikely that this product breaks between
        Zope releases, as it uses undocumented implementation artefacts.
        It is probably not very difficult to fix things again but
        you will need programming skills to do so.
