Description: Sake
        ----
        
        An easier way to create `Stackless Python`__ based applications.
        
        __ http://www.stackless.com/
        
        Stackless has a lot to offer, but it does so in a low-level and straightforward
        manner.  Anyone who wishes to make use of it has to implement a lot of the same
        supporting functionality, in order to get to the stage where they can implement
        an application on top of it.  And then there is the domain knowledge that needs
        to be factored into this supporting code, which may only be identified as
        problems arise and are solved.
        
        Sake aims to be a high-level framework that developers can take, and
        immediately use to get started building an application.  All the standard
        supporting logic that gets written, has been written.  Written within
        `CCP Games`__, domain knowledge and corner cases learned over ten years of
        Stackless usage has been taken into account.
