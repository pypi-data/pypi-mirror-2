Description: Introduction
        ============
        PDFtoOCR processes text in PDF documents using OCR. This is needed
        when text cannot be extracted from a (scanned) PDF. PDFtoOCR uses content rules to
        schedule the OCR processing. The processing cannot be done one the fly, for
        example with a custom TextIndexNG plugin. Processing large PDF documents using
        OCR is a time/processor consuming task.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        On the operating system
        -----------------------
        PDF to Text uses three tools that are available for under Linux. The
        cooperation with the tools is only tested in Debian. But it the will probably
        work in in other \*NIX enviroments.
        
        Install requirements, PDF to OCR uses the following programs:
        
        - pdftotext, checks if OCR processing is necessary
        - ghostscript, converts the pdf documents to tiff images
        - tesseract,  does the OCR processing (make sure you've got all language packs!*)
        
        Set the environment variables:
        
        - The environment variable *$GS* must be set and point to the ghostscript binary.
        - The environment variable *$TESSERACT* must be set and point to the tesseract binary.
        
        
        On the Plone site
        -----------------
        
        Add a content rule
        
        - Event trigger: Object modified and object added
        - Condition: Content type is file
        - Actions: Store OCR output from a PDF in searchable text
        
        Assign content rule to a Plone site or a folder
        
        Install cron4plone and add the following cronjob: portal/@@do_pdf_ocr_index
        
        Usage
        =====
        Just add a file with a PDF document. Optionally you can select the language so the OCR
        engine can use dictionaries when indexing. Only a limited amount of languages are
        supported by Tesseract.
        
        An overview of indexed documents is found in the control panel, 'PDF to OCR status'.
        In this status page (re)indexing of documents is possible.
        
        
        PDF Processing
        ==============
        
        Each time a file is added or modified  the unique id (uid) of the file is added
        to a queue. This queue is persistent and has two functions, for indexing en reindexing.
        The indexing function uses the queue to process the documents. When reindexing is used all
        files in the queue history are processed.
        
        If the text from a PDF document is extracted using pdftotext no OCR is done. Else the
        OCR extracts the text and stores it the content type file. The ATFile is patched with an
        extra field to accommodate the extracted text and the language of the PDF.

        Maybe a good alternative in the future, uses tesseract but hard to setup and
        still too much beta:
