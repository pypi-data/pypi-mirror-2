django-trawler
==============

Trawler is a django app designed to help audit a group of people or organization
in terms of **phishing** awareness.

When used as directed, you can launch your own *phaux-phishing* campaign and track
the members of your organization that actually *follow the link* or load the 
images (either by default or by choice depending on how their mail client is 
configured).

This software was largely inspired by a presentation given by 
`Lance Spitzner <http://www.securingthehuman.org/>`_
in which he described his approach to phishing awareness.

Installation
------------
If you're familiar with django apps, this process will be familiar.
Install using your choice of ``pip`` or ``easy_install``: ::
    
    $ pip install django-trawler
    
    or ...
    
    $ easy_install django-trawler


Configuration
-------------

In your project settings module:

* Add ``trawler`` and ``django.contrib.admin``  to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
* Ensure your mail settings are appropriate (the app needs to send mail).
* Ensure you set the domain for your server (django ``Sites`` framework) so
  admin links point to the right place.
* Include ``trawler.urls`` in your urlconf.
* **MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE** ``DEBUG = False`` before launching a campaign (or your
  *targets* will see nice django 404 pages).
