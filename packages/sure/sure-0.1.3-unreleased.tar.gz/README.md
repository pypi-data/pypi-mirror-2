## testing behaviour of objects

    from sure import that

    assert that("something").is_a(str)
    assert that("something").like("some")
    assert "thing" in that("something")

    class FooBar:
        attribute_one = "simple"

    assert "attribute_one" in that(FooBar)
    assert that(FooBar).equals(FooBar)

    # and so on ...

## iterable objects


### testing length

    from sure import that

    animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'chicken']

    assert that(animals).len_is(3)
    assert that(animals).len_is(['list with', 'three', 'elements'])

### testing elements

    from sure import that

    class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
        self.kind = 'mammal'
        self.name = name

    mammals = [
      Animal('dog'),
      Animal('cat'),
      Animal('cat'),
      Animal('cow'),
    }

    assert that(mammals).the_attribute('kind').equals('mammal')
    assert that(mammals, within_range(1, 2)).the_attribute('name').equals('cat')

#### further

    class animal(object):
        def __init__(self, kind):
            self.attributes = {
                'class': 'mammal',
                'kind': kind,
            }

    animals = [
        animal('dog'),
        animal('cat'),
        animal('cow'),
        animal('cow'),
        animal('cow'),
    ]

    assert that(animals).in_each("attributes['class']").matches('mammal')
    assert that(animals).in_each("attributes['class']").matches(['mammal','mammal','mammal','mammal','mammal'])

    assert that(animals).in_each("attributes['kind']").matches(['dog','cat','cow','cow','cow'])

## contextual setup and teardown

    import sure

    def setup_file(context):
        context.file = open("foobar.xml")

    def teardown_file(context):
        context.file.close()

    @sure.that_with_context(setup_file, teardown_file):
    def file_is_a_xml(context):
        "this the file is a xml"
        sure.that(context.file.read()).contains("<root>")
