Lupa change log
================

0.11 (2010-08-07)
------------------

* error reporting on Lua syntax errors failed to clean up the stack so
  that errors could leak into the next Lua run

* Lua error messages were not properly decoded


0.10 (2010-07-27)
------------------

* much faster locking of the LuaRuntime, especially in the single
  threaded case (see
  http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577336-fast-re-entrant-optimistic-lock-implemented-in-cyt/)

* fixed several error handling problems when executing Python code
  inside of Lua


0.9 (2010-07-23)
-----------------

* fixed Python special double-underscore method access on LuaObject
  instances

* Lua coroutine support through dedicated wrapper classes, including
  Python iteration support.  In Python space, Lua coroutines behave
  exactly like Python generators.


0.8 (2010-07-21)
-----------------

* support for returning multiple values from Lua evaluation

* ``repr()`` support for Lua objects

* ``LuaRuntime.table()`` method for creating Lua tables from Python
  space

* encoding fix for ``str(LuaObject)``


0.7 (2010-07-18)
-----------------

* ``LuaRuntime.require()`` and ``LuaRuntime.globals()`` methods

* renamed ``LuaRuntime.run()`` to ``LuaRuntime.execute()``

* support for ``len()``, ``setattr()`` and subscripting of Lua objects

* provide all built-in Lua libraries in ``LuaRuntime``, including
  support for library loading

* fixed a thread locking issue

* fix passing Lua objects back into the runtime from Python space


0.6 (2010-07-18)
-----------------

* Python iteration support for Lua objects (e.g. tables)

* threading fixes

* fix compile warnings


0.5 (2010-07-14)
-----------------

* explicit encoding options per LuaRuntime instance to decode/encode
  strings and Lua code


0.4 (2010-07-14)
-----------------

* attribute read access on Lua objects, e.g. to read Lua table values
  from Python

* str() on Lua objects

* include .hg repository in source downloads

* added missing files to source distribution


0.3 (2010-07-13)
-----------------

* fix several threading issues

* safely free the GIL when calling into Lua


0.2 (2010-07-13)
-----------------

* propagate Python exceptions through Lua calls


0.1 (2010-07-12)
-----------------

* first public release
