        About GoogleSharing
        -------------------
        
        GS manages the sharing of documents stored in the Google servers and their synchronization
        from the Plone application to Google Docs service. In this way, when a Plone user changes
        the roles of other users on a specific document, for instance to share the document with
        them or to restrict their access to the document, GS changes the document sharing attributes
        in the Google Docs service accordingly. So, if a Plone user assigns another user the Editor
        role on one of his documents, the other user will be able to read and modify that document
        through his Google account.
        
        To associate Plone and Google accounts, GS assumes that the email address attribute of Plone
        users corresponds to their Google account.
        
        The mapping of roles, on each specific document, from Plone to Google Docs is based on the
        following rules: Plone users who have both the Editor and the Reader roles on a specific
        document are assigned the writer role on the correspondent document on Google servers; Plone
        users who have the Editor or the Reader roles are assigned the writer or reader role,
        respectively, on the correspondent document on Google servers. The Collaborator and Reviewer
        roles have not been considered.
