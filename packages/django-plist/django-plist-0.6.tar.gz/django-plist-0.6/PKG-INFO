        ============
        
        django-plist is a Django application that trivializes the serialization of
        Django model objects into the XML format used by Property List files on the
        Cocoa platform (iPhone/Mac OS X).

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.6 - 2010-05-20
        ----------------
        - Do not serialize private model fields. Fixes bug introduced with multi
        database support in Django 1.2.
        - PropertyListSerializationFailedError now sends a meaningful message to
        Exception.__init__ to make stacktraces useful when debugging.
        
        0.5 - 2010-01-19
        ----------------
        - Added as_plist keyword argument to render_array shortcut to control
        serialization of objects without altering Model classes, see updated
        documentation in docs/overview.markdown.
        - Tests: Added test suites for shortcut functions and generic views
        - Tests: Added Cocoa integration tests in cocoa_tests/. These require a
        functional GCC/Cocoa suite to run.
        - Bug: Dictionary keys are now properly escaped as #PCDATA
        - Bug: render_dictionary() rendered None as a string. None is now
        rendered as an empty dictionary.
        - Bug: datetime.datetime objects should not output fractions of seconds.
        - Bug: datetime.date objects should render with T00:00:00, Cocoa fails to
        read the property list otherwise.
        - Bug: datetime.time objects now render as string, Cocoa apps barf on the
        <date>HH:MM:SS</date> elements.
        
        0.4 - 2009-10-29
        ----------------
        - Added missing files to Manifest.in which caused build errors when installing
        with setup.py
        - XML data is now properly escaped in <string>
        
        0.3 - 2009-10-28
        ----------------
        - Raises an error when rendering fails, i.e. when the object is not a model,
        does not have a as_plist() method or is not a basic type.
