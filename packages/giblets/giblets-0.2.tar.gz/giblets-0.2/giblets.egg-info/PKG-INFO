Description: 
        Giblets is a simple plugin system based on the component architecture of
        `Trac <http://trac.edgewall.org>`_.
        In a nutshell, giblets allows you to declare interfaces and discover components
        that implement them without coupling.
        
        Giblets also includes plugin discovery based on file paths or entry points along with
        flexible means to manage which components are enabled or disabled in your application.
