        Tamarin is a Django app used for parsing storing S3 bucket log data in local
        models. Said data can be used for monitoring:
        
        * Resource usage for each bucket
        * Which hosts are consuming the most buckets
        * Which files are being downloaded most frequently
        
        Tamarin's only purpose is to retrieve the logs from S3, parse them, and store
        them locally in a Django model. You'll need to write your own queries and
        reports, or use another third party app that builds on Tamarin.
