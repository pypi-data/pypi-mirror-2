EC2 TODO
- The post instance commands need work. I would like to update my dns
and have puppetca on the puppet master called to sign the cert.
- An instance is tagged with the name but any associated EBS volume 
isn't, it should be.
- Figure out how to set ebs volumes as permanent.
- I should do more checks to make sure my defined setup matches the 
active setup, for example load balancers checks for instances in an 
existing load balancer but nothing else.
- Setup autoscaling - http://boto.s3.amazonaws.com/autoscale_tut.html
- Add in reserved instances
