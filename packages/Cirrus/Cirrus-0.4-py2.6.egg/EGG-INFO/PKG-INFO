        dns_setup reads a simple yaml file that only defines credentials, 
        domains and bind style zone files used to define the domains.
        
        update_host.py will update a single host entry in an route 53 domain. It 
        relies on environment variables and command line arguments rather than 
        yaml. I use it to accomplish dynamic dns for ec2 with the simple init 
        script found in contrib. Since this will potentially be on many many 
        machines for security I suggest you use a dns subdomain and different 
        AWS credentials with this script.
