        dns_setup reads a simple yaml file that only defines credentials, 
        domains and bind style zone files used to define the domains.
        
        Amazon Alias entries are treated as a TXT dns type with the value 
        starting with 'Alias '. This is to work around the dnspython library 
        does not allowing invalid dns types.
        
        update_host.py will update a single host entry in an route 53 domain. It 
        relies on environment variables and command line arguments rather than 
        yaml. I use it to accomplish dynamic dns for ec2 with the simple init 
        script found in contrib. Since this will potentially be on many many 
        machines for security I suggest you use a dns subdomain and different 
        AWS credentials with this script.
        
        
        ============
        Known Issues
        ============
        - The TTL on route 53 aliases is set automatically but is specified in 
        the source zone file. This means it is easy to end up with a mismatch 
        which the tool always sees as something to fix.
        - Using txt entries for route 53 aliases is less than ideal, a better 
        solution should be found.
