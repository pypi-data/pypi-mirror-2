Description: This package patches the web application server Zope to work around
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/740831.
        
        The bug causes Zope to deliver wrong responses after a request using
        ``Response.write`` has suffered a ``ConflictError``. The patch
        prevents Zope from retrying such requests and logs an error message when it
        tries. The bug effect is thus limited to a single request.
        
        Note that even with this patch Zope does not behave fully correctly: in
        case of a ``ConflictError``, it may
        deliver a (maybe partial) response even though the transaction has
        been aborted. The client does not get feedback for the transaction rollback.
        The only indication is the log record written.
        
        ``Response.write`` is inherently unsafe in the face of ``ConflictError``.
        The only reliable fix is not to use it at all.
        
        
        The (monkey) patch gets installed when this package is imported.
