Description: =======
        Feed2MB
        =======
        
        Feed2mb updates a microblog account from a xml feed.
        It's a free alternative to services like Twitterfeed.
        
        To install feed2mb:
        
        1. install python-twitter:  http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/
        
        1. install python-blogger: http://code.google.com/p/python-blogger/
        
        1. install feedparser:  http://www.feedparser.org/
        
        
        Install it with: python setup.py install or download and instal it with easy-install: easy-instll feed2mb
        
        
        Running:
        --------
        * You need to set your feed and your microblog account.
        * You need to create a configuration file. You can see a sample with the command *feed2mbx -p*. It will looks like:
        
        ::
        
        [global]
        interval = 00:05
        
        [twitter]
        url = http://example.com/rss
        username = twitter_username
        password = password
        mode = title
        items = 5
        shortener = is.gd
        service = twitter
        
        [identica]
        url =http://example.com/rss
        username = identica_username
        password = password
        mode = title
        items = 5
        shortener = is.gd
        service = identica
        
        [wordpress]
        url =  http://example.com/rss
        username = wordpress_username
        password = password
        mode = title
        items = 5
        shortener = is.gd
        service = wordpress
        xmlrpc_url = http://example.com/wordpress/xmlrpc.php
        
        The url is the url for the feed that you want to publish, mode can be 'text' (140 chars of your post text) or 'title' (your post title, with a link). The interval should be in the global section and is the interval in which the feed2mb will publish your last posts. In the sample, feed2mb will check the provided feed each hour. The shortener will let you choose the shortener service, and the options now are is.hd, migre.me and tinyurl. The default will be tinyurl.
        
        The supported services now are twitter, identica and wordpress (thoughr xmlrpc api, other blogs can work, but I didn't had time to test). When the service is wordpress, you should add a xmlrpc_url to point to you wordpress xmlrpc endpoint. And the mode will be ignored: the post on the feed will be 100% replicated on wordpress, as-is.
        
        You can add how many sections for services as you like.
        
        Run it with the command feed2mb. It will update your microblog with your latest posts, in the interval that you have set.
