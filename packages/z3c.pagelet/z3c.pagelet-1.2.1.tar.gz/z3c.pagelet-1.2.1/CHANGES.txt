1.2.1 (2010-07-29)
------------------

- ``zope.app.pagetemplate.metaconfigure.registerType`` was moved to
  ``zope.browserpage``, so it gets now imported from there.

- Dropped test dependency on ``zope.app.security``, it is no longer
  needed.

- Using python's ``docteest`` instead of deprecated
  ``zope.testing.doctest[unit]``.


1.2.0 (2009-08-27)
------------------

- Fix untrusted redirect to google.com in tests. It's now forbidden by default
  by newer zope.publisher versions.

- Change ``zope.app.publisher`` dependency to new ``zope.browserpage``, as it
  has much less dependencies.

1.1.0 (2009-05-28)
------------------

* Got rid of dependency on ``zope.app.component`` by requiring
  ``zope.component >= 3.7``.

* Removed hard dependency on ``zope.formlib``: the pagelet forms now
  only get defined when ``zope.formlib`` is available. Tests still
  depend on ``zope.formlib``, so it got a test dependency.

* Made sure long_description renders fine on pypi.


1.0.3 (2009-02-27)
------------------

* Allow use of ``z3c.pt`` using ``z3c.ptcompat`` compatibility layer.

* Add support for context-specific layout and content template lookup,
  using (view, request, context) discriminator. This is compatible with
  context-specific templates introduced in z3c.template 1.2.0.

* Don't do rendering in pagelet's __call__ method when request is a redirection.

* Add sphinx-based HTML documentation building part to the buildout.


1.0.2 (2008-01-21)
------------------

* Added a `form.zcml` which can be included to have a template for
  ``PageletAddForm``, ``PageletEditForm`` and ``PageletDisplayForm``.


1.0.1 (2007-10-08)
------------------

* Added ``update()`` and ``render()`` method to ``IPagelet`` which was
  not specified but used.

* Fixed a infinite recursion bug when a layout template was registered for "*"
  but no content template was registered for a pagelet.
