#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open more
# you do so at your own risk!

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions

#####         Cluster settings       #####
##########################################
# Salt supports automatic clustering, salt creates a single ip address which
# is shared among the individual salt components using ucarp. The private key
# and all of the minion keys are maintained across the defined cluster masters
# The failover service is automatically managed via thse settings

# List the identifiers for the other cluster masters in this manner:
# [saltmaster-01.foo.com,saltmaster-02.foo.com,saltmaster-03.foo.com]
# The members of this master array must be running as salt minions to
# facilitate the distribution of cluster information
#cluster_masters: []

# The cluster modes are "paranoid" and "full"
# paranoid will only distribute the accepted minion public keys.
# full will also distribute the master private key.
#cluster_mode: paranoid
