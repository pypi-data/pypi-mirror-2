Introduction
============

This library packages `Sammy.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Sammy.js`: http://sammyjs.org

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.sammy``) are published to some URL.
