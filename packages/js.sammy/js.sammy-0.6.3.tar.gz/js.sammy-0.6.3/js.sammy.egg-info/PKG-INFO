        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Sammy.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Sammy.js`: http://sammyjs.org
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.sammy``) are published to some URL.

        How to use?
        ===========

        these resources to be included on a page::
