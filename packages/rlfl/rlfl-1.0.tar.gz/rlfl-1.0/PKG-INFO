        RLF. Rogue Like Functions

        ===========
        
        Alpha Version 1.0
        
        This is a collection of functions for roguelike games for use with the python programming language. FOV, 
        pathfinding, projection, LOS and various helper functions. This is here to aid me in my hobby to create
        a python roguelike. The aim is to build on alot more AI and fun stuff.
        
        This is not a display library and contains no display functions.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        	python3 setup.py install
        OR
        	python setup.py install
        
        Then 
        	import rlfl
        
        Compile instructions (makefile).
        --------------------------------
        
        create a makefile (see makefile_32x or makefile_64x examples) and simply `make rlfl-python`. To use
        with python place the `rlfl.so` file in your python path and `import rlfl`. Make sure to specify 
        the python lib version you wish to compile against. Currently tested against python2.7 and 
        python3.1
        
        RLF can be built into a c lib without python support with `make rlfl`.
        
        This code has not been tested on windows.
