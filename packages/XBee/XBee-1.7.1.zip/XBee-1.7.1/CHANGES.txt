v1.5.0, 6/27/10 -- Initial Packaging. Fully restructured into a unified API with tests.
v1.7.0  6/29/10 -- Now supports both Series 1 and Series 2 modules 
                   (the API turned out to be the same). Additionally:
                   * API frame logic was split into its own class, APIFrame
                   * XBee renamed to XBeeBase
                   * XBee1 renamed to XBee
                   * Tests updated to reflect changes; API frame tests
                     moved to test_frame.py, now test APIFrame instead of
                     XBee base class
                   * Test files renamed appropriately
                   * PyLint score improved
                   * Various docstring updates
                   * Updated example code to reflect changes
v1.7.1 7/7/2010 -- Bug fix: Now supports receiving I/O data with 64-bit addressing
                   * Previously, an exception was raised when a packet with ID 0x82
                   * arrived, which contains I/O samples with a 64-bit source address
                   * This has been fixed.
