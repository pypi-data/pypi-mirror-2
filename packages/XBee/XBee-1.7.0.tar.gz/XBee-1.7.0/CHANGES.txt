                   * XBee1 renamed to XBee
                   * Tests updated to reflect changes; API frame tests
                     moved to test_frame.py, now test APIFrame instead of
                     XBee base class
                   * Test files renamed appropriately
                   * PyLint score improved
                   * Various docstring updates
