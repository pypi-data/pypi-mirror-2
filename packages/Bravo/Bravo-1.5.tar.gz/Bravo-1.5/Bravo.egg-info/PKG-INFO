Description: =====
        Bravo
        =====
        
        Bravo is a elegant, speedy, and extensible implementation of the Minecraft
        Alpha/Beta protocol. Only the server side is implemented. Bravo also has a few
        tools useful for examining the wire protocols and disk formats in Minecraft.

        Installing
        ==========
        
        Bravo currently requires Python 2.6 or any newer Python 2.x. It is known to
        work on CPython and PyPy. (PyPy support is currently on hiatus and will return
        when numpy support returns to PyPy.)
        
        Bravo ships with a standard setup.py. You will need setuptools/distribute, but
        most distributions already provide it for you. Bravo depends on the following
        external libraries from PyPI:
        
         * construct, version 2.03 or later
         * numpy
         * Twisted, version 10.1 or later
        
        For IRC support, Twisted Words is required; it is usually called
        python-twisted-words or twisted-words in package managers.
        
        For IC support, Twisted 10.2 is required.
        
        For web service support, Twisted 11.0 is required and the Twisted Web package
        must be installed; it is generally called python-twisted-web or twisted-web.
        
        **Important: Bravo's installation process is currently broken. Until this
        notice is removed, please don't install, just run directly from the git
        checkout. It's easier and runs just as well.**
        
        Debian & Ubuntu
        ---------------
        
        Debian and its derivatives, like Ubuntu, have Numpy and Twisted in their
        package managers.
        
        ::
        
         $ sudo aptitude install python-numpy python-twisted
        
        If you are tight on space, you can install only part of Twisted.
        
        ::
        
         $ sudo aptitude install python-numpy python-twisted-core python-twisted-bin python-twisted-conch
        
        A Note about Ubuntu
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        You will need Ubuntu 10.10, for Twisted 10.1. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is not
        suitable, unless the Twisted 10.1 package from Ubuntu 10.10 is installed.
        
        Fedora
        ------
        
        Numpy and Twisted can be installed from the standard Fedora repository.
        
        ::
        
         $ sudo yum install numpy python-twisted python-twisted-conch
        
        Gentoo
        ------
        
        Gentoo doesn't (yet) carry a Construct new enough for Bravo, but it does have
        Numpy and Twisted.
        
        ::
        
         # emerge numpy twisted twisted-conch
        
        LFS/Virtualenv/Standalone
        -------------------------
        
        If, for some reason, you are installing to a very raw or unmanaged place, and
        you want to ensure that everything is built from the latest source available
        on PyPI, we highly recommend pip for installing Bravo, since it handles all
        dependencies for you.
        
        ::
        
         $ pip install Bravo
        
        Bravo can also optionally use Ampoule to offload some of its inner
        calculations to a separate process, improving server response times. Ampoule
        will be automatically detected and is completely optional.
        
        ::
        
         $ pip install ampoule
        
        Running
        =======
        
        Bravo includes a twistd plugin, so it's quite easy to run. Just copy
        bravo.ini.example to bravo.ini, and put it in one of these locations:
        
         * /etc/bravo/
         * ~/.bravo/
         * Your working directory
        
        And then run the TAC to start Bravo!
        
        ::
        
         $ twistd -ny bravo.tac
        
        Alternatively, a Twisted plugin is provided as well:
        
        ::
        
         $ twistd -n bravo
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        Contributing is easy! Just send me your code. Diffs are appreciated, in git
        format; Github pull requests are excellent.
        
        Things to consider:
        
         * I will be rather merciless about your code during review, especially if it
           adds lots of new features.
         * Some things are better off outside of the main tree, especially if they are
           moving very fast compared to Bravo itself.
         * Unit tests are necessary for new code, especially feature-laden code. If
           your code is absolutely not testable, it's not really going to be very fun
           to maintain. See the above point.
         * Bravo is MIT/X11. Your contributions will be under that same license. If
           this isn't acceptable, then your code cannot be merged. This is really the
           only hard condition.
        
        FAQ
        ===
        
        Why are you doing this? What's wrong with the official Alpha server?
         Plenty. The biggest architectural mistake is the choice of dozens of threads
         instead of NIO and an asynchronous event-driven model, but there are other
         problems as well.
        
        Are you implying that the official Alpha server is bad?
         Yes. As previous versions of this FAQ have stated, Notch is a cool guy, but
         the official server is bad.
        
        Are you going to make an open-source client? That would be awesome!
         The server is free, but the client is not. Accordingly, we are not pursuing
         an open-source client at this time. If you want to play Alpha, you should pay
         for it. There's already enough Minecraft piracy going on; we don't feel like
         being part of the problem. That said, Bravo's packet parser and networking
         tools could be used in a client; the license permits it, after all.
        
        Where did the docs go?
         We contribute to the Minecraft Collective's wiki at
         http://mc.kev009.com/wiki/ now, since it allows us to share data faster. All
         general Minecraft data goes to that wiki. Bravo-specific docs are shipped in
         ReST form, and a processed Sphinx version is available online at
         http://www.docs.bravoserver.org/.
        
        Why did you make design decision <X>?
         There's an entire page dedicated to this in the documentation. Look at
         docs/philosophy.rst or http://www.docs.bravoserver.org/philosophy.html.
        
        It doesn't install? Okay, maybe it installed, but I'm having issues!
         On Freenode IRC (irc.freenode.net), #bravo is dedicated to Bravo development
         and assistance, and #mcdevs is a more general channel for all custom
         Minecraft development. You can generally get help from those channels. If you
         think you have found a bug, you can directly report it on the Github issue
         tracker as well.
        
         Please, please, please read the installation instructions first, as well as
         the comments in bravo.ini.example. I did not type them out so that they could
         be ignored. :3
        
        I have an error involving construct!
         Install Construct.
        
        I have an error involving JSON!
         If you update to a newer Bravo, you won't need JSON support.
        
        I have an error involving IRC/AMP/ListOf/endpoints!
         Your Twisted is too old. You really do need Twisted 10.1 or newer.
        
        Who are you guys, anyway?
         Corbin Simpson (MostAwesomeDude) is the main coder. Derrick Dymock (Ac-town)
         is the visionary and provider of network traffic dumps. Ben Kero and Mark
         Harris are the reluctant testers and bug-reporters. The Minecraft Coalition
         has been an invaluable forum for discussion.
