Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Plone Basic is a theme for Plone 4. This theme works well on its own,
        but is meant to be used as a base for heavily-customized sites.
        
        plonetheme.basic is similar to plonetheme.sunburst -- styles were copied
        from Sunburst, and modified as outlined below. Appearances are very similar,
        but this theme has been set up to be more easily customizable.
        
         * Uses base_properties, and some variables have been added for quick
           color customizations.
         * Goes back to table-based layout.
           (Not the best, I know, but it's so simple!)
         * CSS does not use !important, except for padding on content icons
         * Cleaned up CSS selectors for efficiency

        =========
        
        0.3 (Apr-07-2011)
        -----------------
        
        - Display an arrow for the user menu in IE6/7
          [cwainwright]
        
        - For elements entered in the visual editor - moved the styles
          to a separate stylesheet and made the selectors more specific.
          This way, clearing the styles is easier, and they won't conflict
          with styles for elements in custom templates.
          [cwainwright]
        
        - fixed some default styles to work with
          webcouturier.dropdownmenu
          [cwainwright]
        
        - increased z-indexes to avoid conflicts with add-on products like
          webcouturier.dropdownmenu and collective.easyslideshow
          [cwainwright]
        
        - moved extra dtml variables to a new properties file, so that themes
          without all the variables won't error out
          [cwainwright]
        
        - Fix up the restructured text
          [claytron]
        
        - set #portal-columns borders to collapse, to remove little bits of space
          [cwainwright] 
        
        0.2 (Nov-22-2010)
        -----------------
        
        - fixed styles on livesearch
           * increased z-index for compatibility with webcouturier.dropdownmenu
           * removed white space from top for IE7
           * increased font size to base font
        
        - moved the padding on personal tools to just the header, so if the login
          link is hidden, there won't still be a grey box
          [cwainwright]
        
        - Added an uninstall profile
          [cwainwright]
