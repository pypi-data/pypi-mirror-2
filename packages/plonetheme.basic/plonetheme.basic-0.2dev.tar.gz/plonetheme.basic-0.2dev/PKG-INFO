Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Plone Basic is a theme for Plone 4. This theme works well on its own,
        but is meant to be used as a base for heavily-customized sites.
        
        plonetheme.basic is similar to plonetheme.sunburst -- styles were copied
        from Sunburst, and modified as outlined below. Appearances are very similar,
        but this theme has been set up to be more easily customizable.
        
        * Uses base_properties, and some variables have been added for quick
        color customizations.
        * Goes back to table-based layout.
        (Not the best, I know, but it's so simple!)
        * CSS does not use !important, except for padding on content icons
        * Cleaned up CSS selectors for efficiency
