Introduction
============

Plone Basic is a theme for Plone 4. This theme works well on its own,
but is meant to be used as a base for heavily-customized sites.

plonetheme.basic is similar to plonetheme.sunburst -- styles were copied
from Sunburst, and modified as outlined below. Appearances are very similar,
but this theme has been set up to be more easily customizable.

 * Uses base_properties, and some variables have been added for quick
   color customizations.
 * Goes back to table-based layout.
   (Not the best, I know, but it's so simple!)
 * CSS does not use !important, except for padding on content icons
 * Cleaned up CSS selectors for efficiency
