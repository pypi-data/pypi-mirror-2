""" This module contains procedures that are used to fetch Abstract Syntax
Trees, optionally using a database. The database is internally stored using
python pickle files.

There are two types of trees that are required.

1. The Language Agnostic Syntax Tree (LAST). This is the tree that redhawk
performs its operations on. This is what is required almost all of the time -
for querying, searching, editing (in upcoming versions), etc..

2. The various Language SPECIFIC trees. These are the trees emitted by the
parsers of the various languages - `pycparser`, the `ast` module in python,
etc.. These are used by Redhawk internally to CONSTRUCT the LAST. This is
almost never need by the API user. It is provided here since much of redhawk
internally requires it.

The ASTFetcher class is never instantiated directly. Instances of the
ASTFetcher class are created by calling either CreateLASTFetcher, or
CreateLanguageSpecificFetcher.

NOTE: The WriteDatabase method must be called MANUALLY when using the
ASTFetcher class to update the database file. This is so, for performance
reasons.


If a single tree is to be obtained, it is easier to call GetLAST, or
GetLanguageSpecificTree.

In short, only the GetLAST, and the CreateLASTFetcher functions are required
by most API users.

NOTE: None can be passed as the argument to the database argument, for any of
these functions. In such a case, it will simply fetch the required tree, by
parsing (and converting) it.
