Git-Track -- Minimalistic Bug-Tracker for Git.
==============================================

This simple bug-tracker is intended for the everyday coding, when you
want to write down some issues you want/have to fix later, but a
full-blown bug tracking such as github etc. is simply overkill.

Features:
---------

Each bug/issue has a(n)

* unique id
* message/comment
* date/time of creation
* git commit associated with it
  by default the current HEAD commit at the time of creation
* status (open/closed)
* priority

Usage:
------

The basic usage is as simple as 

1) *optional* make an alias 

alias g-tr="python /path/to/git-track/track.py"

2) use

g-tr

will give you an overview of the commands.
