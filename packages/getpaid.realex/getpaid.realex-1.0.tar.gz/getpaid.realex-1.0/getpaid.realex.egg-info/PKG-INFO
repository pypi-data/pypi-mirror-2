        This module provides a payment plugin for PloneGetPaid. It authorises payments
        using realexpayments.com.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
            * Plone 4
            * A browser with javascript support
            * jquery 1.4.3 or later
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add collective.personaltags to your buildout eggs.::
        
            eggs=\
                ...
                getpaid.realex
        
        Run buildout, restart plone.
        
        It is not necessarty to use the "Site Setup -> Add-ons" as the packages is detected by
        PloneGetPaid.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Once you have installed the module go to the "GetPaid" configlet (under "Site Setup").
        
        "Realex" should appear as an option in "Payment Options". Select it.
        
        This implementation can be used with "Visa", "Laser" or "MasterCard" cards. 
        "Laser" is being phased out. If you want to use other card types, make
        sure you test them.
        
        Realex will provide you with test credit card numbers for testing. When I requested
        a set, I received Visa, MasterCard, Laser, Switch, Amex, Delta, Diners and Solo numbers.
        
        Now go to "Payment Processor Settings".
        
        When you create an account with Realex, they will provide you with a "Merchant Id"
        and a "Secret Code". Provide these on the settings page.
        
        When you are testing against your account, you use the sub-account "internettest".
        For live usage, use "internet".
        
        Charge Description allows you to provide an alternative text for the payers statement,
        rather than the default on your merchant account. This is not guaranteed to work for
        all banks. See Realex developer documentation.
        
        You can use the plugin in "Test Mode". In this mode, data is not sent to the server.
        The plugin gives back a test. Use this mode if you do not have an account with
        a card processor and want to try it out.
        
        Limits
        ------
        
        This implementation has only been tested with Euros. It is only tested with cards available
        in Ireland.
