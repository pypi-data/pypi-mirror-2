Q: Why can't we see the amount of data yhat will be downloaded before
   clicking the "Download" button ?

A: Because we need to build the ZIP archive before the intermediate
   template for this. This might be resources expensive.

Q: I installed PloneFileZip but the icon doesn't show in the document
   actions of a folder that has files and images. What's going on ?

A: You probably forgot to tweak PloneFilesZip. Go in ZMI and open
   "Properties" tab of the "portal_fileszip" object. Select one or
   more portal types. You can do this in the configlet too.

Q: I want to show the download icon only under some conditions. I
   don't want to enable any user to download content. How do I do this?

A: In ZMI, go in the "Actions" tab of the "portal_fileszip"
   object. Change the "Condition" and/or "Permission" associated with
   the "zip" action.

Q: What about security ?

A: When building the ZIP file, PloneFilesZip includes only the files
   in content objects the user is allowed to view.

Q: The structure of the zip file looks strange. Why ?

A: Please read the README.txt at the root of PloneFilesZip. This is
   done intentionally to prevent potential duplicate file names in the
   zip file. In example, imagine you have a custom content type with
   two FileFields, an a user fills both fields with two files with the
   same name. In that case, the zip file would contain only the
   second. The zip inner format policy ensures you got both files even
   if they have the same name.

Q: I made an AT content type with a FileField an an ImageField. This
   content type doesn't show in the "Properties" tab of the
   "portal_fileszip" object in ZMI, neither in the configlet. What's
   going on ?

A: Did you build a content with standard AT schema ? Did you change
   the schema with ATSchemaEditorNG or such AT extension ? If the
   answer is "yes", you should consider to develop and register a
   custom type retriever. More details in the README.tx that comes
   with PloneFilesZip.

Q: Most of my users are Windows users, my Plone site publishes in
   UTF-8, the file names have strange characters in the zip archive.

A: You should check and change the "zipCharset" property in in the
   "Properties" tab of the "portal_fileszip" object in ZMI or in the
   configlet. Using "cp1252" may suit your needs.

Q: I made an AT based content type with a non standard file like
   field. It doesn't work. What can I do ?

A: You should develop and register a dedicated field retriever. This
   requires some AT skills. More details in the README.tx that comes
   with PloneFilesZip. You may subclass retrievers from
   PloneFilesZip/retrievers.py

Q: Got an IOError when downloading. What's going on ?

A: If the exception message is "No space left on device", you have not
   enough room in your system TMP folder. The Zip file is built in the
   server using the "tempfile" packge. Please read your system
   documentation and the "tempfile" package doc
   http://docs.python.org/lib/module-tempfile.html.
