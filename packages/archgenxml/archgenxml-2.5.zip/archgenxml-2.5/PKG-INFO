        ArchGenXML - UML to code generator for Plone
        ============================================

        Overview
        ========
        
        With *ArchGenXML* you can create working python code without writing one single
        line of python. It is is a commandline utility that generates fully functional
        Zope_ Products based on the Archetypes_ framework from UML_ models using XMI
        (``.xmi``, ``.zargo``, ``.zuml``) files. The most common use case is to generate
        a set of custom content types, possibly with a few tools, a custom Member type
        and some workflows thrown in.
        
        .. _Zope: http://zope.org
        .. _Archetypes: http://plone.org/documentation/manual/archetypes-developer-manual
        .. _UML: http://www.uml.org/
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        In practice, you draw your UML diagrams in a tool like ArgoUML_  which has the
        ability to generate XMI files. Once you are ready to test your
        product, you run *ArchGenXML* on the XMI file, which will generate the product
        directory. After generation, you will be able to install your product in Plone
        and have your new content types, tools and workflows available.
        
        .. _ArgoUML: http://argouml.tigris.org
        
        At present, round-trip support is not implemented: Custom code can't be
        converted back into XMI (and thus diagrams). However, you can re-generate
        your product over existing code. Method bodies and certain *protected* code
        sections will be preserved. This means that you can evolve your product's
        public interfaces, its methods and its attributes in the UML model, without
        fear of losing your hand-written code.
        
        Supported Plone Versions
        ========================
        
        We support Plone Versions 2.5.x and >3.1.x. But if you have code generated
        with some ArchGenXML version below 2 you will need to adjust the generated
        model and code manually. There is no smooth migration. If you dont need to make
        your code run on Plone 3, stick to an older version of ArchGenXML.
        
        Further Reading
        ===============
        
        The Manual_ documents most of ArchGenXML features. There are also plenty third
        party documentations in several languages. Just use Google_ to find more on
        this topic.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.5 (2010-09-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Extender doesn't generate interfaces twice anymore.
        [jensens]
        
        - You can now set meta_type="Subtractive Workflow" (default is "Workflow")
        and state_var="confidential_state" for example (default is "review_state")
        on a workflow to use it with collective.subtractiveworkflow.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Added roles and permissions protected sections in rolemap.xml.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Replaced buggy odict implementation by the ordereddict implementation
        available in Python 2.7.
        [moldy]
        
        - Unicode fixes for generated module info header.
        [moldy]
        
        - Removed DeprecationWarning about the sets module.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Header info: use better formatting for author.
        Encode module header strings so we don't choke on non-ASCII chars.
        [moldy]
        
        - Make "dependend_profiles" alternative as multi-tgv available
        (avoid ultra-long tgvs).
        [jensens]
        
        - Added virtual field type "keywords" which results in a LinesField with
        KeywordWidget (this needs a tgv catalog:index=1).
        [jensens]
        
        - Prevent error on empty tgv.
        [hpeteragitator]
        
        
        2.4.1 (2009-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix wrong version '2.4-'.
        '2.4-' version was not fully uploaded.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        2.4 (2009-04-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix use of index:extras tagged-value
        [jensens]
        
        - Enable easy plone.app.content.ATBlob subclassing.
        Add atblob stereotype to the profile.
        [jensens]
        
        - Add stripogram (available as egg) as dependency.
        [jensens]
        
        - Fix catalog assignment when catalogmultiples tagged valued is used.
