Building
========

Supported options
-----------------

The recipe supports the following options:

url
    URL for an archive containing the Squid sources. Either **url** or
    **svn** has to be specified.

svn
    URL for a subversion repository containing Aapache sources. Either **url**
    or **svn** has to be specified.

modules
    Here you you can specify the extra modules that you want apache to
    be compiled with. Each module goes in one line. The module names
    prepended with '--enable-' will be appended to the 'configure'
    command before compiling. For example, module 'ssl' becomes
    configure option '--enable-ssl'.

extra_options
    Since this recipe's 'build' entry-point subclasses zc.recipe.cmmi,
    we can pass other options to the 'configure' command, in addition
    to any 'modules' specified above. This allows you to specify
    non-module options like '--with-mpm=worker' or '--with-port=8888'.

Example usage
-------------

We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = apachebuild
    ...
    ... [apachebuild]
    ... recipe = plone.recipe.apache:build
    ... url = http://apache.multidist.com/httpd/httpd-2.2.10.tar.gz
    ... """ )

Running the buildout gives us::

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Installing apachebuild.
    apachebuild: Downloading apache tarball.
    apachebuild: Compiling Apache
    ...
