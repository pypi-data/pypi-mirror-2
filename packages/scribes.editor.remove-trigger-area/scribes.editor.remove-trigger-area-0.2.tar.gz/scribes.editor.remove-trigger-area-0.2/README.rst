Remove trigger area
===================

This funny quadrant in the window's corner confuses me. I can't imagine use cases for which
trigger area raises my productivity and user experience.

This extension leaves only shortcut (``<ctrl>+<alt>+m``) from original plugin to switch on Scribes
full view.
