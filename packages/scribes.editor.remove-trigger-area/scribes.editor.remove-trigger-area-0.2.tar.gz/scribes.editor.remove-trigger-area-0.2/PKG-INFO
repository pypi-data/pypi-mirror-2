Description: Remove trigger area
        ===================
        
        This funny quadrant in the window's corner confuses me. I can't imagine use cases for which
        trigger area raises my productivity and user experience.
        
        This extension leaves only shortcut (``<ctrl>+<alt>+m``) from original plugin to switch on Scribes
        full view.
