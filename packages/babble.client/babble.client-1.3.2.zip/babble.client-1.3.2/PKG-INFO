        Babble: Instant Messaging for Plone
        -----------------------------------
        
        Babble is an instant messaging service for Plone.
        It consists of babble.client as the Plone front-end client and
        `babble.server <http://plone.org/products/babble.server>`_,
        a Zope2 messaging service, as the backend chat service.
        
        The client consists of an *Online contacts* portlet with which you can initiate
        new chats. Chat sessions occur in modal dialog chatboxes and make use of
        JQuery Ajax polling to provide seamless, real-time messaging.
        During inactive periods, the polling interval gradually becomes longer until it
        reaches a specific (configurable) maximum polling interval.
        
        Communication between the client and server is achieved with JSON packets
        sent via XML-RPC.

        TODO:
        -----
        
        - Currently Javascript tests can't run anymore because of DTML,
        therefore, consider replacing dtml with collective.xrtresource.
        - Add broadcasting (send to all) functionality
        - Add tests for URL detection in messages
