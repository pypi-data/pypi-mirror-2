Description: =====
        HUMUS
        =====
        
        Humus is a tool to periodically backup chunks of data (e.g. database backups) to Amazon's S3.  Humus' features include:
        
        * CLI tool and Python library.
        * Automatic file rotation
        * Automatic date based file trimming.
        
        Why another S3 backup tool?
        ===========================
        
        Most of the backup tools out there were either foucused on backing up entire directories of files or didn't provide the rotation/trim tools I was looking for.
        
        
        Installation & Use
        ==================
        
        1. Run ``pip install humus``.
        2. Create a config file like the following at ``./humus.ini``, ``~/humus.ini``, ``/etc/humus.ini``, or ``/etc/humus/humus.ini``::
        
            [AWS]
            access_key=< YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY >
            secret_key=< YOUR AWS SECRET KEY >
            bucket=some-bucket-name
        
            # Everything after this point is optional
            path=bacups
        
            [humus]
            # The number of files to exist in the S3 directory before getting trimmed
            count_limit=2
            # The age in days where files should be trimmed
            age_limit=2
            # The chunk size in bytes for data to be passed to bz2
            chunk_size=1024
        
        3. Run the command ``humus my_filename target_file`` or ``output_cmd | humus my_filename`` whenever you want to make a new backup.
