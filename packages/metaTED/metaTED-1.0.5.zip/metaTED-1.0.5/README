metaTED is a tool that makes it easy to download all of the `TED talks`_. It
does so by creating over 8 `metalinks`_ of TED talks varying in both the
quality levels and possible talk groupings by directory. Features include:

    * Creates talks with informative file names - i.e.
      ``Unconventional Explanations/Hans Rosling on HIV - New facts and stunning data visuals.mp4``
      instead of original ``HansRosling_2009_480.mp4``.

    * Tries hard to get all of the talks, or at least most of them - with a good
      reason if some have failed.

    * More choice - creates one metalink per available quality level
      (currently low and high).

    * More choice - creates one metalink per available talk grouping, with all
      talks belonging to the same group placed inside a common directory. The
      possible talk groupings are extracted from talks metadata (currently
      filming/publishing year, talk theme and author).

    * Aggressive caching throughout the project, to avoid expensive network/CPU
      operations as much as possible. Proper cache invalidation included.

    * High levels of fault tolerance. 

    * Simple, yet powerful homegrown web crawler. 

    * Flexible and extensible software design with changes in mind.

    * Provides both the console script and a public API.

Downloading TED talks
=====================

If you just want to `download TED talks`_, you don't need to install this
package, or even Python. All you need to do is get a
`download client that supports the Metalink standard`_ and choose one of the
`daily updated metalinks`_.
