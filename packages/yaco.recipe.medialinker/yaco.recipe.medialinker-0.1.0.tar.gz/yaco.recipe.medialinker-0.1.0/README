yaco.recipe.medialinker
=======================

This is just a buildout recipe that creates symbolic links for media files in
Django projects.

The only needed option of the part that uses this recipe is the 'media-eggs',
which is a space separated list of eggs that contains media files.

Tests need to be written.

Use at your own risk.
