        Ygrep - Grep for Yaml files
        ===========================
        
        Ygrep is a simple utility that does a Grep-like match to Yaml files. It
        understands Yaml hierarchy and shows, for each match, the matching scalar
        node along with its descendants and ancestors, effectively cropping the yaml
        tree.
        
        For example, given the following Yaml tree::
        
            invoice: 34843
            date: 2001-01-23
            bill-to: &id001
              given: Chris
              family: Dumars
              address:
                lines: |
                  458 Walkman Dr.
                  Suite #292
                city: Royal Oak
                state: MI
                postal: 48046
        
        A match for "address" would write::
        
            bill-to:
              address:
                lines: |
