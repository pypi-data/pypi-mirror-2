        =====
        
        Snake is yet another Make-like tool, written on Python and inspired by Rake.
        
        
        Usage Example
        =============
        
        In a directory with ``snakefile.py`` containing such code::
        
            from snake.api import *
        
            @task
            def hello():
                print("Hello World!")
        
            task('default', deps=hello)
        
        one could run::
        
            $ snake hello
            Hello World!
        
        or (because ``default`` task is executed if no other task name was specified)::
        
            $ snake
            Hello World!
