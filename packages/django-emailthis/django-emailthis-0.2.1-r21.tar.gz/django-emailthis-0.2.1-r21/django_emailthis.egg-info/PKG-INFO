Description: 
        a simple email-to-a-friend application that generates an email
        form, handles its submission, persists the submission data to a
        database, and sends a templated email.  Both anonymous and registered
        users can send email.
        
        
        This app started out as a quasi-fork of Jeff Croft's "mailfriend" app
        (http://code.google.com/p/django-mailfriend/), but the latter only
        supported registered users; this supports users of both
        the registered and unregistered varieties.
        
        Form submission is here done solely via ajax; form loading is intended
        to be handled similarly.
