Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Allow local site managers to override portal_properties property sheets.  This setup will allow you to override just one property or all properties if you choose.
        
        The 0.x releases are a proof of concept, a rewrite may be in its future :)

        ----------------
        
        - Fix issue with the `text` property type.
          [claytron]
        
        - Added a new dependency on collective.autopermission.
          Added a new permission (collective.proxyproperties.ManageProperties).
          Gave the Manager role this new permission by default.
          Updated the proxyprops_edit view to require this new permission.
