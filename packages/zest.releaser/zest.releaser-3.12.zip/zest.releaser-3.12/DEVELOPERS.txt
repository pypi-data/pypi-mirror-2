Information for developers of zest.releaser
===========================================

Needed python
-------------

The tests currently pass on python 2.4.5, 2.5.4 and 2.6.3.  Using
2.6.2 specifically will give test failures.


Needed programs
---------------

To run the tests, you need to have the supported versioning systems
installed: svn, hg (mercurial) and git.  There may be test failures
when you have different versions of these programs.  In that case,
please investigate as these may be genuine errors.


Needed setuptools
-----------------

You also need setuptools or distribute in your system path.  This is
because we basically call 'sys.executable setup.py egg_info' directly
(in the tests and in the actual code), which will give an import error
on setuptools otherwise.  There is a branch with a hack that solves
this but it sounds too hacky.


Needed configuration
--------------------

For mercurial you may get test failures because of extra output like
this::

  No username found, using 'name@domain' instead.

To avoid this, create a file ~/.hgrc with something like this in it::

  [ui]
  username = Author Name <email@address.domain>

If you keep having problems, `Ubuntu explains it
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mercurial>`_ quite good.

For release testing we expected a functioning .pypirc file in your
home dir, with an old-style configuration, but the tests now use an
own config file.
