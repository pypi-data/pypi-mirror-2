Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A facade storage for Archetypes which delegates to 
        a Plone site's Memberdata Tool for storing content 
        item field values as memberdata properties. 
        
        This heavily relies on name magic.
        It is assumed that the correponding member and content 
        instances have corresponding ids. Correspondence is established
        with the help of ``Products.PlonePAS.utils.[de]cleanId`` - the
        same way Plone 4 uses to keep track of member folders. 
        
        The use case driving its development has been to support
        custom Archetypes-based content types which can be used
        as home folders for members and mirroring some of the
        member properties. That way, people can change member 
        properties by editing their home folder settings.
        
        ``archetypes.memberdata`` is used in production on http://www.incf.org.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        In your Archetypes schema definition you can use the ``MemberPropertyField``
        instead of a regular StringField to get and set the field's value in a
        corresponding member property. Per default, a property with the same
        name as the field is used unless the ``member_property_id`` is set to point
        to a different property.
        
        For other field types one can use ``MemberdataStorage`` as well as long as
        the data type can be handled by the member data tool.
