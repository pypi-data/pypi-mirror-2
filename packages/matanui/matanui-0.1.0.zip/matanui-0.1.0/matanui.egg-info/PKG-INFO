Description: 
        MataNui is intending to provide a data serving platform for the Grid that
        can replicate between various sites, store/query arbitrary amounts of
        meta-data, and is interfaced with a RESTful web service. The concept also
        allows for an alternative server front end using the Griffin GridFTP server.
        The concept is (initially) based on storing all data/meta-data in the GridFS
        mode of the MongoDB NoSQL database. This code consists of a WSGI based
        RESTful web service that interfaces directly with the MongoDB, and can be
        used together with Apache and mod_wsgi.
        
        The MataNui project is resulting from the ambitions of the New Zealand
        BeSTGRID project (https://bestgrid.org/) to provide a reliable and easy to
        use "Data Fabric" for the Globus Toolkit based Grid. The implementation is
        also aligned with the ambitions of the Australian Research Collaboration
        Service ARCS (http://www.arcs.org.au/).
        
        The project has been outlines at the New Zealand eResearch Symposium 2010 in
        Auckland on this poster:
