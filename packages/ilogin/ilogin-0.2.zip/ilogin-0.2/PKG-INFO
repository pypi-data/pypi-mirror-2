        iLogin
        ======
        ilogin is a single sign-on script (SSO) that allows you to generate passwords
        for each online service you're using.
        
        This way you will have different passwords for each service and you don't have
        to remember them as you'll be able to obtain each every time you want
        to login to your service.

        Install
        =======
        
            ::
        
                $: easy_install ilogin
                $: python setup.py install
        
        
        How it works?
        =============
        First time when you'll run this script, you'll be asked for the new password in
        order to initialize the database::
        
            $: ilogin
            New password: MYSECRETPASSWORD
        
        Remember this password as it will be used to login to database and to generate
        passwords for your services. There is no possible way to recover this password.
        If you lose it you'll have to reset all your online services passwords.
        
        Add a service that you want to use with this script::
        
            $: ilogin add
            Service: google
        
        Get a login for your service::
        
            $: ilogin
            Service: google
            Password: MYSECRETPASSWORD
            3dsad3425
        
        Now go to google.com > Change password and update your password with the one
        provided by this script: 3dsad3425
        
        For now one, every time you want to login to google, run ilogin and
        copy&paste generated password within gooogle.com Password field::
        
            $: ilogin
            Service: google
            Password: MYSECRETPASSWORD
            3dsad3425
        
        You can also auto copy password to clipboard (UNIX and OS X)::
        
            $: ilogin copy
            Service: google
            Password: MYSECRETPASSWORD
            Password copied to clipboard
