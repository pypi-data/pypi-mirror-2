GuessIt
=======

GuessIt is a python library that tries to extract as much information as
possible from a filename.

GuessIt works with video files, both movies and tv shows episodes.

Currently, GuessIt only extract information from the filename, but it could very
well be in the future that it uses some other libraries to extract information
from the video metadata itself (ie: codec, bitrate, etc...)
