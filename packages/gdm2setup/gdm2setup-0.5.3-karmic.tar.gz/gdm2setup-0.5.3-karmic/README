GDM2 Setup utility

A simple setup utility for the new GDM2 included in Karmic Ubuntu. GDM2Setup allows the user to set login wallpaper, select automatic login or prompted, user list or input box login, and much more. This application's goal is to put the older GDM setup utility functionality back into Ubuntu and other Gnome based Linux distributions.
