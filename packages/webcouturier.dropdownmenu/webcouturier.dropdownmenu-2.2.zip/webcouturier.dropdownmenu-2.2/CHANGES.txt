  [spliter]

  [spliter]

  it's used to get the object instead of trying to reconstruct it 
  from the url which fails in many cases.
  [fschulze]

  "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'endswith'" error
  [spliter]

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1.3
-------------------------------

- Switched the package from using browser resource for the main

  better
  [spliter]

  [spliter]
  
- Fixed the problem with images in the site's root
  [spliter]      

- Only override the depth for navtree queries for the dropdown menus.
  The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
  break for sites with a different navigation root.
  [wichert]

- Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
  removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
  properly.
  [wichert]

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1

- Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one

  depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.
  [spliter]

  with webstats.js file
