Description: ====================
        Supervisor wildcards
        ====================
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        Adds ``mstop``, ``mstart`` and ``mrestart`` commands to Supervisor_. Those commands works exacatly the same way as ``stop``, ``start`` and ``restart`` respectively, except they support process name wildcarding.
        
        In some usecases you can use groups support in Supervisor_, but it doesn't allow you to have one process in multiple groups. That's when wildcarding can be realy useful.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        ::
        
          supervisor> status
          celery-a                                RUNNING    pid 15085, uptime 0:00:11
          celery-b                                RUNNING    pid 15086, uptime 0:00:12
          gunicorn-a                              RUNNING    pid 14151, uptime 0:05:18
          gunicorn-b                              RUNNING    pid 14237, uptime 0:04:45
