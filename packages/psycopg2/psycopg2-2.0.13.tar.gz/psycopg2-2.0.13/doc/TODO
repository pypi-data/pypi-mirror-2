TODO list for psycopg 2 or later
********************************

Move items to the DONE section only after writing a test for the
implementation. Also add a note on how the item was resolved.
(Obviously I was joking about the test..)

* Find a better way to compile the type-casting code instead of including it
   in typecast.c directy. (Including is not that bad, but the need to touch
   psycopg/typecast.c every time is bad bad bad.)

* executemany() should _not_ take the async flag, remove it and force multiple
   queries to be synchronous.

* Fix all the docstrings.

* Support the protocols API fully.

* Unify the common code in typecast_datetime.c and typecast_mxdatetime.c.

* Port typecasters to new-style classes.

* Write a complete postgresql<->python encodings table.

* Implement binary typecasters (should be easy, but it will take time.)

DONE
====

* Convert type-casters to new-style types in Python 2.2+.

* callproc() never worked, fix it or remove it and raise right exception.
   [Removed callproc code, now an exception is raised.]
