psycopg and the GPL
===================

psycopg is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version. See file COPYING for details.

As a special exception, specific permission is granted for the GPLed
code in this distribition to be linked to OpenSSL and PostgreSQL libpq
without invoking GPL clause 2(b).

Note that the GPL was chosen to avoid proprietary adapters based on
psycopg code. Using psycopg in a proprietary product (even bundling
psycopg with the proprietary product) is fine as long as:

 1. psycopg is called from Python only using only the provided API
    (i.e., no linking with C code and no C modules based on it); and

 2. all the other points of the GPL are respected (you offer a copy
    of psycopg's source code, and so on.)

Alternative licenses
====================

If you prefer you can use the Zope Database Adapter ZPsycopgDA (i.e.,
every file inside the ZPsycopgDA directory) user the ZPL license as
published on the Zope web site, http://www.zope.org/Resources/ZPL.

Also, the following BSD-like license applies (at your option) to the
files following the pattern psycopg/adapter*.{h,c} and
psycopg/microprotocol*.{h,c}:

 Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
 including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
 freely, subject to the following restrictions:

 1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
    claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this
    software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation
    would be appreciated but is not required.
 
 2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not
    be misrepresented as being the original software.
 
 3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.

psycopg is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

Proprietary licenses
====================

A non-exclusive license is available for companies that want to include
psycopg in their proprietary products without respecting the spirit of the
GPL. The price of the license is one day of development done by the author,
at the consulting fee he applies to his usual customers at the day of the
request.
