Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This package adds a new tab to ``portal_skins/custom`` folder named "FS-Export".
        Using this tab you can export all scripts and other stuff you have customized
        with one click to the filesystem. Now also with support for
        portal_view_customizations folder.
        
        Even in times of views, content providers and viewlets there are cases where
        you have stuff in custom folder and struggle with exporting it to the
        filesystem.
