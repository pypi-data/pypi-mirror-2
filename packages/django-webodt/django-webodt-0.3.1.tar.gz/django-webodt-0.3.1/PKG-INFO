Description: **django-webodt** is a django module which aims to create documents in various
        formats from Open Document templates (odt). Django-webodt supports virtually
        all formats supported by chosen backend tool. We have positive experience of
        creating PDF, HTML, RTF and MS Word (.doc) documents.
        
        Document conversion is performed with help of external tools, each of which is
        served by its own backend. Currently there are three built-in backends:
        
        - **ooffice**: performs format conversion using big and fat OpenOffice.
          Especially suitable for documents with complicated formatting, where all
          other backends can fail. OpenOffice should be launched as daemon before.
        - **abiword**: relatively lightweight converter which uses abiword as
          converting engine.  Best choice for those who have restricted amount of
          resources and/or don't want to worry about daemon launching.
        - **googledocs**: uses free service from Google, the only possible variant for
          shared-hosting users or users with limited amount of resources who don't care
          much about their privacy.
