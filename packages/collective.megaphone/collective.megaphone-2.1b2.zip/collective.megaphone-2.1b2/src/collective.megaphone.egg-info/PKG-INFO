Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Megaphone makes it easy to build powerful online advocacy campaigns in Plone.
        
        Letters to decision makers
        --------------------------
         * Collect arbitrary fields
         * Required and optional recipients
         * Save data locally
         * Save data to Salesforce.com (requires salesforcepfgadapter)
         * E-mail template-based letters to targets
         * Customizable thank-you letter to sender
        
        Petitions
        ---------
         * Collect arbitrary fields
         * Save data locally
         * Save data to Salesforce.com (requires salesforcepfgadapter)
         * List signatures within your Plone site
         * Customizable thank-you letter to sender
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        No product is perfect. There are some important things Megaphone doesn't do
        (yet), including:
        
         * Matching of users to targets based on postal address
         * Delivery to targets who don't have a publicly-accessible email address
        
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        Megaphone builds on top of several fantastic Plone products to do its work
        without reinventing the wheel.
        
         * The heart of Megaphone is `PloneFormGen`_, which provides the core
           form-handling capabilities.
         * Because Megaphone actions are a fairly complicated PloneFormGens with lots of
           defaults, we've built `collective.z3cform.wizard`_ which lets us make a very
           user-friendly wizard for building out the advocacy letter. The wizard
           can be run and then re-run to let a user change the settings. More advanced
           users can directly edit the PloneFormGen fields and objects to create more
           complex setups.
         * Salesforce integration is via the `Salesforce PFG Adapter`_ and the
           underlying `Salesforce Base Connector`_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Megaphone has been tested with Plone 3.3 and Plone 4.
        
        Adding to buildout
        ------------------
        
        Megaphone has several dependencies. These should get pulled in automatically
        if you add the collective.megaphone egg to your buildout.  _However_, you need
        to make sure that you get versions of the dependencies that are compatible with
        your version of Plone. To do so, you may extend the following known good sets
        of version pins:
        
        For Plone 4::
        
          [buildout]
          extends = http://good-py.appspot.com/release/collective.megaphone/2.0?plone=4.0.1
          
          [instance]
          ...
          eggs =
              ...
              collective.megaphone
        
        For Plone 3::
          
          [buildout]
          extends = http://good-py.appspot.com/release/collective.megaphone/2.0?zope=2.10.x
          
          [instance]
          ...
          eggs =
              ...
              collective.megaphone
        
        Of course, you may need to adjust the specified Plone version, or create a
        derivative set of version pins if the ones in this set conflict with those
        recommended for some other add-on.
        
        Activating the add-on
        ---------------------
        
        After running buildout and starting your Zope instance, install
        collective.megaphone via the Add/Remove Products configlet in Plone Site Setup.
        
        Now you should be able to add an 'Action Letter' via the add item menu.
        
        Make sure that you configure your Plone site's e-mail settings before trying
        to send a letter.
        
        Salesforce export
        -----------------
        
        In order to create a letter that saves contact information to Salesforce, you
        must install the Products.salesforcepfgadapter and
        Products.salesforcebaseconnector eggs.
        
        CAPTCHA support
        ---------------
        
        In order to include CAPTCHA fields, you must also install the
        collective.captcha or collective.recaptcha egg, and load its ZCML.
        
        If using collective.recaptcha, you must also configure your recaptcha keys via
        the /@@recaptcha-settings view.
        
        Upgrading
        =========
        
        If you have a previous version of Megaphone already installed, update your
        buildout as described above. (Make sure you have a backup first!)
        
        Then start your Zope instance, go to the Add/Remove Products configlet in Plone
        Site Setup, and find the button to upgrade Megaphone.
        
        Megaphone will also automatically update its dependencies plone.app.jquerytools
        and plone.app.z3cform to compatible versions.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.1b2 (2010-11-16)
        ------------------
        
        * Added a way to provide additional template variables by implementing an
          IVariableProvider adapter.
          [davisagli]
        
        2.1b1 (2010-10-14)
        ------------------
        
        * Raise AT ObjectInitializedEvent and ObjectEditedEvent when the wizard is finished.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Updated the test setup to use a layer so that it can be extended by Megaphone
          plugins more easily.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Added an upgrade step to remove the old "optional-recipients" field which is
          no longer needed.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Revamped the UI of the recipients wizard step.  Recipient settings are now
          configured in an overlay.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Introduced the concept of pluggable "recipient sources".  Each recipient source
          has its own settings, can provide content for the Megaphone form, and is queried
          for recipients when the form is submitted.  The old recipient functionality
          (with "required" and "optional" recipients) has been refactored into the "standard"
          recipient source.
          [davisagli]
        
        2.0 (2010-10-14)
        ----------------
        
        * Render the signatures portlet when sig_portlet_min_count is not set.
          [khink]
        
        * Removed reference to "letter" from the default thank you message so that
          it makes sense for a petition too.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Moved helper functions into the utils module.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Only show "latest signatures" text in portlet if there are signatures to
          show.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        * Refer to "offline signature count" instead of "goose factor".
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        * Fix upgrade step for Plone 3 -> Plone 4 to only run for sites that have
          Megaphone installed.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        2.0b1 (2010-08-19)
        ------------------
        
        * Move the main e-mail switch to the recipients wizard step, and rename the
          delivery step to salesforce since that's all it covers now.  Make it only
          show up if Salesforce support is installed.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Added a permission to control who can view signatures.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Don't display the Intro page of the wizard when returning to edit an existing
          Megaphone Action.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Updated to new collective.z3cform.wizard with various fixes.
          [davisagli]
        
        * In Plone 3, use the overlay styles from plone.app.jquerytools>=1.1.1, rather
          than supplying our own.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Including a savedata adapter is no longer optional.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Removed the old signers count portlet and replaced it with the new one
          which lists recent signers.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Added wizard step for configuring display of signers in a portlet.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Added petitions as a new type of action. Different options are available
          depending on whether you select letter or petition on the first page of
          the Megaphone Action wizard. Petitions also get a modified set of default
          form fields.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Renamed the "Action Letter" type to "Megaphone Action". An upgrade step
          must be run to update existing sites.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Refactored test setup.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Removed duplicate version number in version.txt
          [davisagli]
        
        1.4 (2010-06-30)
        ----------------
        
        * Fix table styling in Plone 4 Sunburst theme.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Reimplement field reordering using HTML5 drag-and-drop to avoid Jquery UI
          dependency.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.3 (2010-05-21)
        ----------------
        
        * Add 'Send' button to send the letter immediately without Preview.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fix issue with preview popup fallback for when Javascript is disabled.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.2 (2010-03-02)
        ----------------
        
        * Fix issue where sender for the thank you e-mail was not properly loaded
          when editing the form after initial creation.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Added option to disable thank you e-mail to activist.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fix wizard step listing styles for Plone 4.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Make sure that the Next button takes precedence when submitting a wizard
          step by pressing enter, rather than Previous.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Make sure the list of template variables can't obscure the Prev/Next
          buttons.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Increase the height of the default field for text fields in the form field
          wizard step.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fix regression from 1.1, wherein text fields would get transformed to HTML
          and then erroneously escaped.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.1 (2010-02-18)
        ----------------
        
        * Make sure collective.jqueryui's ZCML is loaded.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Added custom import handler to set the add_view_expr on the Action Letter
          FTI in Plone 4. Also an update step to add this when upgrading from Plone
          3 to Plone 4.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Workaround for change in the utranslate function in Plone 4 (or possibly
          just me misusing it before).
          [davisagli]
        
        * Workaround for Zope interface changes in the Plone 4-compatible version of
          PloneFormGen.
          [davisagli]
        
        * When creating Leads in Salesforce, default to setting the Lead Source to
          'Web'. (Requires salesforcepfgadpater >= 1.6b2).
          [davisagli]
        
        * Use the htmlValue method of form fields to process the values in the request
          before rendering a letter.  This makes it possible to set the values that
          will be displayed for a boolean field, for example.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0 (2009-11-11)
        ----------------
        
        * No longer artificially restrict to z3c.form <2.0, as that is a deployment
          decision.  Plone 3 users may need to pin z3c.form to version 1.9.0 or add
          additional fake eggs to avoid pulling in new zope.* packages.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Only depend on plone.app.jquerytools, not Products.pipbox.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed issue with loading thank you page text when revisiting the wizard.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0rc1 (2009-8-26)
        ------------------
        
        * Added options for configuring the thank you page message or an alternative
          thank you page URL.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed portlet link to view saved letters.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Decode request variables before using them in dollarString substitutions,
          to avoid UnicodeDecodeErrors when casting the strings for interpolation.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Decode UTF-8 values from Archetypes before passing them to z3c.form, to
          avoid UnicodeDecodeErrors when the system default encoding is ASCII.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Check the persistent template setting in the formgen_tool when determining
          whether to update the mailer templates, rather than the default
          default from PFG's config.py
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed issue with marshalling field size.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed action adapter processing on the final send step when a CAPTCHA field
          is in use.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0a1 (2009-06-25)
        ------------------
        
        * Initial release.
