Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Megaphone makes it easy to build powerful online advocacy campaigns in Plone.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Letters to decision makers
        * Required and optional recipients
        * Save data locally
        * Save data to Salesforce.com (requires salesforcepfgadapter)
        * Email letters to targets
        * Customizable thank-you letter to sender
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        No product is perfect. There are some important things Megaphone doesn't do
        (yet), including:
        
        * Matching of users to targets based on postal address
        * Delivery to targets who don't have a publicly-accessible email address
        
        Coming soon
        -----------
        
        Megaphone is still under development, and there are quite a few features we've
        got in progress, but are not released yet. Highlights include:
        
        * Advocacy petitions with public display of results
        
        You can view our full `development tracker`_.

        How it works
        ============
        
        Megaphone builds on top of several fantastic Plone products to do its work
        without reinventing the wheel.
        
        * The heart of Megaphone is `PloneFormGen`_, which provides the core
        form-handling capabilities.
        * Because advocacy letter is a fairly complicated PloneFormGen with lots of
        defaults, we've built `collective.z3cform.wizard`_ which lets us make a very
        user-friendly wizard for building out the advocacy letter. The wizard
        can be run and then re-run to let a user change the settings. More advanced
        users can directly edit the PloneFormGen fields and objects to create more
        complex setups.
        * Salesforce integration is via the `Salesforce PFG Adapter`_ and the
        underlying `Salesforce Base Connector`_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Megaphone has been tested with Plone 3.2 and 3.3, and should be installed using
        buildout in order to include the needed dependencies.  Support for Plone 4
        is on its way, but is waiting for releases of a few key dependencies.
        
        Simply add collective.megaphone to the list of eggs for your instance.  If
        using Plone <3.3, you must also load its zcml.
        
        After running buildout and starting your Zope instance, install
        collective.megaphone via the Add/Remove Products configlet or
        portal_quickinstaller.
        
        Now you should be able to add an 'Action Letter' via the add item menu.
        
        Make sure that you configure your Plone site's e-mail settings before trying
        to send a letter.
        
        Salesforce export
        -----------------
        
        In order to create a letter that saves contact information to Salesforce, you
        must install the Products.salesforcepfgadapter and
        Products.salesforcebaseconnector eggs.
        
        CAPTCHA support
        ---------------
        
        In order to include CAPTCHA fields, you must also install the
        collective.captcha or collective.recaptcha egg, and load its ZCML.
        
        If using collective.recaptcha, you must also configure your recaptcha keys via
        the /@@recaptcha-settings view.

        when editing the form after initial creation.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Added option to disable thank you e-mail to activist.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fix wizard step listing styles for Plone 4.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Make sure that the Next button takes precedence when submitting a wizard
        step by pressing enter, rather than Previous.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Make sure the list of template variables can't obscure the Prev/Next
        buttons.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Increase the height of the default field for text fields in the form field
        wizard step.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fix regression from 1.1, wherein text fields would get transformed to HTML
        and then erroneously escaped.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.1 (2010-02-18)
        ----------------
        
        * Make sure collective.jqueryui's ZCML is loaded.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Added custom import handler to set the add_view_expr on the Action Letter
        FTI in Plone 4. Also an update step to add this when upgrading from Plone
        3 to Plone 4.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Workaround for change in the utranslate function in Plone 4 (or possibly
        just me misusing it before).
        [davisagli]
        
        * Workaround for Zope interface changes in the Plone 4-compatible version of
        PloneFormGen.
        [davisagli]
        
        * When creating Leads in Salesforce, default to setting the Lead Source to
        'Web'. (Requires salesforcepfgadpater >= 1.6b2).
        [davisagli]
        
        * Use the htmlValue method of form fields to process the values in the request
        before rendering a letter.  This makes it possible to set the values that
        will be displayed for a boolean field, for example.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.0 (2009-11-11)
        ----------------
        
        * No longer artificially restrict to z3c.form <2.0, as that is a deployment
        decision.  Plone 3 users may need to pin z3c.form to version 1.9.0 or add
        additional fake eggs to avoid pulling in new zope.* packages.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Only depend on plone.app.jquerytools, not Products.pipbox.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed issue with loading thank you page text when revisiting the wizard.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.0rc1 (2009-8-26)
        ------------------
        
        * Added options for configuring the thank you page message or an alternative
        thank you page URL.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed portlet link to view saved letters.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Decode request variables before using them in dollarString substitutions,
        to avoid UnicodeDecodeErrors when casting the strings for interpolation.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Decode UTF-8 values from Archetypes before passing them to z3c.form, to
        avoid UnicodeDecodeErrors when the system default encoding is ASCII.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Check the persistent template setting in the formgen_tool when determining
        whether to update the mailer templates, rather than the default
        default from PFG's config.py
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed issue with marshalling field size.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fixed action adapter processing on the final send step when a CAPTCHA field
        is in use.
