Description: 
        This is a "bootstrap" package that is used to generate new deployments
        of the OpenCore software stack, the web-based group collaboration
        toolkit that powers `coactivate.org <http://www.coactivate.org/>`_ and
        other websites.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        This package provides two commands for bootstrapping an OpenCore site
        installation:
        
        * ``new-opencore-site`` will create a directory structure useful for
        managing an ongoing OpenCore site deployment.  Run this once, when
        you are first deploying your OpenCore site.
        
        It will place a file `opencore.conf` in the generated directory.
        You can edit the configuration in this file; it will be used by
        the ``rebuild-opencore`` command to determine what profile to
        build by default; what portset to configure the stack on; and
        other build parameters that are useful to manage on a per-site basis.
        
        * ``rebuild-opencore-site`` will initiate a new Fassembler build for your
        OpenCore site, using your desired configuration.
        
        A third command is provided as well:
        
        * ``new-opencore-site-config`` will print a site configuration TEMPLATE
        to stdout. If you have a site layout already created by OpenplansBoot
        this may be useful for quickly generating a configuration that can be
        used with ``rebuild-opencore-site``.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        The ``profile_url`` and ``default_profile_url`` can now be specified
        as svn://, svn+ssh://, and file:// URLs also.  Previously the only
        options were http://, https:// and relative paths (which are treated
        as suffixes against https://svn.openplans.org/svn/build/requirements)
        
        Update location of default requirement profile to svn.socialplanning.org
        instead of svn.openplans.org
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        Prepend file:// to etc_svn_repo if no protocol is specified.
        
        Fix bug in newbuild.sh script, where it looks for "fassembler-req.txt",
        which was failing when using a relative requirements profile
        directory rather than an absolute path.
        
        Check that a ``builds`` directory exists under ``base_dir`` before
        running newbuild.sh
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        Add an optional parameter num_extra_zopes which, if set, will
        cause N extra zope instances to be installed at the end of the build.
        
        Requires fassembler>=0.5 (0.4 which added the ``extrazope`` project
        and 0.5 which added the ``num_extra_zopes`` setting);
        opencore-fassembler_projects>=0.3 which now respects the
        ``num_extra_zopes`` setting when building the frontend; and
        libopencore>=0.4 which allows load-balanced proxying to a set of zope
        servers.
        
        0.4.1
        -----
        
        Fixed typo in in-process docs.
        
        0.4
        ---
        
        Removed fassembler_projects parameter. Instead, the bootstrap script now looks for
        a file "fassembler-req.txt" in the profile directory to be built, since profiles
        should manage their own requirements.
        
        0.3.2
        -----
        
        Renamed ``rebuild-opencore`` -> ``rebuild-opencore-site``
        
        Added ``new-opencore-site-config`` command that simply prints the config
        template to stdout (useful for existing deployment structures)
        
        0.3.1
        -----
        
        Passing profile_url as a positional arg was broken.  It works now.
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        New package opencore-fassembler_boot, based on OpenplansBoot.
        
        Redesigned to use configuration files managed per-site, and to make the newbuild.sh script non-public.
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        - Remove --use-plone3 as an option; obsoleted by default-build.ini
