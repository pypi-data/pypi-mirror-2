Version 0.1.1a  2010-11-14
    Many changes since the initial release:
    * The project has a home page outside of PyPI:
      http://code.google.com/p/pycalcstats/
    * stats is now aimed at Python 3.1 or better. Support functions for
      older versions have been removed.
    * Many more statistics functions.
    * Tests are now worthy of the name.
    * Serious numerical instability in variance and standard deviation
      due to use of a naive algorithm has been corrected. (Thanks to Kurt
      Smith for spotting this).
    * I now know more about quartiles than I ever hoped to learn :(

    Known issues:
    * This is still alpha software. The API is not yet locked down: function
      signatures or even names may still change.
    * Many more tests are required. Test coverage is good, but incomplete.
    * Multivariate functions including cov, corr and linr are still painfully
      naive and need work.
    * Better documentation, including executable examples.
    * Quantile-related functions are split off into a private module, but
      without the full package structure. I'm not sure this is the right way
      to do it.
    * Not all quartile/quantile modes are supported yet, or fully debugged.
    * Windows binary installer appears to be broken.

    Thanks also to Geremy Condra for his efforts.
