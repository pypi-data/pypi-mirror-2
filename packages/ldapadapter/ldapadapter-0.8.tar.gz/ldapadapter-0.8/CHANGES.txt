ldapadapter changes
===================

0.8 (2011-01-25)
================

* Update to work with ZTK.

* Newer version of openldap installed for testing purposes.

* The UI stuff in ldapadapter.browser is now deprecrated. Should you
  still need it, ZCML include ldapadapter.browser's ``configure.zcml``
  manually; it is not pulled in automatically anymore.

* Remove some old installation cruft.

* zest.releaser support in buildout.

0.7 - 04.07.2008
================

* Encoding DNs to UTF-8 when connecting.

* Removed help:register directive for Grok 0.13 compatability.

0.6 - 20.11.2006
================

Features added
--------------

* Fixed Zope 3.3 induced deprecation warnings.

Bugs fixed
----------

* The LDAP Adapter Vocabulary list (used by ldappas) was showing an
  enormous list of irrelevant things. Instead only show those
  LDAPAdapters that were registered. Note: each ldapadapter must be
  registered with a particular *name* for it to show up properly in
  the user interface of ldappas now...
