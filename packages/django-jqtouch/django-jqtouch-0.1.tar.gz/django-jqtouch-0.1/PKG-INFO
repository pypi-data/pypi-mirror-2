Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        `jQTouch <http://www.jqtouch.com/>`_ is a `jQuery <http://jquery.com/>`_  based
        library for touch/mobile web applications. ``django-jqtouch`` builds on jQTouch 
        to provide easier content management with Django. ``django-jqtouch`` adds a 
        model for creating individually displayed screens or panels. When rendering, 
        the contents of the panel is inspected and other referenced panels are 
        rendered as well in order to combine the content and provide a more seamless 
        experience.
        
        Panels
        ------
        
        The ``Panel`` model consists of a unique identifier, the body of the panel, and 
        a flag for whether the panel can be embedded or should be loaded with an 
        XMLHttpRequest when requested by the user.
        
        Recursive Rendering
        -------------------
        
        When rendering, the body of the panel is searched for anchor tags. Each anchor 
        destination is checked to see if it is a local URL. If it is a local URL, the 
        configurable list of panel resolvers is checked in order to see if it resolves 
        to a panel. If the panel can be embedded, the ``render`` method on the panel is 
        called and the results are included as a sibling in the output of the current 
        panel.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        #. Install the ``django-jqtouch`` package in your preferred method: easy_install, 
           setup.py install, pip or buildout.
        #. Add ``jqtouch`` to the list of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your settings file
        #. Include ``jqtouch.urls`` in your project's url patterns::
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                (r'', include('jqtouch.urls')),
            )
        
        Additional Settings
        -------------------
        
        ``JQTOUCH_BASE_IDENTIFIER``
            Default ``default``. This is the identifier to use with the default URL when
            using the ``jqtouch.urls`` include. Requesting '/' will load this panel 
            identifier.
        
        ``JQTOUCH_PANEL_RESOLVERS``
            Default ``('jqtouch.resolvers.panel_model_resolver',)``. A list or tuple of 
            panel resolving functions in the order they should be tried. Strings can be 
            used to specify the resolving function or the actual functions can be entered.
