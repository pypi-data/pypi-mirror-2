Pesto is a library for Python web applications. Its aim is to make writing WSGI
web applications easy and fun. Pesto doesn't constrain you -- how you integrate
with databases, what templating system you use or how you prefer to lay out
your source files is up to you. Above all, pesto is small, well documented and
well tested.

Pesto makes it easy to:

    - Map any URI to any part of your application.
    - Produce unicode aware, standards compliant WSGI applications.
    - Interrogate WSGI request information -- form variables and HTTP request headers.
    - Create and manipulate HTTP headers, redirects, cookies etc.
    - Integrate with any other WSGI application or middleware, giving you
      access to a vast and growing resource.
