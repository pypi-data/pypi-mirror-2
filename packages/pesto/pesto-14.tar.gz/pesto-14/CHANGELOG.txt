Version 14

  * FileSessionManager now saves files under dedicated _pesto_sessions
    subdirectory, making it safer to use when initialized on a shared temporary
    directory.

  * Corrected pesto.wsgiutils.mount_app, which previously passed a reference to
    an out of date request object to sub apps

  * Altered the url() function acquired by dispatcher_app decorated functions
    to allow script_name, netloc and URL scheme to be specified, making it
    possible for multiple Pesto dispatcher_apps mounted at different paths or
    network locations to generate valid URLs for each other.

  * pesto.wsgiutils.with_request_args now raises error objects that may be
    more easily separated out from other errors in middleware layers if required.

  * Session.save() now forces a save even if no changes have been
    detected (which may happen if you store mutable objects in the session)

  * pesto.wsgiutils.with_request_args now raises exceptions generated
    when parsing arguments from request data. This behaviour is generally more
    useful to developers than an error page with no information about what
    parameter is missing.

Version 13

  * Added HttpOnly option to cookies

  * Session middleware can now have the cookie path and domain overridden

Version 12

  * Added a path_info argument to request.make_uri

  * Improved support for dispatcher_app to dispatch to bound methods

  * Added many missing docstrings and other pylint/cheesecake suggested changes

  * Extended request.make_uri to take any query argument that wsgiutils.make_query will accept

  * make_query now supports taking a list of (name, value) tuples

Version 11

  * Removed dbm and rdbms session managers, these were untested, undocumented and were not recommended for use.

  * Added fix for parse_querystring when qs is empty

  * Fixed error on non-UTF8 encoded request body

  * Added X-Pesto-Exception header to help debugging of webapps

  * Improved dispatch debug logging

  * Fixed issue when using dispatcher predicates and caching

  * Reversed dispatcher function matching precedence: the first matching function wins

  * Remove pesto.wsgiutils.MockWSGI and replace with classes in a new pesto.testing module

  * Added a decorators argument to dispatcher_app.match, allowing handler functions to have decorators which are only applied in the context of web requests

  * Request.cookies is now a MultiDict object with the same API as Request.form, Request.files and Request.query

  * Renamed urldispatcher to dispatcher_app to clarify intent of this class.

  * Made response.Response normalize header case and sort headers on ingress, fixing a few consistency issues.

  * Adjusted response header handling to be standards compliant on 304 responses and ETag headers

  * Use wsgiref.validator in MockWSGI

  * Refactored some parts of request.py and wsgiutils.py into new httputils.py and
    utils.py modules.

  * Removed dependency on stdlib cgi.py (see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2009-May/003822.html for reasons).

  * Changed variables named 'encoding' to 'charset' to make the naming more consistent with HTTP.

  * Removed support for Python 2.3. From now on pesto is actively tested on 2.5 and 2.6, and I will try to support 2.4 if bugs are reported.


Version 10

  * Fixes in documentation and packaging, but no changes to functionality


Version 9

  * Added a predicate argument to dispatcher.match, allowing for extra arbitrary checks before routing a URL.

  * Add basic ETag support

  * Removed http exceptions

  * Added support for wsigorg.routing_args

  * WSGI apps created with pesto now have execution deferred until the first
    iteration. Therefore the iterator's .close method can be used to reliably
    release resources etc.

  * Fix for Response objects not catching close methods on upstream content iterators

  * Added onclose kwarg for Response object. Any functions in onclose will be called on the wsgi close event.

  * Added request.files object to complement request.form and request.query

  * Added MultiDict object to replace FieldStorageWrapper

  * Renamed register_pattern to register_converter for consistency

  * Allowed multiple close functions to be passed to ClosingIterator

  * request.make_uri now uri quotes paths

  * Rewrote urldispatcher to use a much more flexible URL matching syntax

  * Refactored Request initialisation to ensure that multiple calls don't
    attempt to reinitialize request parameters

  * added Response.getheaders, Response.getheader and Response.from_wsgi

  * add an ExtensiblePattern to dispatcher and enable it by default

  * Changed dispatcher to be a WSGI callable

  * Added wsgiutils.ClosingIterator and wsgiutils.overlay

  * Pesto response objects are now valid WSGI apps

  * Ensure the same Request instance is returned when called multiple times on the same environ object

  * Added a function for mapping request form parameters to function arguments

  * Updated documentation: now requires sphinx for building docs

  * Renamed WSGIRequest to Request for consistency with Response

  * Changed 'despatcher' to 'dispatcher' throughout, after it was pointed out that no one spells it this way any more


Version 8

  * Merged pesto.utils with pesto.wsgiutils

  * Refactored builtin static server to allow it to be used to serve ad-hoc single files

  * Added a make_query utility function to wsgiutils

  * Fixed request.make_uri when presented with a relative URI. expanded the docstring and tests.

  * Static server fixes for windows environments


Version 7

  * Reimplemented session saving machinery using the WSGI standard close() mechanism.

  * Request.FieldStorageWrapper now raises a KeyError on non-existant item access


Version 6

  * Added uri_join and fixed request.make_uri path concatenation logic

  * Moved debug param out of despatch class and into despatcher_app, where it can be applied across all despatchers in operation

  * Removed duplicate default charset/encoding setting

  * Added Response.bad_request() classmethod

  * Added Response.buffered method

  * Added Response.add_cookie


Version 5

  * Changed wsgiutils.make_absolute_url to bring into line with PEP 333 and improve handling of relative URIs

  * Added Response.redirect, Response.not_found etc classmethods, replacing previous freestanding functions

  * make_query now allows a separator character to be specified

  * pesto.currentrequest() returns None when no request available

  * Add WSGIRequest.query to model querystring data. Both WSGIRequest.form and .query are now properties and lazily instantiated.


Version 4

  * First publicly released version!
