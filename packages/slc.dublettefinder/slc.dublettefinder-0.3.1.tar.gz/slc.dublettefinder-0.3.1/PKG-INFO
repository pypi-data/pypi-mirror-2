Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        slc.dublettefinder is a Plone product plugin that warns you of possible
        file duplications in your Plone website.
        
        It provides custom validators (that can be ignored with a checkbox on the form)
        that warns the user if the file or image being uploaded is a possible duplicate
        of a file already in the site.
        
        It also provides a portlet that will show any possible file duplications when
        on the context of any file or image.
        
        Works with the ATContentTypes ATFile and ATImage as well as Blobs.
        
        
        Validators:
        -----------
        Validators are run when an object is newly created or being edited. They are
        used to for example check that the fields of the object where correctly filled
        in.
        
        slc.dublettefinder registers three new validators for the main two file containing objects
        (ATFile and ATImage), and you can easily register them for your own file
        containing objects. See ./extensions/configure.zcml
        
        The validators are called isUniqueObjectName, isUniqueFileName and
        isUniqueFileSize and can be found in ./validators.py.
        
        The first validator check the object's Title against all other objects of the
        same type in the database, and warns you if there is a match.
        
        The second validator checks the uploaded file's name against files in the
        database and the third validator checks the file's size.
        
        All three validators will warn you if they find a match, and then allow you to
        override them (by clicking a checkbox) and continue adding your object.
        
        Portlet:
        --------
        A custom portlet is also provided, that will show you any possible duplicates
        of the object/context that you are currently viewing.
