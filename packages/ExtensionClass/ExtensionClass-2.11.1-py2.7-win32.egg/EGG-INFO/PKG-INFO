Description: ExtensionClass and ExtensionClass-related packages
        ==================================================
        
        ExtensionClass
        --------------
        
        This package provides a metaclass that allows classes implemented in
        extension modules to be subclassed in Python.  Unless you need
        ExtensionClasses for legacy applications (e.g. Zope 2), you probably
        want to use Python's new-style classes (available since Python 2.2).
        
        ComputedAttribute
        -----------------
        
        This package provides a way to attach attributes to an
        ``ExtensionClass`` or instance that are computed by calling a
        callable.  This works very much like ``property`` known from new-style
        classes, except that a ``ComputedAttribute`` can also be attached to
        an instance and that it honours ExtensionClass semantics (which is
        useful for retaining Acquisition wrappers, for example).
        
        MethodObject
        ------------
        
        This package lets you attach additional "methods" to ExtensionClasses.
        These "methods" are actually implemented by subclassing the
        ``MethodObject.Method`` class and implementing the ``__call__`` method
        there.  Instances of those classes will be bound to the instances
        they're attached to and will receive that instance object as a first
        parameter (after ``self``).
