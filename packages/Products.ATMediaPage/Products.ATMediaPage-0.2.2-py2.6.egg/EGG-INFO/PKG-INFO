Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ATMediaPage is a simple and easy to use Plone Page which can contain AT Images with changeable layout.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.5 and 4.0b3).
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or via the setup.py script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing Products.ATMediaPage is even simpler. You can install Products.ATMediaPage by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = Products.ATMediaPage
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        * Add a new MediaPage in the Plone way like a new document.
        * Then you can add some Images into the MediaPage like into a folder.
        * You can also copy images from anywhere in your Plone site.
        * The MediaPage will show the images depended on the layout of the selected page template.
        * You can change the layout by choosing another view on display action-list.
        
        Note
        ----
        
        You must publish the MediaPage and all images inside the MediaPage! If you forget to publish an image it will not show up in the MediaPage!
