        Gateway interface between non-standard types and JSON_ serialization.
        
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Requirements:
        
            * python 2.6+
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can add custom types to the JSON serializer proxy by adding them to the
        default ``ENCODER`` or ``DECODER`` instances::
        
            >>> from jsonproxy import ENCODER, DECODER, dumps
            >>> class Point(object):
            ...     def __init__(self, x, y):
            ...         self.x = x
            ...         self.y = y
            ...     def __repr__(self):
            ...         return '<Point x=%d, y=%d>' % (self.x, self.y)
            ...
            >>> ENCODER.register('point',
            ...     lambda obj: isinstance(obj, Point),
            ...     lambda obj: [obj.x, obj.y])
            ...
            >>> DECODER.register('point',
            ...     lambda obj: Point(obj[0], obj[1]))
            ...
            >>> dumps(Point(23, 42))
            {"__proxy__": "point", "value": [23, 42]}
