2.0b1 (2010-09-11)
------------------

- The fact of setting dummy to the container generate an AddedObjectEvent, 
  Products.CMFCore.CMFCatalogAware.handleContentishEvent catch the event and call wftool.notifyCreated(dummy).
  Products.CMFCore 2.2, in Products.CMFCore.WorkflowTool.notifyCreated, added a check,
  wf.notifyCreated is not called if it was previously called (workflow_history not empty).
  So in the tests, wftool.notifyCreated(dummy) does nothing after the dummy object has been set to the container.
  All the tests have been adapted and fixed.

- Removed the explicit check "event.transition is None, then return" in
  react.object_transitioned subscriber.
  We want the roles mapping to be updated if the confidential state
  is the initial state.

- Fixed workflow GenericSetup import, the _initDCWorkflow signature changed
  in Products.DCWorkflow 2.2 used by Plone 4. This version will not work
  anymore with Products.DCWorkflow 2.1 used by Plone 3.
