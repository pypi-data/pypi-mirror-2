Description: Introduction
        ============
        collective.transcode.daemon is an XML-RPC daemon servicing requests for
        transcoding jobs.
        
        It was initially developed during the Plone Video Sprint that took place
        right after the Plone Conference 2009 in Budapest. It was based on the
        darksnow.convertdaemon code but has evolved a lot since
        
        - https://svn.atreal.net/public/svn.darksnow.org/ConvertDaemon
        
        It's  currently used for video transcoding in Plumi 3.0 and 3.1 and is a part
        of the collective.transcode.* suite for Plone 3.x & 4.x.
        
        - http://plumi.org
        - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transcode.star
        
        Even though the only it has only been integrated with Plone, There is nothing Plone
        specific the the collective.transcode.daemon package.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        Apart from what is assembled by the buildout, the following dependencies must
        be installed manually for the transcoding scripts to work:
        
        - ffmpeg with x264 support
        - ffmpeg2theora
        
        In Ubuntu 10.04 you can install the above using the following commands:
        
        sudo wget --output-document=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list http://www.medibuntu.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list && sudo apt-get --quiet update && sudo apt-get --yes --quiet --allow-unauthenticated install medibuntu-keyring && sudo apt-get --quiet update
        
        sudo aptitude install build-essential libavcodec-unstripped-52 ffmpeg ffmpeg2theora
        
        The daemon has been tested with Python2.4 and Python2.6.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The instructions below are for setting up a standalone transcode daemon.
        
        If you want a complete transcoding solution for the Plone CMS use
        collective.transcode.star:
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transcode.star
        
        Buildout
        ~~~~~~~~
        The best way to install a standalone daemon is to use zc.buildout and the
        buildout.cfg file provided::
        
        python2.6 bootstrap.py
        ./bin/buildout
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        On buildout.cfg, upon transcodedaemon section, the following settings can be
        configured::
        
        listen_host = locahost   # IP address or hostname to listen
        listen_port = 8888       # Port to use
        videofolder = transcoded # Path of folder where transcoded videos are stored
        secret = sh4r3dkey       # Secret key shared between daemon and app
        profiles = ...           # A dictionary of supported transcoding profiles
        
        You can change the quality and format of the transcoded files by editing the transcoding
        scripts provided in the scripts dir.
