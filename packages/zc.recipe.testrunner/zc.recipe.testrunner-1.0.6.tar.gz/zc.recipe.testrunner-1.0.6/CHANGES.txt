1.0.0b7 (2007-04-26)

Feature Changes

  buildout.cfg to specify environment variables that should be set before
  running the tests.

1.0.0b6 (2007-02-25)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- If the working directory is not specified, or specified as the empty
  string, an empty part directory is created for the tests to run in.

1.0.0b5 (2007-01-24)
====================

Bugs fixed
----------

- When:

  + the working-directory option was used,
  + and the test runner needed to restart itself
  + and the test runner was run with a relative path (e.g. bin/test)

  then the testrunner could not restart itself successfully because the
  relative path in sys.argv[0] was no-longer valid.

  Now we convert sys.argv[0] to an absolute path.
