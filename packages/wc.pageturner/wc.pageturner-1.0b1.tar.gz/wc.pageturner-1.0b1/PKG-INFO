Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package is a Plone product that will add a `Page Turner` view to the File content type. 
        The result is that you'll be able to view PDFs much in the same way you can view them on
        scribd.com. It uses the open source project, Flex Paper, to display the PDFs. You can find
        information about it at `http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/`.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This product requires that you have pdf2swf installed. pdf2swf is included with SWFTools.
        I suggest you stick with the package managers to install this as there are some dependencies
        that need to be installed.
        
        If you're using Ubuntu Lucid, you can find a swftools download at `http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/swftools`
        that seem to work.
        
        If all else fails, you can download SWF tools from `http://www.swftools.org/`. 
        
        
        How-To
        ------
        
        * Add your PDF as a file to your Plone site.
        
        * Edit the various setting of the Page turner by clicking the `Page Turner Settings` button that is now available
        
        * To turn off auto-selecting of the page turner layout for PDF files, go to ZMI -> portal_properties -> site_properties and
          customize the page_turner_auto_select_layout property to off.
        
        
        Tested With
        -----------
        
        * Plone 3 and 4
        
        * Also works with Blob storage transparently so the converted PDFs aren't stored in the ZODB
        
        
        Credits
        -------
        
        Credit goes to Wildcard corp and Talin Senner for sponsoring and designing the product and Nathan Van Gheem for coding it.
