Description: ponzi_evolution
        ---------------
        
        SQLAlchemy manager for repoze.evolution. Provides a simple way to
        implement schema migrations as a directory of numbered Python scripts.
        
        ``ponzi_evolution`` keeps a table with (packagename, version) tuples and
        will pass a SQLAlchemy session to numbered evolveN.py scripts to bring
        the schema for ``packagename`` up-to-date. All you have to do is write
        the Python and SQL needed to make that happen.
        
        
        0.8998
        ------
        
        - Improved packagibility (MANIFEST.in specified)
        - SQLAlchemyEvolutionManager no longer calls session.commit(); this is
          your responsibility after the migration has completed.
