.. rubric:: Welcome to the documentation of Transifex, the open localization platform.

Transifex is a modern, open-source localization platform. It's a web system
which automates the translation workflow of complex international projects.

To use Transifex, visit Transifex.net_, our one-stop, batteries-included

infrastructure.
