What's with all the strange names?
----------------------------------

Each release marks a huge amount of effort and hours by many people, and
includes a number of features, which, when combined, produce a landmark in the
development of Transifex. So we give them names, which have some common
attribute with the release.

Transifex releases are named after X-Men villains. These are bad guys from the X-men
series of comics. For more information, check out the `X-Men Wikipedia Article`_
as well as the links provided inside each release notes to the respective villain.

During the 0.3 release cycle (also known as the Turbogears or simply Stone Age),
releases were named after movies.
