 Transifex version 0.5.x release notes
======================================

Welcome to the Transifex 0.5 release.


Transifex 0.5 (Gold)
====================

Released:
  March 19th, 2009


Summary
-------

This release represents a significant advance in Transifex development since
the Transifex 0.3 release in November 2008, maybe even the creation of Transifex
itself in 2007. The single most major change is the complete re-write of the
code from scratch, migrating to the Django framework, but also the multitude
of features added, both of which signify a turning point in Transifex's history.

Here's a 40K-foot view of the release in numbers::

Transifex 0.5 comes with a multitude of features, most of them introduced in
this release.


Major features
--------------

- Complete re-write of the source code on top of the Django_ Web framework
- New data model supporting multiple repositories per project (eg. branches
  or domains of files), and project collections (eg. Fedora, GNOME, etc.)
- Calculation of a project's translation coverage (statistics)
- Submission support of files to a variety of version control systems
- Support for serving translation files to users for easy access to them 
- User registrations and authentication (including OpenID)

Translation files
:::::::::::::::::

- Statistics: Analysis of translation files and generation of completeness
  charts (translation statistics)

- Statistics generation per project, language or release
- In-browser viewing of translation files with syntax highlighting
- Direct download of translation files
- Support for locale variants (eg. pt_BR, pt-br, etc)
- Support for statistics-only projects (no submission) 
- Pre-commit hook to check the syntax validity of the submitted translation
  file


User experience
:::::::::::::::

  used by priviledged users to control the objects (Create Projects, Edit
  Collections etc).
- RSS feeds for every major element in the system.
- New and revamped theme, using the awesome Silk_ icon set from famfamfam
- Support for Tags on various objects like projects and collections
- Search support in object information with result highlighting
- Easier navigation with breadcrumb-like positional links (You are here: ...)
- Pagination of object lists for easy navigation
- Support for notification on changes in registered projects. The feature is
  also extensible for more notifications.
- Support for long descriptions of objects using Markdown_ syntax for rich
  markup and presentation.
- Enhanced user experience using Javascript events and AJAX support 
- Easy-to-access contact form for direct reporting of issues and comments
- I18n support for multiple User Interface languages

- Profile management features (change/remind password, change email, delete
  account, etc.)
- Model action history (logging changes to information) for transparency and
  security


Deployment
::::::::::

- Support for any Django-supported database platform (SQLite, MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, etc.)
- User permissions support, allowing fine-grained permission handling per
  user (eg. 'can_add_projects', 'can_refresh_cache', etc)
- Full-blown, flexible admin interface for easy-to-access administration for
  user permissions and all other entities in the system, as well as for
  debugging
- Custom authentication backends to connect the Tx users to legacy databases
- Support for highly customizable deployment, including overriding of VCS
  backends, themes and custom classes for i18n support in projects
- "Pretty" URLs by allowing project identifiers (slugs) containing alphanumeric
  characters and dashes.
- Custom error messages (404, 500, etc.)
- Extensible templating system, with support for per-host partial overriding
- Flexible CLI script for scheduled statistics updates
- Support for database schema evolution for painless upgrades 
- RPM packages available for Transifex and its dependencies
- Protection against CSRF attacks
- Documentation using the Sphinx library


Platform
::::::::

- Refactoring of the version control system level, supporting
  cvs, svn, hg, git and bzr repositories hosted anywhere on the Internet.
- Support for multiple Components in one Project (eg. branches)
- Fine-grained hosting choices: Components can come from different sources (eg.
  VCS repositories) while belonging to the same project
- Extensible codebase for other projects to be able to build on top of the
  platform
- Pluggable and reusable Python VCS layer (transifex.vcs)
- Rich validation of user input in edit forms and error reporting on bogus
  information.
- Extensible sub-system for easy addition of more l10n types
- Backwards compatibility with Python v2.4


Bugfixes from 0.3.x release
---------------------------

- Local cache refresh times are now per-branch (#15)
- Versioning system dependencies are now soft, as Tx only depends on hg (#51)
- Support for OpenID logins (#9)
- Support for search in project names and descriptions (#23)
- ... and a bunch of others that are now considered irrelevant, outdated or just
  obsolete.
