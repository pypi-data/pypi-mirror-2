- HTML: A rich rendering of the docs is also available in HTML format, with
  inter-links, nice formatting, searching, automatic indexing etc. Just fire
  up your browser and point it at the 'html/' directory.

Instructions on how to build the docs can be found in the README file inside
the '_devel/' directory.
