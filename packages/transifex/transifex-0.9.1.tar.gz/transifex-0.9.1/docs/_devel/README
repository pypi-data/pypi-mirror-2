 Building Transifex Docs
=========================

To build the docs, you will need to have a working Transifex system
(dependencies there, ``python manage.py shell`` working). If you're using a
virtualenv, make sure you enable it. Additionally, sphinx must be installed in
your virtualenv.

To build the HTML version of the docs, just run::

  cd plaintext
  make html

The HTML output will be in ``docs/html/``.


Publishing the docs
===================

To build and publish the docs (e.g. before a Tx release), I usually do
something like::

  cd plaintext
  workon current
  make clean && make html

  cd ../html
  chromium-browser index.html
  scpresume * txo:webapps/txo_docs/

To get the translators for the past release::

  hg log -r 0.7:tip --template "{desc|firstline} -- {author|person}\n" | \
  grep 'l10n' | sort | uniq

To datamine the new dependencies:

  hg diff -r 0.7:tip setup.py
