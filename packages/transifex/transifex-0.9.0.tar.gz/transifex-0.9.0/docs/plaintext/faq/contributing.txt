FAQ: Contributing code
======================

How can I get started contributing code to Transifex?
-----------------------------------------------------


I submitted a bug fix several weeks ago. Why are you ignoring my patch?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't worry: We're not ignoring you!

It's important to understand there is a difference between "a ticket is being
ignored" and "a ticket has not been attended to yet." Our ticket system
contains hundreds of open tickets, of various degrees of impact on end-user
functionality, and Transifex's developers have to review and prioritize.

On top of that: the people who work on Transifex are all volunteers. As a result,
the amount of time that we have to work on the framework is limited and will
vary from week to week depending on our spare time. If we're busy, we may not
be able to spend as much time on Transifex as we might want.

Besides, if your feature request stands no chance of inclusion in Transifex, we
won't ignore it -- we'll just close the ticket. So if your ticket is still
open, it doesn't mean we're ignoring you; it just means we haven't had time to
look at it yet.
