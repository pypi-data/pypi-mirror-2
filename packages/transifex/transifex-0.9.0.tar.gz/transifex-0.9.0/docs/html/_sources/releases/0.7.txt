What's new in Transifex 0.7
---------------------------

The following major features were introduced in this release.


Online Translation Editor
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the often requested features in Transifex was an online translation
editor. Users would like to perform simple translation tasks straight from
their browser.

Transifex 0.7 includes an exciting feature in beta mode: 'Lotte', the
lightweight online translation editor.

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_lotte.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter
   
Projects which have enabled translation submission get a new icon, which
translators can click to translate through the browser. Of course, the choice
of uploading normal translated files still applies.

Here are some of the features you can find in Lotte:

* Live translation from inside the browser itself. No extra addons needed.
* Support for all languages which come built-in with Transifex.
* Machine-powered translation suggestions for every string with the click of
  a button using the `Google Translate API`_. At the time of writing, the
* Translation support for PO-based and intltool-powered translation files.
  number of supported languages is 42.
* Live update of the translation completion during the translation process.
* Upon completion of the work, the file is automatically submitted to the
  remote project.
* Dynamic filtering of viewable strings: Choose to display translated, fuzzy,
  untranslated strings, or a combination of them.
* Color-based identification of the string state for ultra-fast location of
  the strings needing the user's attention.
* Sortable list of translation strings by ID, source string, or translated
  version.
* Contextual information: Translators are presenting with a link to the
  relevant source code lines, should they need to get more context for a
  string. 

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_lotte    2.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter

Note that currently Lotte is enabled only for files with less than 100 strings
for efficiency reasons. Improvements to the interface to enable efficient
handling of larger files are scheduled with a next release.   


More control to Project Maintainers
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_edit-project.png
   :class: shot2

This release features a major addition to the Transifex engine, which unlocks
a multitude of new possibilities for controlling who can do what on the
service. Support is now included for fine-grained permission control, allowing
the definition of access control lists for a variety of actions.

These fine-grained permissions come *in addition* to the global permission
support Transifex includes. One user of your deployment can have the permission
"Can do Foo on any project", and another one the "Can do Foo on project Bar"
one.

Project details control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are now able to modify the details of their projects. They
can alter the associated information, control the components they have
registered and the releases they are assigned to.

Registering projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_acl.png
   :class: shot2

Transifex now allows users to register their own projects. People who do this
automatically become maintainers of the project, and later on they can choose
to pass on the maintainership to other people, or simply add more people on
the maintainers list.

To enable this feature, the admin needs to give the permission
'projects.add_project' to the group of users with the name 'registered'.
This can be done as usual from the admin panel.

Per-project submitters list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project maintainers are now able to choose who can submit files to their
repository. This can help the maintainer form a group of translators who he
trusts, which is specific to his project. Using a special form, one can add
one by one the translators they trust.

Additionally, users themselves can request access to a project. The maintainer
will be notified with this request and act upon it. The user has the choice to
revoke his request, if he chooses so.

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_request-submit-access.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter


Submissions to a mailbox
::::::::::::::::::::::::

In addition to submitting files to remote versioning systems over SSH,
Transifex now supports submission via email to the project maintainers. This
could be useful for setup scenarios such as the following:

1. The content repository is living behind a firewall and/or NAT, making
   external connections harder to configure and manage.

2. The upstream repository does not allow SSH access (eg. it only supports
   ``https``).

3. The repository pulls from a tarball hosted on the net (eg. it's an archived
   release), to which Transifex has no way to submit files.  

4. The maintainer chooses to have a tighter control of what is landing in his
   repository.

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_submit-via-email.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter

.. note::

    Submissions via email are **not** stored on the Transifex server. The
    translation statistics are not updated with the commit, since there is no
    way to know if the maintainer is indeed going to commit the file in his
    repository.


User Profiles
:::::::::::::

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_avatar.png
   :class: shot2

Transifex 0.7 features a brand new backend for user account and profile
management. Users are able to include information about themselves and manage
their account in detail. Here are some of the features supported:

- Avatar support
- Google Maps Integration for specifying the user's exact location (tab
  disabled temporarily in 0.7).
- Standard account features: Register for a new account, login/logout
- Password management (change password, recover lost one, etc.)
- Email address modification 
- Ability to clear profile information

.. warning::

    OpenID was dropped in this release. The plan is to re-add it in a next
    release, depending on the feedback from our users. 


Publican-like I18n Support
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_publican.png
   :class: shot2

This new i18n support method allows handling of Publican-like documents. These
include multiple source and translation files, allowing more than one people
translating the same language by working on different files at the same time.
Publican is the base tool for building the Fedora Project documents such as
the Release Notes.


Simplified branching support
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex 0.7 drops support for VCS "branches" for Subversion, Mercurial and
Bazaar versioning systems. These VCS types traditionally define "big-picture"
branches: a checkout/clone of a particular URL is considered a "branch".

By dropping the input of a branch name for these types, Transifex allows users
to define just any URL they want, as long as it's a URL which can be checked
out or cloned.

With this feature, support is added for non-standard branching names for
Subversion repositories (contrary to the ``/trunk`` and ``/branches/<name>``
scheme. When adding your repository, just provide the full URL as your
root, like so::

    http://svn.example.com/svn/mybranches/1.1
    svn://svn.example.com/svn/trunk

Furthermore, the default branch name for Mercurial has been renamed to 'default',
which is a better branch name to use than 'tip'.

An automatic data evolution for Subversion and Mercurial repositories is
included, which will migrate your data to support the newer branch definition
format.

Support for Git and CVS branches continues as before.


Improved URL structure
::::::::::::::::::::::

Quite a few URLs have been slightly modified in this release. In particular,
keywords in the URLs have been prepended with a letter denoting the action
taking place. This improves the namespace of the URLs for future additions and
enhances usability by distinguishing parts in the URL which are keywords.
(#298)

The following structure is now used::

    <section>/<object_alias>/<object_slug>/<action>

Here are some examples::

    /projects/transifex/        → /projects/p/transifex/
    /projects/transifex/default → /projects/p/transifex/c/default
    /languages/pt_BR            → /languages/l/pt_BR/

.. warning::

    This is a backwards incompatible change. Please modify your links and
    notify your users to update their bookmarks.


User sign in changes
::::::::::::::::::::

- By default users are kept logged in for 3 weeks. This is an option which can
  be configured by the administrator from the setting files.
- Upon account creation, users are now automatically added to a group called
  'registered'. This way, admins can add permissions to all eponymous users,
  distinguishing them from the anonymous ones.
- Replaced 'Log in' template occurrences to 'Sign in'.


I18n support improvements
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_zebra.png
   :class: shot2

- A new command was added, ``./manage.py txcompilemessages``, which replaces
  Django's own ``compilemessages``, since the latter recursively builds all PO
  files for many more things than the ones we need. This affects admins who are
  building their own Transifex PO files.
- 0.7 adds built-in support for the following new languages:

  - Asturian (ast)
  - Esperanto (eo)
  - Irish (ga)
  - Kashmiri (ks)
  - Kirgyz (ky)
  - Latin (la)
  - Xhosa (xh)

- Added support for a whooping set of language code aliases (#267).
- Added number of languages and projects to the index view
- Added toggle to expand and collapse the multi source files div (#220).
- Commit messages are now by default prepended with the keyword 'l10n' prefix
  (#209). This option is configurable through the setting files.
- Commit messages now have the user's profile info embedded instead of just
  the username (#235).
- Management command ``create_languages`` has been renamed to
  ``txcreatelanguages`` to improve compatibility with other Transifex commands.

Easier File Logging
:::::::::::::::::::

Transifex now comes pre-configured with logging support to a file on the disk
in the ``logs/`` directory. You can control the verbosity through the
corresponding configuration options. Make sure the directory is created by
running the command ``./manage.py txcreatedirs``.

Here is a sample output of the file, with the logging level set to ``DEBUG``::
 
    2009-08-21 18:29:05,812 DEBUG Requested stats calc for component usermode.tip
    2009-08-21 18:29:05,813 DEBUG Updating local repo for usermode.tip
    2009-08-21 18:29:05,816 DEBUG Preparing repo for vcsunit usermode.tip
    2009-08-21 18:29:16,405 DEBUG Repowatch revision file po/as.po: Old: (...L,), New: (...L,)
    2009-08-21 18:29:16,450 DEBUG Setting stats for tip (Usermode)

    2009-08-21 18:29:23,437 INFO localhost -- [GET /projects/p/usermode/c/tip/ HTTP/1.1] 200 10997

Getting Transifex 0.7
---------------------

Project and community managers who want to deploy Transifex for their 
own community can get Transifex in a variety of ways. 

A tarball of Transifex 0.7 is available from the following locations:

* The Transifex.org Download section: http://transifex.org/files/
* The Python Packaging Index (Cheeseshop): http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transifex/

RPM packages for Fedora 9, Fedora 10, and Fedora Rawhide are or will 
soon be available via yum::

    yum install transifex transifex-extras 

RPM packages for RHEL 5, CentOS 5, and Scientific Linux 5 will be 
available in the `Fedora EPEL`_ yum repository. 

Information about installing Transifex can be found in the
:ref:`Installation documentation <intro-install>`.

.. note::

    If you are interested in reading the Installation documentation exactly how
    it looked like when 0.7 was released, please refer to our archived
    `Install Docs for 0.7`_. 
    


The Transifex Appliance
:::::::::::::::::::::::

If you want to play with the latest Transifex code, you may want to use our
development images for the Transifex Appliance. Following the stand-alone,
"batteries included" model of software appliances, you get a complete
Transifex system with all dependencies and services pre-configured so that
you can start experimenting with it right away. Choose from ISO, VMware or EC2
images, for both x86 and x86_64 architectures to run on a virtual machine,
dedicated server or using a virtualization software.

.. image:: ../../screenshots/0.7/0.7_appliance_front_page.png
   :class: shot2 alcenter

Your appliances can be updated using its own web based management system by
pointing your browser to the appliance’s IP using port 8003. Login with the
credentials 'admin' and 'password'. Make sure to change the password once
you’ve successfully logged in.

This appliance version is based on the 0.7 branch of Transifex, where a couple
of projects have already been created for you to play with. Log in using either
guest/guest or editor/editor as your user name and password combination and
tinker to your heart’s content!

Make sure to read the documentation and file issues/send us your feedback.

Upgrading to 0.7
----------------

To upgrade the code, update your package distribution as usual. Here are some
additional steps you might need to execute, depending on your environment:

1. Install dependencies
:::::::::::::::::::::::

The following dependencies were *added* in this version:

- Imaging (Python Imaging Library, PIL)
- polib
- django-authority
- South
- django-piston
- django-profile (named 'userprofile')
- mercurial >= 1.3

The following dependencies were *removed* in this version:

- python-openid
- django-evolution

For instructions on how to install them, refer to the
:ref:`Installation docs <intro-install>`. You'll need to complete this step
before actually doing the database upgrade.


2. Schema and data migration
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Transifex includes a script which will automatically migrate your database to
the new schema from the previous version. All you need to do, from a clean
0.6 schema, is run the following::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate 0001_initial --all --fake
    ./manage.py migrate

To upgrade from a 0.5 schema to 0.7 you first need to upgrade your schema to
0.6 and from there to 0.7. Instructions for the first step can be found in the
relevant section of the :ref:`Transifex 0.6 release notes <upgrading-to-0-6>`.


3. New generic data
:::::::::::::::::::

Finally, run the following two commands to add any new objects updated from the
last release::

    ./manage.py txcreatelanguages
    ./manage.py txcreatenoticetypes


4. Configuration settings
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Finally, review the changes which have happened in the configuration settings
and update yours accordingly. If your config file are stored in a place not
handled by the upgrade, then you'll need to copy them over or update them.

In general, if you have overridden your settings in a file such as
``90-local.conf`` you should be OK since the upgrade will just update the other
files and leave that alone.

Released:
  January 22, 2010

Diffstat:
  6 files changed, 116 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)

Affected releases:
  This security issue affects instances running the 0.7.x branch only. The
  previous versions only allowed administrators to modify projects.


Details
-------

Prior to this release, a project maintainer could define a special URL which
Transifex has access to, but resides on the filesystem. This
way users could gain unauthorized access to local versioned repositories on the
Transifex server. This applied to distributed VCSs and can be accomplished by
defining the correct local path as the repository URL
(eg. ``/transifex/local_repos/git/...``).

The allowed repository root URLs are now limited to specific prefixes, such as
``ssh://`` and ``http://``, via a validator which verifies that the URL has a
correct prefix. The list of allowed prefixes is a white list and is defined in
the vcs-related config files, ``settings/60-vcs.conf`` and
``settings/80-vcs-extras.conf``.

Additionally, a new basic validation has been added, which does not allow the
use of repositories which have been registered to other projects.

Transifex instances which are affected are those allowing users to add their
own projects (``project_add`` permission open) or are using project
maintainers instead of site-wide admins only.

This release adds a new configuration option: ``ALLOWED_REPOSITORY_PREFIXES``.
You can download it from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transifex/0.7.4.

Transifex 0.7 Release Candidates
