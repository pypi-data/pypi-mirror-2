    project
        A project in Transifex represents a software package which is usually
        stored on a VCS repository. A project repository might include
        multiple translatable resources like documentation and UI, and also
        ship multiple branches of its code.

    slug
        A short label for something, containing only letters, numbers,
        underscores or hyphens. They're generally used in URLs. For
        example, in a typical Transifex project URL:
        
        .. parsed-literal::
        
            http://www.transifex.net/**anaconda**/
            
        the last bit (``anaconda``) is the slug.

    VCS
        A Version Control System (also known as source control/code management)
        is a system used to manage multiple revisions of the same unit of
        information. Examples of VCS systems include Bazaar, CVS, Git,
        Mercurial and Subversion.
