1.0.2 (2010-04-18)
------------------

- **Security issue:** The traverser defined for
  ``IPageletBrowserLayer`` was a trusted adapter, so the security
  proxy got removed from each traversed object. Thus all sub-objects
  were publically accessable, too.

  Making this change might BREAK your application!
  That means if security is not well declared.


1.0.1 (2008-01-24)
------------------

- Bug: Improved meta-data.


1.0.0 (2008-01-21)
------------------

- Restructure: Move ``z3c.layer.minimal`` package to it's own top level
  package form ``zope.layer`` to ``z3c.layer.minimal``.

- Restructure: Moved implementation from ``z3c.layer`` to
  ``z3c.layer.minimal``


0.2.3 (2007-11-07)
------------------

- Forward-Bug: Due to a bug in mechanize, the testbrowser throws
  ``httperror_seek_wrapper`` instead of ``HTTPError`` errors. Thanks to RE
  normalizers, the code will now work whether the bug is fixed or not in
  mechanize.


0.2.2 (2007-10-31)
------------------

- Bug: Fixed package meta-data.
