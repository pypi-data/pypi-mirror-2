-----------------
* This version has been used for a long time.


10 October, 2008 (DP):
    - API: Finished refactoring that created the application_menus.py module
        which allows data-driven creation of application menus for both KDE
        and Gnome on RH3, RH4, and probably other modern Linux distributions.
        The RH4 implementation creates application menu files that conform to
        FreeDesktop.org's Desktop Menu Specification 1.0.  Though users may
        need to modify the application_menus.py module to get it to try that
        implementation on another distribution or version. [22265]
