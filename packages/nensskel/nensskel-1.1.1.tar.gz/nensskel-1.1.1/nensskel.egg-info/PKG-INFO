Description: Django code skeletons
        =====================
        
        ``nensskel`` provides so-called "paster templates" for easy creation of new
        django applications, websites and python libraries.  They're not fully
        generic, as they originate within one company.  See the note further down.
        
        The nensskel script creates a directory structure with lots of basic files
        (like a readme and a setup.py) already there and partially filled in.
        Optionally it also creates a trunk/tags/branches structure in svn for you.
        
        Just call the nensskel script to get usage information.
        
        Installation can be done by a simple::
        
            $> easy_install nensskel
        
        
        Company-centricity
        ------------------
        
        Nensskel originates at `Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_,
        so we've of course set it up just the way we like it.  And we change it the
        way we like it.
        
        It does, however, give you a good example for full django applications/sites
        with a complete setup.  For example, the django sites come with a full-blown
        apache config.  And django-staticfiles is included for the easy css/js setup.
        
        
        Example for your own skeleton
        -----------------------------
        
        When you want to create your own skeleton, nensskel can be a nice, small
        example.  Just download the .tar.gz and unpack it.
        
        Do the regular ``python bootstrap.py && bin/buildout`` and you're set up.  The
        nensskel and paster script are created in the bin/ directory.
        
        There's one python script in ``nensskel/*.py`` per template.  The actual
        templates are in ``nensskel/templates/*``.  See
        http://pythonpaste.org/script/developer.html for some limited documentation on
        what paster can do.  If you want more elaborate examples:
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk/ is the most elaborate set
        of templates available.
        
        
        Changelog for nensskel
        ======================
        
        
        1.1.1 (2010-08-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Documentation update.
        
        
        1.1 (2010-08-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed test setup of djangoapp and lizardsite to match Reinout's latest
          experiments :-)
        
        
        1.0 (2010-08-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Added coverage support both to nensskel itself and to the templates.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-08-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Added django compressor settings to the lizardsite template.
        
        - Added lizard-ui as a standard dependency for django applications.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-05-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed ipython as it regularly fails to download, sadly.  Can be re-added
          after buildout gains a timeout setting (in the .cfg files).
        
        
        0.3 (2010-03-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Django STATIC_URL/MEDIA_URL clarification and usage improvement after
          discussion on http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-staticfiles/issue/12/
        
        - Added apache config (with a separate one for windows that still needs some
          work).
        
        
        0.2 (2010-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Django fixes after using skeleton in real life.
        
        
        0.1 (2010-02-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Added ``nensskel`` script as a handy wrapper around ``paster create``.
        
        - Added lizardsite skeleton (which needs checking and probably modifications).
        
        - Added djangoapp skeleton.
        
        - Added library skeleton.
        
        - Added test that creates instances of all skeletons and runs their
          bin/buildout.  Smoke test: switch everything on and see if smoke comes out.
        
        - Reinout copied relevant parts from the thaskel and zestskel that he made for
          the two previous companies he worked for.
        
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        - Add example doctest setup after I figured out how to get doctests running
          again with this django+nose+djangorecipe combination.
