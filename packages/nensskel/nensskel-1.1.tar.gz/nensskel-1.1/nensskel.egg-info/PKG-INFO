Description: Paster skeletons for Nelen & Schuurmans
        =======================================
        
        ``nensskel`` provides so-called "paster templates" for easy creation of new
        lizard websites, libraries and so on.
        
        The nensskel script creates a directory structure with lots of basic files
        (like a readme and a setup.py) already there and partially filled in.
        Optionally it also creates a trunk/tags/branches structure in svn for you.
        
        Just call the nensskel script to get usage information.
        
        
        Installation can be done as a development installation or by a simple::
        
            $> easy_install -i http://lizardpackages.vanrees.org nensskel
        
        
        Development installation
        ------------------------
        
        Do the regular ``python bootstrap.py && bin/buildout`` and you're set up.  The
        nensskel and paster script are created in the bin/ directory.
        
        There's one python script in ``nensskel/*.py`` per template.  The actual
        templates are in ``nensskel/templates/*``.  See
        http://pythonpaste.org/script/developer.html for some limited documentation on
        what paster can do.  If you want examples:
        http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk/ is the most elaborate set
        of templates available.
        
        Run the tests with ``bin/test`` and don't forget to look at the buildbot after
        you made changes as it is particularly easy to make only-works-locally
        mistakes when working on paster templates.
        
        
        Changelog for nensskel
        ======================
        
        
        1.1 (2010-08-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed test setup of djangoapp and lizardsite to match Reinout's latest
          experiments :-)
        
        
        1.0 (2010-08-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Added coverage support both to nensskel itself and to the templates.
        
        
        0.5 (2010-08-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Added django compressor settings to the lizardsite template.
        
        - Added lizard-ui as a standard dependency for django applications.
        
        
        0.4 (2010-05-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed ipython as it regularly fails to download, sadly.  Can be re-added
          after buildout gains a timeout setting (in the .cfg files).
        
        
        0.3 (2010-03-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Django STATIC_URL/MEDIA_URL clarification and usage improvement after
          discussion on http://bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-staticfiles/issue/12/
        
        - Added apache config (with a separate one for windows that still needs some
          work).
        
        
        0.2 (2010-02-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Django fixes after using skeleton in real life.
        
        
        0.1 (2010-02-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Added ``nensskel`` script as a handy wrapper around ``paster create``.
        
        - Added lizardsite skeleton (which needs checking and probably modifications).
        
        - Added djangoapp skeleton.
        
        - Added library skeleton.
        
        - Added test that creates instances of all skeletons and runs their
          bin/buildout.  Smoke test: switch everything on and see if smoke comes out.
        
        - Reinout copied relevant parts from the thaskel and zestskel that he made for
          the two previous companies he worked for.
        
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        - Lizardsite: add django fastcgi setup.
        
        - Lizardsite: add django apache config.
        
        - Lizardsite: add log and www dir.
        
        - Lizardsite: find better way for development tools (off in deployment).
        
        - Lizardsite: use mkdir recipe to add var/media dir
        
        - Lizardsite: add var/media dir hosting to apache config.
        
        - Lizardsite: figure out ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX. Probably use django-staticmedia's
          STATIC_MEDIA/admin instead.
