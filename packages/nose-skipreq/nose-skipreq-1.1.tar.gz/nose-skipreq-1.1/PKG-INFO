Description: This is a simple nose plugin which acts like the SkipTest plugin for Google's
        RequestError exception.
        
        Testing against live Google APIs--other than being a bad idea to begin
        with--often results in random RequestError responses from Google. We may not
        want these exceptions to cause test failures as they are transient and may be
        handled gracefully by other parts of the system. To that end, ``nose-skipreq``
        was created.
        
        When running ``nosetests`` with the ``--skip-req`` flag, all tests which raise
        RequestError will be marked SKIP instead of FAIL. That's it!
