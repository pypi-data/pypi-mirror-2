delegates for the various sqlalchemy and camelot field types.

Some delegates take specific arguments into account for their construction.
All :attr:`field_attributes` specified for a certain field will be propagated
towards the constructor of the delegate.  Some of them will be used by the delegate
itself, others will be used by the editor, created by the delegate.
