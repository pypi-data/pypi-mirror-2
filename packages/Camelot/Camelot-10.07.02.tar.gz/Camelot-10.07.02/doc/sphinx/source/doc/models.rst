 Creating models with Elixir/SQLAlchemy/Camelot

The `Elixir website <http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/wiki/TutorialDivingIn>`_ provides a complete overview of 
the creation of models that should be read before reading this section. 

This section describes the various field types that can be used to construct
models. Fields from SQLAlchemy and Camelot are described.

.. automodule:: camelot.view.field_attributes

SQLAlchemy field types
======================

SQLAlchemy provides a number of field types that map to available data types in SQL, more information on those
can be found on the `SQLAlchemy website <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/reference/sqlalchemy/types.html>`_ .
   
Camelot field types
===================

.. automodule:: camelot.types

Python properties as fields
===========================

Normal python properties can be used as fields on forms as well.  In that case, there
will be no introspection to find out how to display the property.  Therefore the delegate 
attribute should be specified explicitely.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/snippet/properties_as_fields.py
  
Attach actions to field changes
===============================

Whenever the value of a field is changed, an action on the model can be triggered by
using properties to manipulate the field instead of manipulating it directly.  The
example below demonstrates how the value of y should be chopped when x is changed.

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../../test/snippet/fields_with_actions.py

Fields calculated by the database
=================================

Having certain summary fields of your models filled by the database has the advantage
that the heavy processing is moved from the client to the server.  Moreover if the 
summary builds on information in related records, having the database build the summary
reduces the need to transfer additional data from the database to the server.

To display fields in the table and the form view that are the result of a calculation 
done by the database, a ColumnProperty needs to be defined in the Elixir model.  In this 
ColumnProperty, the sql query can be defined using sqlalchemy statements.  Then use the 
field attributes mechanism to specify which delegate needs to be used to render the field.

.. image:: ../_static/budget.png

As an example we will create a budget with multiple budget lines, where the total budget 
is calculated by the database ::

	from elixir.properties import ColumnProperty
	from camelot.view.controls import delegates
	from sqlalchemy import sql, and_
	
	class Budget(Entity):
	  lines = OneToMany('BudgetLine')
	  total = ColumnProperty(lambda c:sql.select([sql.func.sum(BudgetLine.amount)], and_(BudgetLine.budget_id==Budget.id)))
	
	   class Admin(EntityAdmin):
	    name = 'Budgets'
	    list_display = [ 'total', 'lines']
	    field_attributes = {'total':{'delegate':delegates.FloatDelegate}} 
	
	class BudgetLine(Entity):
	  budget = ManyToOne('Budget', required=True, ondelete='cascade', onupdate='cascade')
	  amount = Field(Float(precision=2), default=0)
	
	  class Admin(EntityAdmin):
	    name = 'Budget lines'
	    list_display = ['amount',] 
	    
When the user presses F9, all data in the application is refreshed from the database, and thus
all fields are recalculated.

An explanation of the lambda function inside the ColumnProperty can be found in the ElixirColumnProperty_ and
the SqlalchemyMappers_ documentation.
