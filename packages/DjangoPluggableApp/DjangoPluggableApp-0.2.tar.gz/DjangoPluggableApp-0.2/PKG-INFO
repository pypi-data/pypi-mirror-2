Description: 
        DjangoPluggableApp is a package to allow:
        
        - django users to install and configure third-party django applications
        
        - developpers to create an distribute django apps.
        
        DjangoPluggableApp is **not** intrusive. This mean that:
        
        - end users can use applications without a DjangoPluggableApp entry_point in
        their projects
        
        - an application based on the provided template can be used by end users
        without DjangoPluggableApp installed.
