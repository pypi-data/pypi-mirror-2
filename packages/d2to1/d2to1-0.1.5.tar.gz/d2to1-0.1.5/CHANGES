Changes
=========

0.1.5 (2011-06-02)
------------------

- Adds support for the data_files option under [files].  Though this is
  considered deprecated and may go away at some point, it can be useful in the
  absence of resources support
- Adds support for command pre/post-hooks.  Warning: this monkey-patches
  distutils.dist.Distribution a little bit... :(
- Adds (slightly naive) support for PEP 345-style version specifiers in
  requires-dist (environment markers not supported yet)
- Fixed a bug where not enough newlines were inserted between description files


0.1.4 (2011-05-24)
------------------

- Adds support for custom command classes specified in the 'commands' option
  under the [global] section in setup.cfg
- Adds preliminary support for custom compilers specified in the 'compilers'
  option under the [global] section in setup.cfg.  This functionality doesn't
  exist in distutils/setuptools/distribute, so adding support for it is a
  flaming hack.  It hasn't really been tested beyond seeing that the custom
  compilers come up in `setup.py build_ext --help-compiler`, so any real-world
  testing of this feature would be appreciated


0.1.3 (2011-04-20)
------------------

- Adds zest.releaser entry points for updating the version number in a
  setup.cfg file; only useful if you use zest.releaser--otherwise harmless
  (might eventually move this functionality out into a separate product)
- Though version 0.1.2 worked in Python3, use_2to3 wasn't added to the setup.py
  so 2to3 had to be run manually
- Fixed a crash on projects that don't have a description-file option

0.1.2 (2011-04-13)
------------------

- Fixed the self-installation--it did not work if a d2to1 version was not
  already installed, due to the use of `pkg_resources.require()`
- Adds nominal Python3 support
- Fixes the 'classifier' option in setup.cfg

0.1.1 (2011-04-12)
------------------

- Fixed an unhelpful error message when a setup_hook fails to import
- Made d2to1 able to use its own machinery to install itself
