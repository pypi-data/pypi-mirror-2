Description: TaskTracker is an application for managing and organizing tasks
        for groups of people.
        
        It was written at The Open Planning Project for integration with
        OpenCore, on the community action site http://coactivate.org
        
        Installation and Setup
        ======================
        
        Currently TaskTracker only runs on Python2.4
        
        Install ``TaskTracker`` in a contained environment using easy_install::
        
        virtualenv --python=python2.4 /tmp/tt/ve
        source /tmp/tt/ve/bin/activate
        cd /tmp/tt
        easy_install -e -b . TaskTracker
        cd tasktracker
        python setup.py develop
        
        Make a config file::
        
        cp development.example development.ini
        
        Tweak the config file as appropriate. Things you may want to change:
        
        * sqlobject.dburi, database -- these are set to use a mysql db;
        you may want to change them to sqlite to try it out.
        
        * openplans_wrapper -- set this to tasktracker.lib.testing_env:TestingEnv
        unless you are integrating with an OpenCore instance.
        
        The TestingEnv will allow you to log in with any username/password
        combination using HTTP Basic Auth.  Log in as user `admin` to have
        all privileges (for creating new task lists, etc)
        
        Then setup the application::
        
        paster setup-app development.ini#tasktracker
        
        Then you are ready to go::
        
        paster serve development.ini
