        =============
        
        A simple two-phase template rendering application useful for caching of authenticated requests.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        This technique has been desribed by Adrian Holovaty
        [in this blog post](http://www.holovaty.com/writing/django-two-phased-rendering/)
        and previously by Honza Kral. The idea is to first render the template with
        certain blocks denoted as "phased," such that they will not be rendered, and
        will remain valid template code that can be rendered with a second pass.
        
        The second pass fetches the partially-rendered template from the cache and
        performs a second render on it, using RequestContext to provide user-specific
        context to the template. This enables very fast generation of pages that have
        user-specific content, by bypassing the need to use the
        ``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ANONYMOUS_ONLY`` setting.
        
        This implementation uses a secret delimiter that makes it safe against the
        possibility of template code injection vulnerabilities, as it only passes any
        given text through the template parser once. The phased blocks can also contain
        cached context.
        
        Basic Implementation
        --------------------
        
        django-phased contains a templatetag, ``phased``, which defines blocks that
        are to be parsed during the second phase. A middleware class,
        PhasedRenderMiddleware, processes the response to render the parts that were
        skipped during the first rendering.
        
        A special subclass of UpdateCacheMiddleware that drops the "Vary: Cookie"
        header from response when it updates the cache is also included, which, if
        used in place of the standard UpdateCacheMiddleware will prevent the cache
        middleware from varying the cache key based on cookies, thus enabling caching
        of pages in authenticated sessions.
