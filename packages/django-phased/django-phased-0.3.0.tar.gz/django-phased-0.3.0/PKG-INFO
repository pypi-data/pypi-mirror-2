Description: django-phased
        =============
        
        A simple two-phase template rendering application useful for caching of authenticated requests.
        
        django-phased contains a templatetag, ``literal``, which defines blocks that
        are to be parsed during the second phase. A middleware class,
        PhasedRenderMiddleware, processes the response to render the parts that were
        skipped during the first rendering.
        
        A special subclass of UpdateCacheMiddleware that drops the "Vary: Cookie"
        header from response when it updates the cache is also included, which, if
        used in place of the standard UpdateCacheMiddleware will prevent the cache
        middleware from varying the cache key based on cookies, thus enabling caching
        of pages in authenticated sessions.
        
        **More documentation coming soon. For now, please look at the example application.**
