Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Products.VisitTracker provides a simple API for tracking visits on
        objects. Objects for which visits should be tracked have to implement
        the::
        
            Products.VisitTracker.interfaces.IVisitable
        
        interface and thus provide an attribute named *revisit* which defines
        the time delta in hours after which a revisit is tracked as a new visit.
        
        Visits are tracked by the IVisitTracker adapter and stored as annotations
        on the specific object.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Given an object implementing the IVisitable interface tracking and retrieving
        visits is done by adapting to IVisitTracker.
        
        ::
        
            tracker = IVisitTracker(obj)
        
        Tracking a visit
        ----------------
        
        Tracking a visit is done by calling the *trackVisit* method. This is usually
        done in a view or a viewlet.
        
        ::
        
            tracker.trackVisit()
