===========
REST server
===========

Mailman exposes a REST_ HTTP server for administrative control.

The server listens for connections on a configurable host name and port.
Because the REST server has full administrative access, it should always be
run only on localhost, unless you really know what you're doing.  The Mailman
major and minor version numbers are in the URL.

System information can be retrieved from the server.  By default JSON is
returned.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/system')
    http_etag: "..."
    mailman_version: GNU Mailman 3.0... (...)
    python_version: ...
    self_link: http://localhost:8001/3.0/system


Non-existent links
==================

When you try to access a link that doesn't exist, you get the appropriate HTTP
404 Not Found error.

    >>> dump_json('http://localhost:8001/3.0/does-not-exist')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: 404 Not Found
