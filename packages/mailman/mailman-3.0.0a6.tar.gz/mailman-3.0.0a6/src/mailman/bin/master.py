Master sub-process watcher.

Start and watch the configured queue runners and ensure that they stay alive
and kicking.  Each are fork and exec'd in turn, with the master waiting on
their process ids.  When it detects a child queue runner has exited, it may
restart it.

The queue runners respond to SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1 and SIGHUP.  SIGINT,
SIGTERM and SIGUSR1 all cause the qrunners to exit cleanly.  The master will
restart qrunners that have exited due to a SIGUSR1 or some kind of other exit
condition (say because of an exception).  SIGHUP causes the master and the
qrunners to close their log files, and reopen then upon the next printed
message.

The master also responds to SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1 and SIGHUP, which it
simply passes on to the qrunners.  Note that the master will close and reopen
its own log files on receipt of a SIGHUP.  The master also leaves its own
process id in the file `data/master-qrunner.pid` but you normally don't need
