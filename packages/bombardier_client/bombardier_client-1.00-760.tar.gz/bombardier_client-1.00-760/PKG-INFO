Description: Bombardier is a software system that delivers visibility, control
        and automation to datacenter environments. Bombardier provides a means
        for changes to be rolled out to a network of servers in a highly
        controlled way, providing optimum security, logging, centralized
        change control.
        
        This package is called the "Bombardier Client," and its purpose is to
        provide some facilities for the Bombardier Server to make it easier
        for the server to do its job.  If you're a stickler for terminology,
        then, it's not really a client at all, since is not used to connect to
        a server.
