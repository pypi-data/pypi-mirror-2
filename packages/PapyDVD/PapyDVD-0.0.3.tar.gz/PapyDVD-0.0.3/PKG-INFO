Description: Simple application for manage a personal database of movies.
        
        This is based the `repoze.bfg framework`__ and has been tested on MacOS, Windows and Linux systems.
        
        __ http://docs.repoze.org/bfg/current/
        
        How to install
        ==============
        
        Please, read the `installation notes`__ of repoze.bfg documentation.
        
        __ http://docs.repoze.org/bfg/current/narr/install.html
        
        Important notes
        ===============
        
        Even if this is Web application, the target of the application is for personal use, not Web and multi-users.
        
        Development status
        ------------------
        
        This is in a very pre-alpha stage of development.
        
        Language support
        ----------------
        
        The language of the application is **italian**. I really like to make this i18n aware, but for now
        I found great problems with repoze.bfg translations mechanism (poor documentation).
