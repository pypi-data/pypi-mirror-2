Simple application for manage a personal database of movies.

This is based the `repoze.bfg framework`__ and has been tested on MacOS, Windows and Linux systems.

How to install
==============

Please, read the `installation notes`__ of repoze.bfg documentation.

__ http://docs.repoze.org/bfg/current/narr/install.html

Important notes
===============

Even if this is Web application, the target of the application is for personal use, not Web and multi-users.

Development status
------------------

This is in a very pre-alpha stage of development.

Language support
----------------

The language of the application is **italian**. I really like to make this i18n aware, but for now
I found great problems with repoze.bfg translations mechanism (poor documentation).
