Python Seawater
===============

Introduction:
-------------

This module contains a translation of the original CSIRO Matlab package (SEAWATER-3.2) for calculating the properties of sea water.
It consists of a self contained library easy to use. The only requirent is NumPy.

The author has no intention to do things in a "pythonic-way", it is just a "work around" from someone that couldn't afford Matlab anymore.

The package uses the formulas from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO 1981 and UNESCO 1983.
