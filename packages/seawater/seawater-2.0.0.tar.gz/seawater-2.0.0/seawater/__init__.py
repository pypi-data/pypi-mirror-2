Python Seawater
===============

This python package contains:
1) Python translation of the original CSIRO Matlab package (SEAWATER-3.3) for calculating the properties of sea water. The package uses the formulas from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards, UNESCO 1981 and UNESCO 1983.

2) Python translation of the original Gibbs-SeaWater Matlab package (GSW v2.0). The Gibbs-SeaWater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox contains the TEOS-10 subroutines for evaluating the thermodynamic properties of pure water (using IAPWS-09) and seawater (using IAPWS-08 for the saline part).

The author has no intention to do things in a "pythonic-way", it is just a "work around" from someone that couldn't afford Matlab anymore.

CAVEAT: These modules do not adhere to strict basic-SI units but rather oceanographic units are adopted.

Sea pressure is absolute pressure - 10.1325 dbar (or minus atmospheric pressure)
"""

"""
For the first time the influence of the spatially varying composition of seawater can be systematically taken into account through the use of Absolute Salinity. In the open ocean, this has a non-trivial effect on the horizontal density gradient, and thereby on the ocean velocities and heat transports calculated via the thermal wind relationship.
"""

"""
The new salinity variable, Absolute Salinity, is measured in SI units (e.g. g/kg).
"""

"""
The thermodynamic quantities available from TEOS-10 are totally consistent with each other, while this was not the case with EOS-80
"""

"""
The new equation incorporates a more accurate representation of salinity known as Absolute Salinity. The main justification for preferring Absolute Salinity over the most recent salinity definition, Practical Salinity, is that the thermodynamic properties of seawater are directly influenced by the total mass of dissolved constituents (Absolute Salinity). However, the mass of dissolved constituents are regionally variable and are not always accurately represented when using conductivity measurements of seawater, the key parameter used in the calculation of Practical Salinity.
"""

"""
In addition, it would be useful to have a conservative tracer for salinity. The Absolute Salinity SA is not conservative, because it slowly increases in the ocean due to biogeochemical processes, which remineralize carbon and nutrients. The Reference Salinity SR is also not conservative, since it is measured with conductivity which will also slowly increase due to these increases in concentrations of nutrient and carbon system ions.

However, we can "remove" these effects and construct a conservative salinity tracer Sstar..

Typically this PREFORMED SALINITY Sstar will equal SR (and SA) in Standard Seawater (SSW), but as ions are added it will become smaller than either SR and SA (as illustrated by the example in Table 1).
"""

"""
CT == \BigTheta = frac{h_o}{C^o_p}.

The scale factor C^o_p is a constant carefully chosen so that potential temperature \smalltheta and Conservative Temperature \BigTheta will be numerically similar for typical seawater at SP = 35, or near t = 0 degC. However, the difference between the two can exceed 1â—¦C when salinities are low and temperatures high (for details, see IOC et al., 2010).
