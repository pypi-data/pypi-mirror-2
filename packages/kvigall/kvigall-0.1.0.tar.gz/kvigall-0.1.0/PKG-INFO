Description: 
        =======
        kvigall
        =======
        
        kvigall is a calendar program capable of showing calendars created
        from scripts that you create. If there's a site that you often check
        for upcoming events, you can create a script that crawls and parses
        this site. By converting your resulted data into a format
        understandable by kvigall, you can then view the info in a calendar.
        
        kvigall currently has two calendars:
        
        * one using curses (default)
        * one just printing to the terminal (called 'text')
        
        kvigall caches events to make loading faster and easier. This also
        makes it possible to read events from a script that depends on a
        connection to the internet even if there is no connection.

        Installing
        ==========
        
        Way #1
        ------
        Just run this (requires that you have python-setuptools installed)::
        
        $ sudo easy_install kvigall
        
        Way #2
        ------
        Get the newest version of kvigall at
        http://metanohi.org/projects/kvigall/ or at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/kvigall
        
        Extract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::
        
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        Python 2.5+ is probably a requirement.
        
        Optional extras
        ---------------
        If present, kvigall will use these Python modules:
        
        ``qvikconfig``
        + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/qvikconfig/
        + License: GPLv3+
        + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install qvikconfig``
        + Author: Niels Serup
        
        ``termcolor``
        + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor/
        + License: GPLv3+
        + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install termcolor``
        + Author: Konstantin Lepa <konstantin lepa at gmail com>
        
        ``htmlentitiesdecode``
        + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/htmlentitiesdecode/
        + License: WTFPL 2.0+
        + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install htmlentitiesdecode``
        + Author: Niels Serup
        
        (Copies of ``qvikconfig``, ``termcolor`` and ``htmlentitiesdecode``
        are included in the kvigall distribution, so you'll be fine without
        downloading them yourselves.)
        
        ``setproctitle``
        + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/
        + License: New BSD License
        + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install setproctitle``
        + Author: Daniele Varrazzo <daniele varrazzo at gmail com>
        
        
        Using
        =====
        
        To use kvigall after installation, run ``kvigall``. To get an
        impression of its options, run ``kvigall --help``.
        
        kvigall works by using mods. These mods are ordinary Python
        programs. Every mod must have a ``Connector`` class with a
        ``get_kvigall_events`` function returning a list of kvigall events (by
        importing ``Event`` from ``kvigall.various``). If you create a script
        called ``simple_mod.py`` and place it in your scripts directory
        ($HOME/.kvigall by default), you can call it from kvigall by running
        ``kvigall simple_mod``.
        
        This distribution includes a basic ``simple_mod.py``, which can be
        used as a base when developing new mods. Other mods are available on
        the internet; see http://metanohi.org/projects/kvigall/mods/ for a
        list of some of the downloadable and usable mods in existence.
        
        kvigall can use config files instead of just command line options. All
        of these options can be overridden on the command line. It is possible
        to have several config files, using different ones for different
        purposes. Run ``kvigall --help`` for available config file options and
        their equivalent command line options. A config file might look like
        this::
        
        default scripts = simple_mod # Using simple_mod.py
        frontend = curses:navigate # Use the default frontend, but make it
        # begin in navigate-mode instead of command-mode
        #frontend = text # I want the plain text frontend
        #styling = false # *really* plain text
        date format = '%A, %m/%d-%Y' # e.g. Friday, 08/27-2010
        start date = ++0 # If today has no events, search for an eventful date
        # in the future
        #update after = 1d # I want a longer-lasting cache
        #start date = 2010, 01, 01 # instead of today
        #start empty = true # nah, don't show anything at startup
        #verbose = false # I hate errors, don't print 'em
        #color errors = false # no colored errors
        
        Your main config file should be called "kvigall.config" and saved in
        the same directory as your scripts. All text after the '#' character
        is comment-matter.
        
        Built-in frontends
        ------------------
        
        kvigall comes with two frontends: a text-based one and a curses-based
        one. To get an impression on how these frontends work, enter "help"
        when running either of them. This command will display a help message.
        
        
        Developing
        ==========
        
        kvigall is written in Python and uses Git for branches. To get the
        latest branch, get it from gitorious.org like this::
        
        $ git clone git://gitorious.org/kvigall/kvigall.git
        
        A number of kvigall mods can be fetched using git as well::
        
        $ git clone git://gitorious.org/kvigall/kvigall-mods.git
        
        
        The future/TODOs
        ================
        
        This is an incomplete list of what isn't perfect yet.
        
        * The current way of saving caches is crude. It uses too many
        files and should be improved.
        * There is no support for user-created frontends. This should be
        fixed.
