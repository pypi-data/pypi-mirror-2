Blaze Command Helper (BCH)
=======

A framework that facilitates shell and batch scripting in Python. You can also install
the `in-development version
<http://bitbucket.org/rsyring/blazech/get/tip.gz#egg=blazech-dev>`_ of BCH with
``easy_install blazech==dev``.

Config File Example

Usage
---------

Concepts
---------

* Action:
    - a python class that implements the Action API
    - accomplishes a real task (backups a database, sends an email, etc.)
* Job
    - defined in a section in a config file
    - has one and only one action
    - has settings associated with said action
* Batch: the process kicked off by a call to the blazech script
    - can be based off one or more config files
    - is made up of one or more jobs

Logging Levels
-----------------

these levels apply to console output and the log file and are set seperately.
Console output is set using the verbose or quite flags (shown in parentheses)
and log file verbosity is set using the configuring setting 'logfile.verbosity'

* none (-q) = output nothing
* minimal (default) = output basic status updates (batch and job start/stop) and non-verbose errors
* info (-v) = output more detailed status updates (job internals, statistics)
* debug (-vv) = debugging for end users (verbose + commands that are run (MAYBE INCLUDING PASSWORDS), command output, stack traces)
* vdebug (-vvv) = verbose debugging, includes blazech internals


Thanks & Credits
------------------

To the `pip project <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>` for a lot of the boiler
plate code to get the package up and running and for testing ideas.

Includes ConfigParser.py from the standard lib of Python 2.6.4.
