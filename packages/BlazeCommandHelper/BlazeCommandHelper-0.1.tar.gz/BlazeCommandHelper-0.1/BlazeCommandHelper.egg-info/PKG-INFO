        Introduction
        ---------------
        
        BlazeCommandHelper (BCH) is a framework that facilitates the quick creation of
        shell and batch scripts.  It provides a core command (bch) which locates
        sub-commands from system dirs, user dirs, and installed python packages
        (through the "blazech.commands" endpoint).
        
        Features
        ---------------
        
        * locates plugin commands from various places
        * provides logging facilities
        * provides configuration file facilities (needs work)
        
        The goal is to have an API that facilitates interaction between the environment,
        command line options, and configuration files ala `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/configuration.html>`_.
        
        Usage
        ---------------
        
        Install BCH using easy_install or pip.  Once installed, create a file for your
        first command:
        
            # *nix: ~/.blazech/command_hwp.py
            # %APPDATA%\.blazech\command_hwp.py
            from blazech.commands import BaseCommand
        
            class Command(BaseCommand):
                name = 'hello-world'
                help = 'say hello'
        
                def create_arguments(self):
                    #self.parser is the argparse parser for this sub-command
                    self.parser.add_argument(
                        '-n', '--name',
                        help='who do you want to say hello to',
                        default='world'
                    )
        
                def execute(self, args):
                    print 'hello %s' % args.name
        
        to run:
        
            # bch -h
            usage: bch [-h] [-v] [-q] {hello-world} ...
        
            positional arguments:
              {hello-world}
                hello-world     say hello
            <...snip...>
        
            $ bch hello-world
            hello world
        
            $ bch hello-world -n foo
            hello foo

        Current Status
        ---------------
        
        Primary use cases work for me, but b/c of time constraints will probably move
        forward slowly.
        
        The `development version <http://bitbucket.org/rsyring/blazech/get/tip.zip#egg=BlazeCommandHelper-dev>`_
        is installable with ``easy_install BlazeCommandHelper==dev``.
