Description: EOL fixer script
        ================
        
        
        What the script does
        --------------------
        
        The script goes through a directory structure and fixes non-native EOL endings
        in non-binary files.  So the windows line endings are gone if you work on
        linux (and probably vice versa, though I didn't try).
        
        Numerous people forget to set native EOL line endings by default in their main
        svn config file (see `zope's svn explanation
        <http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Subversion/SubversionConfigurationForLineEndings>`_
        why this is something you need to do).
        
        The script sets the related svn property ``eol-style`` to native when not set
        yet.
        
        
        History and origin
        ------------------
        
        Original script (and thus 99% of the functionality) is from Holger Krekel from
        the `pypy project <http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/>`_.
        
        A couple of years ago I got a script from Guido Wesdorp for cleaning up EOL
        styles in svn.  I've long kept a private (modified) copy of that file and only
        later found out that it was from the pypy project:
        http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/tool/fixeol .
        
        Some changes to the original script:
        
        - Couple of extra file extensions that are checked (like ``.zcml`` and
          ``.ini`` files and also ``_tmpl`` files like in paster skeletons).
        
        - Some code cleanup and optimisation.
        
        - Added a setup.py and a console_scripts entry point to make it
          easy_installable.
