Description: 
        Roadmap
        ========
        
        Roadmap is a routing library powered by regular expressions. Roadmap was
        created to quickly map large amounts of input to functions. In the particular
        case that sparked Roadmap's development, I was writing an IRC bot and I wanted
        a fast (to code and to execute) way to map input strings to functions. Beyond an
        IRC bot, I could also picture Roadmap being used to process data from a web API,
        user input, a socket, or really any stream of data.
