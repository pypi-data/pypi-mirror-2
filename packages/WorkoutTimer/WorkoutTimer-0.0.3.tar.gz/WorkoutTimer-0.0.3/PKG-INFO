Description: ==========
        Workout Timer
        ==========
        
        I created Workout Timer because I couldn't find a suitable interval-based routine, and wanted a good way to time my Spartacus-based workout.  Currently, editing the difficulty must be done by editing the variable manually workout_timer.py.
        
        Currently only tested under Linux, I suppose it may run under OSX, and probably not on Windows.  If I have time, I'll eventually get around to fixing this.
        
        Special thanks to Brandon Thomson (http://changelog.bthomson.com) for inspiring me to write this.
