Workout Timer
==========

I created Workout Timer because I couldn't find a suitable interval-based routine, and wanted a good way to time my Spartacus-based workout.  Currently, editing the difficulty must be done by editing the variable manually workout_timer.py.

Currently only tested under Linux, I suppose it may run under OSX, and probably not on Windows.  If I have time, I'll eventually get around to fixing this.

Special thanks to Brandon Thomson (http://changelog.bthomson.com) for inspiring me to write this.
