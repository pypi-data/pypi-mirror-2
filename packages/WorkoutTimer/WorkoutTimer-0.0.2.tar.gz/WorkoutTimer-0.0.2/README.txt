Workout Timer
==========

I created Workout Timer because I couldn't find a suitable interval-based routine, and wanted a good way to time my Spartacus-based workout.  Currently, editing the difficulty must be done by editing the variable manually workout_timer.py.

Usage is extremely simple, with the command line.
./workout_timer.py

Special thanks to Brandon Thomson (http://changelog.bthomson.com) for inspiring me to write this.
