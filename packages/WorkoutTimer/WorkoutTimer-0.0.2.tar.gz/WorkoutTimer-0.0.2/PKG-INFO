Description: ==========
        Workout Timer
        ==========
        
        I created Workout Timer because I couldn't find a suitable interval-based routine, and wanted a good way to time my Spartacus-based workout.  Currently, editing the difficulty must be done by editing the variable manually workout_timer.py.
        
        Usage is extremely simple, with the command line.
        ./workout_timer.py
