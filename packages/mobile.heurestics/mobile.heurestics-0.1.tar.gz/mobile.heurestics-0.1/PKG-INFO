Description: This package contains heurestics (rules-of-thumbs) for dealing with mobile phones in web systems.
        
        Heurestics are divided to two categories
        
        * Self-contained: Rules are applied based on plain HTTP headers. User agent matching
        is self-contained and done dummily (if "iPhone" in user_agent...).
        This is dominating category.
        
        * User agent based: *mobile.sniffer* Python package and mobile device database is needed
        to apply heurestics.
