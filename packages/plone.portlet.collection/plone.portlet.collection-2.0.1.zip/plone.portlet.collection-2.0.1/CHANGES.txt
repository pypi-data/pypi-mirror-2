Changelog
=========

2.0.1 - 2011-01-03
------------------

* Add Site Administrator to the default roles for the
  "plone.portlet.collection: Add collection portlet" permission, for forward
  compatibility with Plone 4.1.
  [davisagli]

* Removed bug where a resultset with fewer items than limit wasn't randomized.
  [jaroel]

* Removed Plone 3 specific implementation in favor of a generic one.
  [jaroel]

* Fixed returning optional randomized results in the collection
  portlet.  This happened on Plone 4; if this makes the portlet too
  slow for you, you should switch off the randomizing.
  [maurits]

* Fixed wrong exception handling in random collection portlet that
  failed to catch an IndexError.
  [maurits]

2.0 - 2010-07-18
----------------

* Update license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]

* Add fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9198 so that
  typeUseViewActionInListings is respected.
  [aaronv]

* Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
  msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
  This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.
  [vincentfretin]

  restrictedTraverse always gets a string and not Unicode.
