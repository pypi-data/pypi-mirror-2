Installation
============

* Add ``collective.imagetags`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.imagetags

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.imagetags

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
