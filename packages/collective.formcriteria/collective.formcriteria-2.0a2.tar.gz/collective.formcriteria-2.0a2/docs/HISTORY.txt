Changelog
=========

2.0a2 - 2010-11-23

* Fixed a problem with a faulty type assumption regarding
  DateTimeFields in the FormDateCriterion.  The FormDateCriterion
  doesn't actually used a DateTimeField.
  [rossp]

  conflict with other uses of the full "navigation" macro within an
  existing form resulting in nested <form>s.
  [rossp]

------------------

* Ensure that the "default" profile is used by portal_quickinstaller
  by... well, default.  :-)

  batch_macros to prevent "uri too long" errors when using paging with
  many form criteria.

* Use method="post" for the criteria form to address "uri too long"
  when lots of form criteria are used.  Reported by mauro and
  confirmed to happen with just two date fields.
  [rossp]

  skin template.
  [seletz]
