Description: Stirimango is an anagram for "migrations"
        
        Database migrations solve the painful process of dealing with updates to the
        schema of a database.  The concept is not new, as the authors originally were
        introduced the concept working with Ruby on Rails.  Stirimango is a Python
        implementation of migrations.  Stirimango is unlike newer versions of Rails in
        that it does not provide an ORM layer -- it deals only in raw SQL.
        
        More specifically, Stirimango is written for Python 3 and uses the
        :mod:`postgresql` module to manipulate the PostgreSQL RDBMS.  With little
        modification, Stirimango could be used with other database systems; however, the
        author only uses PostgreSQL.
