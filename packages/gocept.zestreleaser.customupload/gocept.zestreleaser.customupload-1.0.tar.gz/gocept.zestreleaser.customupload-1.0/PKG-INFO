Description: ===================
         Custom egg upload
        ===================
        
        This package provides a plugin for ``zest.releaser`` that offers to upload the
        released egg via SCP to a custom location (instead of / in addition to PyPI).
        
        To use, add a section to your ``~/.pypirc`` like so::
        
            [gocept.zestreleaser.customupload]
            gocept = download.gocept.com:/var/www/packages
            gocept.special = download.gocept.com:/var/www/special-packages
        
        If the package being released starts with one of the keys in that section
        (longest match wins), you will be prompted whether to upload the egg (that was
        created by zest.releaser by checking out the tag) to the given server.
