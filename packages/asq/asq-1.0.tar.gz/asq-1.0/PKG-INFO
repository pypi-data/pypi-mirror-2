Description: ``asq`` is simple implementation of a LINQ-inspired API for Python which
        operates over Python iterables, including a parallel version implemented in
        terms of the Python standard library multiprocessing module.
        
        What It Does
        ============
        
        ``asq`` is a package implementing queries over iterables of Python
        objects.  `asq` provides a fluent interface making extensive use of method
        chaining to create complex queries without compromising readability.  For
        example, to take the first five uppercased results from a list of words sorted
        by length and then alphabetically, try::
        
        >>> from asq import query
        >>> words = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten"]
        >>> query(words).order_by(len).then_by().take(5).select(str.upper).to_list()
        ['ONE', 'SIX', 'TEN', 'TWO', 'FIVE']
        
        Over 40 standard query operators are provided together with various utilities
        to make the API even more convenient to use in Python.
        
        How to get it
        =============
        
        ``asq`` is available on the Python Package Index and can be installed with
        easy_install from setuptools::
        
        $ easy_install asq
        
        Alternatively you can download and unpack the source distribution (link to the
        left) and install using::
        
        $ cd asq-1.0
        $ python setup.py install
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        This version of ``asq`` works with Python 2.6 and higher, including Python 3.
        It has been tested on Python 2.6, Python 2.7, Python 3.1 and Python 3.2.
        Furthermore it is tested on !IronPython 2.6 and !IronPython 2.7.
        
        ``asq`` has a dependency on the ordereddict module which ships as standard
        with Python 2.7 and upwards, but this module must be installed separately
        for Python 2.6.
