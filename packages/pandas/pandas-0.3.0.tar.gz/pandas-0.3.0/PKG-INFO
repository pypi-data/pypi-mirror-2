Description: 
        pandas provides NumPy-based data structures and statistical tools for
        common time series and cross-sectional data sets. It is intended to
        accomplish the following:
        
        * Simplify working with possibly labeled 1, 2, and 3 dimensional
          heterogeneous data sets commonly found in statistics, finance, and
          econometrics.
        
        * Provide tools for working with dates, fixed-frequency custom date
          ranges, and other necessary time series functionality
        
        * Provide IO utilities for getting data in and out of pandas
        
        * Implement common statistical and time series functionality with a
          convenient interface, handling missing data and other common
          problems associated with messy statistical data sets
