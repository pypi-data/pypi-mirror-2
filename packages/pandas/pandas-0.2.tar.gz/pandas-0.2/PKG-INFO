Description: 
        pandas provides NumPy-based data structures and statistical tools for
        common time series and cross-sectional data sets. It is intended to
        accomplish the following:
        
        * Simplify working with possibly labeled 1, 2, and 3 dimensional
        heterogeneous data sets commonly found in statistics, finance, and
        econometrics.
        
        * Provide IO utilities for getting data in and out of pandas
        
        * Implement common statistical models with a convenient interface,
        handling missing data and other common problems associated with
        messy statistical data sets
