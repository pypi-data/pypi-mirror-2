Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.portlet.recentactivity provides a Portlet and a Viewlet
        with Facebook like entries on recent user activities, e.g. "the
        user admin added 'News Item 1' to 'News' 10 minutes ago".
        
        By default, the Recent Activity Viewlet is not registered. If you want
        to register it, for example below your content, you have to add this
        code to your configure.zcml::
        
        <browser:viewlet
        name="collective.portlet.recentactivity.RecentActivityViewlet"
        manager="plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IBelowContentBody"
        class=".viewlet.RecentActivityViewlet"
        permission="zope2.View"
        />
        
        
        Buildout Installation
        =====================
        
        To install collective.portlet.recentactivity, add the following code
        to your buildout.cfg::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.portlet.recentactivity
        
        ...
        
        zcml =
        ...
        collective.portlet.recentactivity
        
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        The log entries only work for Archetype content types. Though, it
        should be fairly easy to replace the Archetype specific event handlers
        with ones that work for other types of content.
