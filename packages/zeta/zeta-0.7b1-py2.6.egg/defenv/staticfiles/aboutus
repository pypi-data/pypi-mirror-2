=== Why we engineered this tool

There are several reasons why we wanted a tool like this. A few of
them are listed here,

* A generic bug / effort tracking tool that can be tailored to our needs.
* A flexible, version controlled document application, enabling multiple users
  to collaborate in writing documents.
* Support for multiple projects without complicating user's participation in
  projects.
* A permission system, that is simple yet flexible.
* Full integration with favorite editors, email server(s) and version control system.
* Data analytics, for projects as well as for source code.

We hope to cover all our needs in near future along with others. So, do send an
[[ mailto:support@discoverzeta.com | email ]] letting us know what you think.
And yes, we know that there are several similar tools out there in the market. For us,
there were reasons for not picking one of them, but for you, we hope there
will be a reason to pick ours for yourself.
