== ZWiki Extensions

ZWiki Extension is a plugin like framework to extend wiki engine itself. One
can define markups, text formats etc ... and integrate it with ZWiki as an
extension.

=== Extension Framework

Extented wiki text can be added into the main document by enclosing them within
triple curly braces '' }} ''. Everything between the curly braces
are passed directly to the extension module, which, in most of the cases will
return a translated HTML text. The general format while using a wiki extension
is,

> [<PRE
{{{<b>extension-name</b> <em>space seperated parameter-strings</em>
# { '<b>property-name</b>' : '<b>value</b>'
#   '<b>property-name</b>' : '<b>value</b>'
#   <b>...</b>
# }

<b>wiki-text ...</b>

}}}
>]

* ''extension-name'', should be one of the valid extensions.
* ''parameter-strings'', string values that will be passed as parameters.
* ''property-name'', property name can be a property accepted by the extension
  module or can be CSS property. Note that, the entire property block should
  be marked by a beginning ''hash (#)''
