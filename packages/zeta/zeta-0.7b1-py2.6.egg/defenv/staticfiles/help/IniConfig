== Configuring application via ``{c} ini`` file 

While installing the application, its distribution / installation
manual would have encouraged few configurations to the ini-file. The ini-file
itself is created as part of application setup. Most of the
ini configuration can subsequently done via web, by site administrator, at
``{g} site-admin->SiteConfig ``

* ''Note that, where ever ``{g} %(here)s `` is found in the option value, it
  expands to absolute path that contains the .ini file''
* ''If a path value starts with ``{g}/`` then it is relative to''
  ''zeta.public_dir'' value
* ''Boolean values can be entered as //{g}True// or //{g}False// string
  literals ''

=== [app:zetapylons]
// Zeta application configuration //

Once setup, the following table of configuration need not be changed again.

{{{ Nested 
# { 'margin-left' : '40px' }

}}}

==== Setup time configuration

The following table of configuration are done during setup time.

{{{ Nested 
# { 'margin-left' : '40px' }

|= option            |=  value(s)           |= Remarks
|  zeta.envpath      | %(here)s/defenv      | Environment directory
|  zeta.sitelogo     | /sitelogo            | Site's Logo image
|  zeta.public_dir   |                      | Public directory, to fetch static files
|  zeta.template_dir |                      | Template dir for page templates
|  cache_dir         | %(here)s/defenv/data | Directory to cache data
|  xapian.storepath  | %(here)s/defenv/data/xapian | Directory to store xapian search indexes
|  zeta.zetalink     | http://discoverzeta.com   | Link to zeta website
|  zeta.zetalogo     | /zeta-110x45.jpg     | Zeta logo
|  zeta.siteadmin    | admin     | Site administrator's user-name
|  zeta.timezone     | UTC       | Time zone for the site

|  zeta.tckccodes    | %(here)s/defenv/public/tckccodes.json  | Ticket color codes
|  zeta.tckfilters   | %(here)s/defenv/public/tckfilters.pyd  | Ticket standard filters

}}}

: zeta.envpath ::
    When this option is changed to something else, make sure that, 
    ''public_dir'', ''cache_dir'', ''xapian.storepath'', ''zeta.mstnccodes'',
    ''zeta.tckccodes'', ''zeta.tckfilters'', ''beaker.session.data_dir'' points
    to subdirectories inside the environment directory, that way,
    application's side effects on the hard-disk will be confined to a single
    directory and its sub-directory.
: zeta.sitelogo ::
    copy site logo image file into the public/ directory. It can also be
    configured via // zeta.public_dir // option.
: zeta.public_dir ::
    If left to default will point to ''%(here)/defenv/public''

Administrators may need to adjust ''zeta.envpath'' option, to set the
environment directory for the application, and ''sitelogo'' option, to
configure the logo image.
Other options, including ''zeta.hdisclaimer'' should be left to its default
values.

==== Run time configuration

The following options can be configured during setup time and modified any time
later.

{{{ Nested 
# { 'margin-left' : '40px' }

|= option             |=  value(s)           |= Remarks

|  zeta.enabletline   | Boolean  | Enable timeline
|  zeta.fasttline     | Boolean  | Enable fast timeline
|  zeta.xapiansearch  | Boolean  | Enable search indexing

}}}

: zeta.pageheader :: 
    Disabling pageheader will remove site-logo, project-logo and the entire
    block of html element.
: zeta.webanalytics ::
    Typically webanalytics tool will provide a code snippet that should be
    included in all pages. Store the snippet in a file under the
    environment directory and specify the path here. Path will look
    something like, \\ [<PRE %(here)s/defenv/public/googleanalytics.html >]
    If successfully configured,  analytics code-snippet will be included in
    all pages.

===== Mail configuration

Zeta has SMTP and POP3 clients,
[[ /help/MailClient | learn more about email and notification ]].
Since each project created under the site requires its own mail account, it
is imperative for the application to be able to create database entries for
each project mail account. That is why, ''zeta.smtpmysql.url'' is required. It
typically looks like,
    > [<PRE mysql://mail_admin:smtp321@127.0.0.1:3306/mailprovider >]

''zeta.smtp_user'' and ''zeta.smtp_password'' options provide the mail account
that is already created for the site. The ``domain-name`` part provided in
//zeta.smtp_user// option is taken as the host name on which the application is
visible to outside world. Other ''zeta.smtpmysql.*'' configurations are
specific to sqlalchemy to interface with maildb.

==== Via web configuration

Most of the following options can be configured during setup time and
subsequently via web. Note that once the application is setup, the ini file's
configuration values may not be considered.

{{{ Nested

==== Miscellaneous configuration options

===== authkit.cookie.includeip
    It is a boolean value (//True// or //False//). If configured as //True//,
    the client's ip address will be used while computing the authentication
    cookie. This provides added security, since, subsequent requests from the
    client will be authenticated (using cookie hash) only when it comes from
    the same IP address, that way even if the auth-cookie is copied to another
    browser running in a different machine, authentication will fail.
    ''Do not enable this, if you expect your client to dynamically change IP
    address (like ISPs)''
