Master sokochi, to developer,

{{{ Nested
# { 'margin-left' : '50px' }

// "how do you write ?" //

// "With an object oriented document editor" //

// "With characters !!" //

// "How do you highlight characters ?" //

// "I type the character, select them, click the bold button" //

// " ~''characters~'' !!" //
}}}


While the master was meditating, with his students, a passerby shot a
question,

{{{ Nested
# { 'margin-left' : '50px' }

//  "What is this noise about project management ?" //

after a brief silence, a student murmured,
// "Ask the right question" //

the passerby thought for a moment, and asked again,
// "What is project and collaboration ?" //

master,
// "watching, listening, learning, teaching and doing,
   with a bit of tracking and digging" //

After the passerby is gone, master looking at his students,
// "what is project collaboration ?" //

// "it is watching, listening, learning, teaching and doing, with a bit of
   tracking and digging" //

master,
// "it is that, which is being written, which can be learned" //
}}}

A stressed student comes to master,
{{{ Nested
# { 'margin-left' : '50px' }
// "What have you been doing ?" //

// "Browsing" //

// "What did you learn ?" //

// "Every-thing is linked to every-other-thing." //

// "What did you learn ?" //

// "I keep moving from one to another, never finding what I want" //

// "What did you learn ?" //

// "I should know what I want, remember the right keywords. And search" //
}}}

[<Q
Un-clutter your mind to invent better,
   un-cluttering and inventing is akin to forgetting and remembering

Allow others to remember what you need to forget,
  forgetting becomes easier as much as remembering becomes easier

So, it goes without saying,
  Document your ideas
  Commit your source
  Review both
  Learn to track
