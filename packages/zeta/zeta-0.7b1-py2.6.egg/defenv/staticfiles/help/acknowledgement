List of tools, libraries and other creative works used to build Zeta,

: Apache2 ::
    http://httpd.apache.org/ \\ 
    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
    open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
    Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
    extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current
    HTTP standards.
: AuthKit ::
    http://authkit.org/ \\ 
    Built for WSGI applications and middleware - Sophisticated and extensible
    permissions system - Built in support for HTTP basic, HTTP digest, form,
    cookie and OpenID authentication methods plus others - Easily define
    users, passwords and roles - Designed to be totally extensible so you can
    use the components to integrate with a database, LDAP connection or your
    own custom system - Plays nicely with the Pylons web framework.
: Bazaar ::
    http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/ \\ 
    Bazaar is a version control system that helps you track project history
    over time and to collaborate easily with others. Whether you're a single
    developer, a co-located team or a community of developers scattered across
    the world, Bazaar scales and adapts to meet your needs. Part of the GNU
    Project, Bazaar is free software sponsored by Canonical. 
: Beaker ::
    http://beaker.groovie.org/ \\ 
    Beaker is a library for caching and sessions for use with web applications
    and stand-alone Python scripts and applications. It comes with WSGI
    middleware  for easy drop-in use with WSGI  based web applications, and
    caching decorators for ease of use with any Python based application.
: Graphviz ::
    http://www.graphviz.org/ \\ 
    Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as
    diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. Automatic graph drawing has many
    important applications in software engineering, database and web design,
    networking, and in visual interfaces for many other domains. 
: Highcharts ::
    http://www.highcharts.com/ \\ 
    Highcharts is a charting library written in pure JavaScript, offering an
    easy way of adding interactive charts to your web site or web application.
    Highcharts currently supports line, spline, area, areaspline, column, bar,
    pie and scatter chart types.
: Mako ::
    http://www.makotemplates.org/ \\ 
    Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,
    non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance.
    Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others,
    including Django templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually,
    Mako is an embedded Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which
    refines the familiar ideas of componentized layout and inheritance to
    produce one of the most straightforward and flexible models available,
    while also maintaining close ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.
: Mysql ::
    http://www.mysql.com/ \\ 
    MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that runs as a
    server providing multi-user access to a number of databases.
: MySQL_python ::
    http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/ \\ 
    Python binding for mysql database
: nose ::
    http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.3/ \\ 
    Unit test framework
: Paste ::
    http://pythonpaste.org/ \\ 
    Python Paste, often simply called paste, is a set of utilities for web
    development in Python. Paste has been described as "a framework for web
    frameworks".
: ply ::
    http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ \\ 
    In a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc
    implementation. Here is a list of its essential features.
    It's implemented entirely in Python - It uses LR-parsing which is
    reasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars - PLY provides
    most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for empty
    productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for ambiguous
    grammars - PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error
    checking - PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less than provide the
    basic lex/yacc functionality. In other words, it's not a large parsing
    framework or a component of some larger system
: Pygments ::
    http://pygments.org/ \\ 
    Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of
    software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to
    prettify source code.
: Pylons ::
    http://pylonshq.com/ \\ 
    Pylons combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl,
    providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework.
    It's also one of the first projects to leverage the emerging WSGI
    standard, which allows extensive re-use and flexibility - but only if
    you need it. Out of the box, Pylons aims to make web development fast,
    flexible and easy.
: Python  ::
    http://www.python.org/ \\ 
    Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and
    integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and
    see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.
: SVN ::
    http://subversion.apache.org/ \\ 
    Subversion is an open source version control system. Founded in 2000 by
    CollabNet, Inc., the Subversion project and software have seen incredible
    success over the past decade. Subversion has enjoyed and continues to
    enjoy widespread adoption in both the open source arena and the corporate
    world.
: Python-virtualenv ::
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv \\ 
    virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments.
: Routes ::
    http://routes.groovie.org/ \\
    Routes is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for mapping
    URLs to application actions, and conversely to generate URLs. Routes makes it
    easy to create pretty and concise URLs that are RESTful with little effort.
    Routes allows conditional matching based on domain, cookies, HTTP method, or a
    custom function. Sub-domain support is built in. Routes comes with an
    extensive unit test suite.
: simplejson ::
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/ \\ 
    simplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible JSON
    <http://json.org> encoder and decoder for Python 2.5+. It is pure Python
    code with no dependencies, but includes an optional C extension for a
    serious speed boost.
: SQLAlchemy ::
    http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ \\ 
    SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that
    gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
    It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence
    patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access,
    adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.
: Tempita ::
    http://pythonpaste.org/tempita/ \\
    String templating tool
: Xapian ::
    http://xapian.org/ \\ 
    Xapian is an Open Source Search Engine Library, released under the GPL.
    It's written in C++, with bindings to allow use from Perl, Python, PHP,
    Java, Tcl, C# and Ruby (so far!)
    Xapian is a highly adaptable toolkit which allows developers to easily add
    advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications. It
    supports the Probabilistic Information Retrieval model and also supports a
    rich set of boolean query operators.
