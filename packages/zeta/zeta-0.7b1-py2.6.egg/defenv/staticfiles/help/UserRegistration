=== Users

To create a user account ,one should first register with the site. User registration
Can be configured to be through online registration or registration by invitation. 
Every request to application server is processed in the context of a user, if
a request is from un-authenticated user, the user will be marked
//anonymous//. There is also a special user called //admin// who is the site
administrator,

Special users
: anonymous :: If the request is from //un-authenticated// sources.
: admin :: User who has //un-restricted// access to entire site.

==== Site administrator

The //admin// user gets unrestricted access to entire site. The site administrator
can also,

* Configure the application.
* Manage users by enabling or disabling them.
* Manage projects by enabling or disabling them.
* Access to project administration page for every project created in the site.
* Create and manage different license that can subsequently be used for projects.
* Create project teams.
* Group permissions and assign them to users / project-teams.

=== Online User Registration 

There is a fairly simple user registration process, whereby, anybody can
register themselves by providing basic information like,

  * username, password
  * email
  * timezone

Registration is ofcourse protected with captcha images.

==== User Registration by invitation

For sites that are not open to all, and for those who prefer viral marketing
for their project sites, there is an option for user registration by
invitation. This can be enabled by site-admin ( ``{c}admin`` ) under
//site-admin->siteconfig// page.

In this option, site-administrator or any registered user (again based on how
the site is configured) can invite a person to join the site. Only invited
users can choose to register themselves.

''Steps involved in user registration by invitation''

# Site administrator or any registered user (based on site configuration) can 
use ''/u/inviteuser'' link, to send out invitation email.
# Invitation email will contain a unique URL, following which invitee can 
register themself.
# Once invitee accepts invitation and registers, the invitation will be
considered met.

==== Maintenance

Inevitably, a site which uses a two-step process for user invitation-registration
might accumulate, over a period of time, a huge number of invitations in the
database. This can be managed and cleaned up using the paster admin script.
