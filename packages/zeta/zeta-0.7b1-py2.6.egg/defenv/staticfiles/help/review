=== Code collaboration

[<Q
Code review is systematic examination (often as peer review) of computer
source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial
development phase, improving both the overall quality of software and the
developers' skills. >]

Ideally, review process is not just restricted to source code and not a one
time process. The biggest criticism on //review process// is that,
formal code reviews have required a considerable investment in preparation
for the review event and execution time.

From Zeta's point of view, we do not look at //review// as a process, but as a
habit, around which the tool is designed, enabling developers to spend
their quality time improving the quality of code. As the saying goes,
    [<Q more the number of eye balls, better the quality of code >]
In Zeta, review can be done as an on-going process, instead of a formal event.

=== Specifying resource

Review entries can be created only under project's context. Each new review
should be specified with ''resource-url'' being reviewed and its
''version number''.

: Review wiki documents ::
    To create a review request for wiki document hosted under a project,
    specify its url path, and wiki-page version number. For eg, if wiki-page
    by name //Installation// under the project, //zeta// is to be reviewed,
    specify the url as,
    [<PRE /p/zeta/wiki/Installation >]
    and mention the latest version of the wiki-page as the //version number//.
: Repository file as repository url ::
    Repositories can be accessed with its own url that might start with
    // file:~/~// // or // http:~// //. Make sure that the repository is
    integrated with the project and specify url of the file to be reviewed as
    repository url. For eg, if a repository is rooted at
    [<PRE file:///home/repository/zeta >] and the file's relative path in the
    repository is [<PRE zeta/comp/core.py >], then specify the resource-url
    as,
    [<PRE file:///home/repository/zeta/zeta/comp/core.py >]
    and the repository's revision number as the //version number//.
: Repository file as site's url ::
    You might have noticed that repository files can be browsed via zeta once
    it is integrated with the site. By doing so, every repository file will
    get its own site url. For eg, if the repository being integrated get an id
    of say ''10'' and the file's relative path in the repository is
    // zeta/comp/core.py //, then specify the resource-url as,
    [<PRE /p/zeta/s/10/zeta/comp/core.py >]
    and the repository's revision number as //version number//.

=== Review participants

Each review will be for a single source file, with following categories of
users.

: Author ::
    There can be only one author for each review. //Author// should be a
    project member and responsible for taking ''actions'' on review-comments.
    Authors can also add review-comments for their source files.
: Moderator ::
    User who is creating the review automatically becomes review //moderator//.
    Though, moderator can be changed post review creation. Moderator
    is responsible to make sure that review-comments are acted upon and
    ''approve'' them. A review can be closed only after all review-comments
    are approved by the //moderator//. Moderators can also add review
    comments.
: Participants ::
    Participant can be any registered user, who will be granted permission to
    post their review-comments. There can be any number of participants.

style. To navigate through the grid, click on a cell or use up,
