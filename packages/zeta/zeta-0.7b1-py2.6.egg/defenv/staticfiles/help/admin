== Administration

=== Site Admin

Site administrator (``{c} admin``) or any user having ''SITE_ADMIN'' permission
can access the '/site-admin'/ page. Following tabs can be found in the
site-admin page,
# Site-info
# Site-config
# Users
# Projects
# Permissions
# License

==== Site info

Site info tab contains the global configuration fields which are applicable
to all projects. These fields are read-only and can be modified
only in the .ini file. [[ /help/IniConfig | Learn more ]]

==== Site config

All fields listed in site-config tab are configurable and the purpose of each
configuration field is listed side-by-side.
[[ /help/IniConfig | To know more visit here ]]

==== User management

Add / remove site-level permissions to registered users. Site-level
permissions do not cover project permissions (use project's admin tab for
that). Site level resources include license, guest wiki pages, search page
etc. [[ /help/pms | Know more about permissions ]]

Disabled users cannot sign-in. Re-enabling them will restore their status.

==== Projects

Enabling or Disabling projects do not have any effect now. This feature is
left for future development.

==== Permissions

Since there are many permissions, and normally, users will fall into categories
of permission access, administrators can create permission group for each
category and assign them to their users.

==== License

Lists all license agreement hosted on the site.

=== Project Administrator

Whoever creates a project becomes the project's administrator. Subsequently,
any registered user can be re-assigned as the project's administrator by
//site-admin// or by the project's current administrator. Project-admin
has unrestricted access to all pages under their project.

'' Being a //project administrator// is to administer project meta details. For contributing to
a project join one (or more) of project's team.''

Brief overview of project meta details,

: Project ::
    summary, description, project's license, mailinglist, ircchannel.

: Component ::
    name, description and component owner


: Milestone ::
    name, description, due-date for milestone, status of milestone,
    closing-remark if status is ''cancelled'' or ''completed''

: Versions ::
    name, description

> '' Tickets can be associated to project components, milestones and versions. ''

: Teams ::
    Users can be added or removed from project teams. Team types can be created
    only by site administrator(s) and are common to all projects. Every user
    who participates in the project needs to be in a team, and those
    with multiple roles can be associated with more than one team.

: Permissions ::
    Project's permission management is done at a team level by adding or
    removing permissions to teams.
