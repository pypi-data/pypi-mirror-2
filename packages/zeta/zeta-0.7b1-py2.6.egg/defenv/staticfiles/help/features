== Wiki

Wiki is powered by [[ /help/zwiki/ | ZWiki ]] engine, which was designed and
developed primarily to cater to the needs of zeta. It is intuitive and amalgamates
several good features from other wiki engines. It is designed and implemented
using a lexer and parser, providing for powerful features like macros and
extensions. We expect that our design and implementation of wiki engine will
cater to the future needs as well.

== Version control system

SVN is integrated with zeta, via which the user can browse the source
tree, view files, revisions and changelogs.
