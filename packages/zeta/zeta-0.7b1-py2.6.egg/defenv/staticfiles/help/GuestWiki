h3. Guest Wiki

Guest wiki pages are common to all projects and are independent of them.
Create guest wiki pages by entering a URL that is [[ UrlMapping | not mapped ]]
to a valid application function. Editing guest wiki pages is similar to editing
project wiki pages, it supports zwiki markup, but aside from these
similarities they are plain simple html pages without meta data association
for them.

Some of the simplest and most common use cases of guest wiki, are,
  * About-us page
  * Help pages
  * Terms of service page
  * Even the site's homepage

It can be noticed that, [[ ../aboutus | aboutus ]] and [[ /help/ | help ]]
page-links are available under meta-navigation bar.
[[ ../tos | Terms of service ]] link will be shown in user-registration page.
Site's homepage is nothing but a mapping of [[ ../frontpage | frontpage ]]
which can be edited like any other guest-wiki page.

:Title Index ::
    To list all guest wiki pages, visit [[ /titleindex | titleindex ]]
:Directory listing ::
    Guest wiki urls will be treated as directory listing, when its ends with
    a ''slash (/)''. Like listing [[ /help/ | help pages ]].
:Manually refreshing homepage::
    Like normal wiki-pages guest wiki-pages are translated and cached for
    performance reason. Thus, it could get out-dated when using dynamic
    macros. To manually translate out-dated pages click on the
    {{ Image( '/zetaicons/arrow_refresh.png', 'Translate' ) }} icon.
