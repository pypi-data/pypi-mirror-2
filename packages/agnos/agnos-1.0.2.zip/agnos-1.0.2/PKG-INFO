Description: Agnos - The Agnostic RPC Framework
        ==================================
        
        *Agnos* is a **cross-language**, **cross-platform**, lightweight RPC framework
        with support for passing objects *by-value* or *by-reference*. Agnos is meant
        to allow programs written in different languages to easily interoperate,
        by providing the needed bindings (glue-code) and hiding all the details from
        the programmer. The project essentially servers the same purpose as existing
        technologies like ``SOAP``, ``WSDL``, ``CORBA``, and others, but takes a
        **minimalist approach** to the issue at hand.
