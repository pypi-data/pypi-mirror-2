Description: ======================================
        Keyboard Training Software (for linux)
        ======================================
        
        A keyboard training program which I'm designing for my 8 year old son.
        
        This is a keyboard training program (i.e. typing tutor) for touch typing, still in it's early days.
        
        Goals:
        
        Open source and open community.
        Various languages supported (although not right to left nor logographic writing systems = ex. Kanji) (todo)
        Various international keyboards supported and probably dvorak keyboards as well. (todo)
        Attractive interface. (todo)
        Scalable graphics, make the window as small or as large as you like.
        Show the beginner typist where they should place their fingers. (todo)
        Interesting text for advanced users instead of just random gibberish. Will pull in text from Wikipedia entries, for
        various languages. (todo)
        Beginner levels will have random text, however, and they should focus on common bi=grams and trigrams of the language in
        question, to build up muscle memory for common key combinations. (todo)
        Random text should also start with very simple letter combinations, like two keys close together for training the first
        time. (todo)
        Stats and progression. (todo)
        Heatmap of trouble keys for the student. (todo)
        Auto build lessons to work on the trouble keys. (todo)
        Lessons for the number keys and punctuation marks. (todo)
        Start off without the space bar or the backspace key, add these keys later.
