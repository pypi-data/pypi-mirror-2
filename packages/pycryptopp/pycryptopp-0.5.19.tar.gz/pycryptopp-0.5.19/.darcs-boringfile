# Boring file regexps:

# _version.py is generated at build time, and never checked in
^pycryptopp/_version\.py$

# if ez_setup.py needs to build setuptools, that goes here
^setuptools-.*.egg$
# creating a tahoe egg puts files here
^pycryptopp.egg-info$

# if setup.py needs to install plugins from eggs to satisfy setup_requires:
^setuptools_darcs.*.egg$
^darcsver.*.egg$
^pyutil.*.egg$

^build($|/)
