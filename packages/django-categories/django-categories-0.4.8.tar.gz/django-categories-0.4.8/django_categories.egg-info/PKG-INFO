Description: This app attempts to provide a generic category system that multiple apps could use. It uses MPTT for the tree storage and provides a custom admin for better visualization (copied and modified from feinCMS).
        
        Goals of the project
        
        * Have a generic method for handling hierarchical data
        
        * Allow multiple independent trees, or just one tree
        
        * Have a widget for use in forms
        
        * In templates:
        
        + Show one level of a tree
        - All root categories
        - Just children of a specified category
        
        + Show multiple levels
        - Ancestors of category, category and all children of category
        - Category and its children
        
        + An inclusion tag for common methods of formatting categories
        - Grandparent :: Parent :: Child <-- current node
        - Add relative links for ancestors
        - Unordered list:
        * Grandparent
        * Parent <-- current node
        * Child 1
        * Child 2
        * Child n
