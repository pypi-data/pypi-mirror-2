Description: Pylons based web application framework on which the director admin is based.
        
        The evasion.web framework is 99% Pylons. I don't like calling it a framework,
        but I cannot think of a better description. It differs from Pylons in
        that is allows the loading of python packages with multiple controllers,
        templates, static files. Each python package can be the complete customer
        specific web application or it could be part of the overall application.
        
        This easily allows the componentisation or easy mashup of differing
        applications.
