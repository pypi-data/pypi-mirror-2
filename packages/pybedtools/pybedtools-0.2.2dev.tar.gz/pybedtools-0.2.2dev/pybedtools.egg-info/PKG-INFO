Description: 
        ``pybedtools`` is a wrapper around Aaron Quinlan's BEDtools suite
        (http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/), used for comparing genomic features.
        
        ``pybedtools`` allows you to intuitively call BEDtools programs from within
        Python without writing awkward system calls.
