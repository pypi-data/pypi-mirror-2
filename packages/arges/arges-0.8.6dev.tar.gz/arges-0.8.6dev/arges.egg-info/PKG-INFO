        ===========
        
        Simple and multi platform automated testing and tasks execution tool, that can be used straight from the command line.
        
        Arges scripts are very simple and emulate a very high level language from where you call the testing/execution actions.
        
        It supports handling parameters, which are totally separated from the scripts.
        
        Within the test scripts you call the actions which by now, are divides into three main categories:
        
        -Web handling. From where you can interact with any web site. Selenium 1.0.1 library is used internally.
        
        -Command line executions. To execute any kind of command and check the return code or its output.
        
        -Parameters handling. To store, retrieve or manage parameters.
        
        These actions are easily extensible, and due to the dynamic architecture of the system, it can takes you only 10 second to add a new one.
