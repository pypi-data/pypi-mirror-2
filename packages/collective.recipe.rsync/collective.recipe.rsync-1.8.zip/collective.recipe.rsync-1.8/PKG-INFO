        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.recipe.rsync`` is a ``zc.buildout`` recipe that copies a
        file (or files) between two locations via the ``rsync`` program. 
        
        It was originally created to make it easy to copy a ``Data.fs`` file
        between two Plone application environments e.g. from production to
        development, but you can use it to copy anything; e.g. ZODB blob files,
        and so on.
        
        .. Note::
        
            ``collective.recipe.rsync`` currently assumes you have a UNIX-based
            operating system and that the ``rsync`` binary is in your path when
            you execute buildout or the rsync script. Windows testers are welcome.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add a section to your ``buildout.cfg`` file, e.g. ``data``::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                ...
                data
        
            [data]
            recipe = collective.recipe.rsync
            source = myhost.com:/path/to/Data.fs
            target = var/filestorage/Data.fs
        
        This copies a Data.fs file from myhost.com to ./var/filestorage/Data.fs.
        
        Specify alternate SSH port
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Optionally, you may specify an alternate SSH port for ``rsync`` to use::
        
            [data]
            recipe = collective.recipe.rsync
            source = myhost.com:/path/to/Data.fs
            target = var/filestorage/Data.fs
            port = 22001
        
        This copies a Data.fs file from myhost.com to ./var/filestorage/Data.fs over
        port 22001.
        
        Create a script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Normally, ``collective.recipe.rsync`` will run ``rsync`` during the recipe
        installation. Optionally, you can create a script to execute ``rsync`` later
        by configuring the ``script = true`` option::
        
            [data]
            recipe = collective.recipe.rsync
            source = myhost.com:/path/to/Data.fs
            target = var/filestorage/Data.fs
            script = true
        
        This is useful in cases where you want to automate an ``rsync`` process with
        cron e.g. via http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.recipe.usercrontab.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Here is a real life example. This is one of the ways in which the author uses
        ``collective.recipe.rsync``::
        
            # Create scripts to deploy staging data to production.
            # Be VERY careful with this. You could easily overwrite your
            # live production data if you either forget to use the script
            # option, or accidentally run the bin/rsync-filestorage-to-production
            # script without stopping the production site first.
            [filestorage-to-production]
            recipe = collective.recipe.rsync
            source = var/filestorage/Data.fs
            target = ../aclark_net_website/var/filestorage/Data.fs
            script = true
        
            [blobstorage-to-production]
            recipe = collective.recipe.rsync
            source = var/blobstorage/
            target = ../aclark_net_website/var/blobstorage/
            script = true
        
        As the warning suggests, you should be careful with this. The author uses this
        particular configuration to deploy a staging site to production.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Switched to using subprocess to call rsync (to show progress to stdout) [mattss]
        * Replace print statements with logger [aclark]
        * Update docs
        
        1.7 (2011-01-21)

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Add ``script`` option 
        
          - Generates bin/rsync script
          - Disables rsync during buildout execution
          - Facilitates creation of scheduled rsyncs via cron

          facilitates copying over non-standard ssh ports.
