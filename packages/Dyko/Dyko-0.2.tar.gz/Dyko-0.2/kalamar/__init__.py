Kalamar - Content Management Library
====================================

Kalamar offers tools to access, create and edit data stored in heterogeneous
storage engines, with a simple key/value interface.

The storage engines are called "access points". Some access points map common
low-level storages such as databases or filesystems. Other access points can
manage, atop low-level access points, high-level features such as cache, keys
aliases or data formats.

Different access points can be listed in a Kalamar "site", and relations can be
defined between these access points, just as in a relational database. This
mechanism automatically links the items stored in the linked access points,
enabling the user to easily use joins if needed.
