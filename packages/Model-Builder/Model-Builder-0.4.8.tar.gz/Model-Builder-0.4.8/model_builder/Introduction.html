<h1>Introduction
</h1>
Model Builder is a graphical ODE simulator. &nbsp;It allows the user to
define, simulate and analyze arbitrary systems of Ordinary Diferential
Equations.<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Purpose<br>

<br>

</span>ModelBuilder
was created to be a generic interface to people that need to simulated
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) models and analyze their output.<br>

<br>

For
that purpose I wrote a (hopefully) nice frontend to the LSODA ODE
solving library, so that the model equations can be written directly in
the main window and the parameters for the numerical integration can
also be set easily.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Features<br>

<br>

</span>
<ul>

  <li>Equation-based
model definition. No need to learn to program to define and run your
models. Just type-in you differential equations</li>

  <li>Graphic output of
simulation. You can save the graphics in the most common formats: png,
svg, pdf, etc.</li>

  <li>Spreadsheet view
of the results. From the spreadsheet you can make customized plots from
your variables. You can also export your data to a .csv text file</li>

  <li>Latex rendering
of your system of equations. Check you equation in clear mathematical notation.</li>

  <li>Intuitive
graphical interface.</li>

  <li>Free software.
Licensed under the GPL</li>

  <li>Portable. Run
wherever Python runs.</li>

  <li>Uncertainty
analysis module. Implements a straightforward interface for the Bayesian Melding method.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Sensitivity analysis. Find out how sensitive your model is to variations in parameter values.</li>

</ul>
