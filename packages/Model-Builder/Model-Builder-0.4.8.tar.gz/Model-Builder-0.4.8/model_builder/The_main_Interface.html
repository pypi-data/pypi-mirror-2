<h1>The main Interface</h1>

The main frame of ModelBuilder is very simple. It contain three menus,
a toolbar with 3 buttons, and several text editing boxes for the
specification on the model.<br>

<br>

<h2>The menus</h2>

The first menu is
the file menu. It contains the standard open, save, save as, close and
exit options. These are pretty much self-explanatory. <br>

<br>

The
second menu is the analysis menu. In this menu You will find to options: Uncertainty Analysis Phase plot.
The uncertainty analysis&nbsp;option opens the uncertainty
analysis windows, for sensitivity and Uncertainty analyses <br>

<br>

The third and last is the help menu and it jus contains the entries for this help and the about&nbsp; message.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><br>

<br>

</span>
<h2>The Toolbar</h2>

The toolbar contains three buttons. The first one is the run button, which starts the simulation.<br>

<br>

The
second button shows a typeset version of the differential equations in
the model (this feature requires the latest version of <a class="resource autolink" title="Matplotlib" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net" target="_top">matplotlib</a>). <br>

<br>

The
third button shows the results of a simulation on a spreadsheet. From
there you can select variables to plot separately and save the results
to a csv(comma separated values) file.<br>

<br>

<h2>The Main Frame</h2>

The
main frame is designed for the easy specification of a model
consisting&nbsp; of a&nbsp; system of differential equations. This interface will
be covered in a later section where the definition of models is
explained.
