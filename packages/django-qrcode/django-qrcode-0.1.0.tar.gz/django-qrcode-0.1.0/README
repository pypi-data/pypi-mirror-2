Django QR
=========

Information
===========

Django QR is a simple Django application that provides some templatetags
that allows to include automatically QR codes on the Django site.

Installation
============

Once is installed from PyPI, you just need to add it to your settings as
'qrcode':

::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (..., 'qrcode', ...)

Usage
=====

Its usage is very simple. You just need to use the templatetag as follows:

::

  {% load qr_tags %}

  ...

  {% qr_from_text "text" "size" %}
  or
  {% qr_from_mail "mail_address" "size" %}


Where:

 * Size is not mandatory, and defines the dimensions of the QR code as following: 's' (120x120 pixels), 'm' (230x230 pixels) and 'l' (350x350). Any other option will be ignored and will use 'm' as default.
 * qr_from_mail tag just add a simple "mailto:" at the beggining, because some qr scanners can detect that as an email address in order to send it an email.
