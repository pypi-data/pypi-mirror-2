        Information
        ===========
        
        Django QR is a simple Django application that provides some templatetags
        that allows to include automatically QR codes on the Django site.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Once is installed from PyPI, you just need to add it to your settings as
        'qrcode':
        
        ::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS = (..., 'qrcode', ...)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Its usage is very simple. You just need to use the templatetag as follows:
        
        ::
        
          {% load qr_tags %}
        
          ...
        
          {% qr_from_text "text" "size" %}
          or
          {% qr_from_mail "mail_address" "size" %}
        
        
        Where:
        
         * Size is not mandatory, and defines the dimensions of the QR code as following: 's' (120x120 pixels), 'm' (230x230 pixels) and 'l' (350x350). Any other option will be ignored and will use 'm' as default.
         * qr_from_mail tag just add a simple "mailto:" at the beggining, because some qr scanners can detect that as an email address in order to send it an email.
