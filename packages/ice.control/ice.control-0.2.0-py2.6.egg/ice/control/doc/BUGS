List of known bugs in current release (0.1.0)
=============================================

** JavaScript not handles click-event on details view until
   details menu clicked. So, when load details pseudo-window, first
   view (`Base Info`) should not contain any links or forms.
   Need fix JS.

** Need better Google Chrome web browser support. Right now UI
   is not ideal in this browser. Use only Mozilla Firefox.

** Auto scrolling for REPL not works.
