        ice.control - System Administration and Site Management for BlueBream
        *********************************************************************
        
        ice.control is package for:
        
        - BlueBream application developers: `developer kit` and `starter kit`.
        - System administrators: `site management`.
        - Site managers: if you have defined a views for these tasks.
        
        Package overview
        ----------------
        
        This package does provide:
        
        - treeview ZODB browser
        - views for simple manipulate objects (remove, rename)
        - introspector
        - ajax based python shell with REPL to interact the application in
        selected ZODB context
        - configurator plugin forms to manage ZODB, edit metadata, other
        ajax based views and ability to add new views
        - other controls like generations and ZODB pack
        - optional simple skin (as part of `starter kit`)
        - optional module with all needed zcml registrations
        
        Each facility is optional. Include needed components using zcml, or
        include root configuration file to use entire functionality of the
        package.
        
        IMPORTANT NOTE: use Mozilla Firefox.
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Add `ice.control` dependency into main package of your BlueBream
        application. If you like to install the package from Git repository,
        see HACKME, section ``Install from Git repository``.
        
        There are number of options to use ice.control. You have define this
        including certain modules in zcml. If you like to use entire
        functionality of the package, add these directives into your configure.zcml
        file, before of `include file="securitypolicy.zcml"`::
        
        `include package="ice.control.zcml"`
        `include package="ice.control"`
        `include package="ice.control.repl"`
        `browser:defaultSkin name="control"`
        
        Now run tests and run the server::
        
        $ bin/test
        $ bin/paster serve debug.ini
        
        Open http://localhost:8080 and log in admin account and learn UI.
        
        
        Ajax based REPL
        ---------------
        
        You might open, close, minimize number of 'Details' pseudo-windows
        in the same time, and each plseudo-window will contain its own REPL
        session. Session is defined for user and context. So, each context
        has its own session.
        
        Predefined variables and methods:
        
        - `context` variable is current context in ZODB tree
        - `getObject` method from zope.security.proxy
        - `transaction` module imported
        
        Key bindings:
        
        - `up` - up to history
        - `down` - down to history
        - `Tab` - tab indent
        - `Ctrl+E` - go to line end

        ice.control development
        ***********************
        
        Fork author's branch on GitHub repository. Install it (see below) but
        use your own repository's private URL.
        
        
        Install from Git repository
        ---------------------------
        
        Download sources from GitHub repository using `mr.developer` buildout
        extension. You have much more control on the source code using this way.
        
        It requires number of steps first time, but simple to maintain in
        futher. First, add follow lines into buildout.cfg, section [buildout]::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        
        extensions = mr.developer
        sources-dir = dev
        sources = sources
        
        then run buildout to create `develop` script::
        
        $ bin/buildout
        
        then add section [sources] into buildout.cfg::
        
        [sources]
        ice.control = git git://github.com/astoon/ice.control.git
        
        and run the script to download the branch::
        
        $ bin/develop checkout ice.*
        
        You'll see now the package branch in /dev directory. Allow to run tests
        from ice.control package. For this, edit buildout.cfg again::
        
        [test]
        ...
        eggs = sample
        ice.control
        
        and add dependency for your project in setup.py::
        
        install_requires=[...
        'ice.control'
        ],
        
        Finally, run buildout::
        
        $ bin/buildout

        BUGS
        ****
        
        Bug reports: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ice.control.
        
        Or fork Git repository, fix bug and: a) send patch to <astoon.net@gmail.com>,
        or b) pull into your public repository at GitHub and send "pull request".
        
        List of known bugs in current release (0.3.0):
        
        - JavaScript not handles click-event on details view until
        details menu clicked. So, when load details pseudo-window, first
        view (`Base Info`) should not contain any links or forms.
        Need fix JS.
        
        - Need better Google Chrome web browser support in CSS. Right now UI
        styles is not ideal in this browser. For example, in REPL - not
        mono font. Use only Mozilla Firefox.

        Changelog
        *********
        
        
        0.3.0 (2010-04-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Namespace `++control++` instead of `++etc++control`.
        
        - Transitive security for IControl (10x location proxy).
        
        - Transitive access to content context from IControl (method get_content()).
        
        - Use controls not only on root folder, but on any content,
        i.e. 'foo/bar/++control++/'
        
        - Allow nested (recursive) namespaces, i.e. '++control++/++control++/'
        and etc.
        
        - Auto scrolling in REPL.
        
        - Used accurate permissions in all views.
        
        - DEfine explicit layer in skin's views.
        
        - Added ZODB Pack control.
        
        - Added Ctrl+E keybinding in REPL ("go to line end")
        
        - Front page for any context now (skin).
        
        - More convenient authentication.
        
        Two special permissions in the package:
        
        - ice.control.View (display Tree)
        
        - ice.control.REPL (use REPL)
        
        In summary, it can now be used as pluggable CMS UI for users with
        different permissions and roles, not only zope.Manager, from any nested
        content object, not only root folder, and UI should correctly display menu
        items and views accordingly to context and permissions.
