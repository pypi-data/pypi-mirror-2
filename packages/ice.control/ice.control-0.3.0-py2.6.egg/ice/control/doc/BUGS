List of known bugs in current release (0.3.0):

- JavaScript not handles click-event on details view until
  details menu clicked. So, when load details pseudo-window, first
  view (`Base Info`) should not contain any links or forms.
  Need fix JS.

- Need better Google Chrome web browser support in CSS. Right now UI
  styles is not ideal in this browser. For example, in REPL - not
  mono font. Use only Mozilla Firefox.
