Description: Sumatra is a tool for managing and tracking projects based on numerical
        simulation, with the aim of supporting reproducible research. It can be thought
        of as an automated electronic lab notebook for simulation projects.
        
        It consists of:
        
        * a command-line interface, smt, for launching simulations with automatic
        recording of information about the simulation, annotating these records,
        linking to data files, etc.
        * a web interface with a built-in web-server, smtweb, for browsing and
        annotating simulation results.
        * a Python API, on which smt and smtweb are based, that can be used in your own
        scripts in place of using smt, or could be integrated into a GUI-based
        application.
        
        Sumatra is currently alpha code, and should be used with caution and frequent
        backups of your simulation records.
