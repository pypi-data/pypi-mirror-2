Getting started
===============

Let us assume that you already have a project based on numerical simulation,
which you wish to start managing using Sumatra, and that the code for this
project is under version control. Note that the following is equally valid if
your project is based on numerical analysis rather than, or as well as,
simulation: just mentally replace "simulation" with "analysis" in the following.

Change to the working directory for your project, and then create a new Sumatra
project in this directory using the ``smt init`` command::

    $ cd myproject
    $ smt init MyProject
    
where ``MyProject`` is the project name. This creates a sub-directory named ``.smt``
and, if it doesn't already exist, a sub-directory named ``Data``.

Sumatra tracks data files created by your simulation by searching for newly
created files within a given directory tree. By default, it assumes that your
simulation will create files in a sub-directory ``Data`` of your working directory.
You can change this by providing the ``--datapath`` option to ``smt init``, e.g.::

    $ smt init --datapath=/data/myproject MyProject
    
Now Sumatra will look for new files within ``/data/myproject``.


Now let's run a simulation. We will assume that your simulation code is written
in Python_, and that you run the simulation by executing a file called ``main.py``,
passing it the name of a parameter file on the command line, i.e., you would
normally run a simulation using::

    $ python main.py default.param
    
To run it using Sumatra, you would use::

    $ smt run --executable=python --main=main.py default.param

Now we can see a list of the simulations we have run::

    $ smt list
    20090930-174949
    
This shows the label for each simulation we have run. Since we did not specify
a label, one was automatically generated from the timestamp. To see more detail,
use the ``--long`` option::

    $ smt list --long
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Label        : 20090930-174949
    Reason       :
    Outcome      :
    Duration     : 0.0548920631409
    Script       : MercurialRepository at /path/to/myproject rf9ab74313efe
                   (main file is main.py)
    Executable   : Python (version: 2.6.2) at python
    Timestamp    : 2009-09-30 17:49:49.235772
    Tags         :

    
(most options also have a short form, ``-l`` in this case.)

It is a bit tedious to have to tell Sumatra which simulator and which file to
run every time. Presumably, the name of the main file changes infrequently and
the simulator almost never. Therefore, these can be set as defaults for a given
project::

    $ smt configure --executable=python --main=main.py
    
(you could also have given these options to ``smt init``. ``init`` is used to create
a project and ``configure`` to change its configuration later, but they mostly
accept the same arguments).

Now you can run a simulation with a much shorter command line::

    $ smt run default.param
    
To see the current configuration of your project, use the ``info`` command::

    $ smt info
    Sumatra project
    ------------------
    Name                : MyProject
    Default executable  : Python (version: 2.6.2) at python
    Default script      : MercurialRepository at /path/to/myproject rf9ab74313efe (main file is main.py)
    Default launch mode : serial
    Data store          : ./Data
    Record store        : Relational database record store using the Django ORM (database file=.smt/simulation_records)
    
Sumatra automatically records the identity and versions of the simulation files
and the simulator executable, stores links to any files created by the
simulation, records any error messages, the date and time at which the simulation
was run, and its duration. You may also add your own annotations, in several
different ways. On running the simulation, you can specify a unique label, and
the reason for which you are running the simulation::

    $ smt run --label=haggling --reason="determine whether the gourd is worth 3 or 4 shekels" romans.param
    
After the simulation is complete, you can add a description of the outcome::

    $ smt comment "apparently, it is worth NaN shekels."
    
This adds the comment to the most recent simulation. You may also describe the outcome
of an earlier simulation, by specifying its ID (made up from the label and the
timestamp)::

    $ smt comment 20090930-174949 "Eureka! Nobel prize here we come."
    
You can also tag a simulation record with one or more short keywords::

    $ smt tag foobar
    $ smt tag barfoo
    
and remove tags::

    $ smt tag --remove barfoo

The parameter file may be in any format - it is your script which is responsible
for reading it. However, if it is in one of the :doc:`formats that Sumatra understands <parameter_files>`
then it is possible to modify parameter values
on the command line. Suppose ``default.param`` contains a parameter ``tau_m = 20.0``, as
well as a number of other parameters, then::

    $ smt run --reason="test effect of a smaller time constant" default.param tau_m=10.0

will generate a new parameter file identical to ``default.param`` but with ``tau_m``
equal to 10.0, and then will pass this new parameter file to your script. This
can be very convenient when you wish to study the effects of changing one or two
parameters, without having to edit your parameter file each time.

One of the main aims of Sumatra is to ensure the reproducibility of simulation
results. The ``repeat`` command re-runs a previous simulation, and checks that the
output is identical to that of the original run::

    $ smt repeat haggling
    The simulation results match.
    
Although it is better not to delete simulation records (so as to preserve a full
record of the project, false starts and all), it is possible::

    $ smt delete 2009101003-174949
    
It is also possible to delete all simulations with a given tag::

    $ smt delete --tag foobar
    
Most of the commands described here have further options that we have not
described. A full description of the options for each command is given in the
[command reference]. The full list of commands is available by running ``smt`` by itself::

    $ smt
    Usage: smt <subcommand> [options] [args]
        
    Simulation management tool, version 0.2

    Available subcommands:  
      init
      configure
      info
      run
      list
      delete
      comment
      tag
      repeat

and help on a given command is available by running the command with the ``--help``
option, e.g.::

    $ smt comment --help
    Usage: smt comment [options] [LABEL] [COMMENT]

    This command is used to describe the outcome of the simulation/analysis. If
    LABEL is omitted, the comment will be added to the most recent experiment.
    If the '-f/--file' option is set, COMMENT should be the name of a file
    containing the comment, otherwise it should be a string of text.

    Options:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -r, --replace  if this flag is set, any existing comment will be
                     overwritten, otherwise, the new comment will be appended to
                     the end, starting on a new line
      -f, --file     interpret COMMENT as the path to a file containing the
                     comment

or ``smt help CMD``, where ``CMD`` is the name of the command.

This tutorial has covered using ``smt`` for serial simulations/analyses. A further tutorial
covers :doc:`using smt for parallel computations <parallel_computations>`, whether batch or distributed
(using MPI_).

Also see :doc:`smtweb <web_interface>`, which provides a more graphical interface to viewing lists
of records than ``smt list``.
