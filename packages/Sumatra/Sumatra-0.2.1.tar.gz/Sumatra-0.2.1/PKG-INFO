Description: Sumatra is a tool for managing and tracking projects based on numerical
        simulation and/or analysis, with the aim of supporting reproducible research. It can be thought
        of as an automated electronic lab notebook for computational projects.
        
        It consists of:
        
        * a command-line interface, smt, for launching simulations/analyses with
        automatic recording of information about the experiment, annotating these
        records, linking to data files, etc.
        * a web interface with a built-in web-server, smtweb, for browsing and
        annotating simulation/analysis results.
        * a Python API, on which smt and smtweb are based, that can be used in your own
        scripts in place of using smt, or could be integrated into a GUI-based
        application.
        
        Sumatra is currently alpha code, and should be used with caution and frequent
        backups of your records.
