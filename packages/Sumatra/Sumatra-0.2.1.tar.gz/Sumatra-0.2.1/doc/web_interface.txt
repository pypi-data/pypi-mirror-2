=======================
Using the web interface
=======================

The web interface is built using the Django_  web
framework, and requires that Django be installed (see :doc:`installation`).

Before using the web interface, you must have created a Sumatra project using
``smt init``.

To launch the web interface, in your project directory run::

    $ smtweb &
    
This will launch a simple web server that listens on port 8000. Now open your
browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/

(If ``localhost`` doesn't work, try ``127.0.0.1``)

If port 8000 is already in use, you can specify a different port as an argument
to ``smtweb``.

Don't forget to kill the webserver process (e.g. with ``fg``, ``Ctrl-C``) when you are
finished with it.
