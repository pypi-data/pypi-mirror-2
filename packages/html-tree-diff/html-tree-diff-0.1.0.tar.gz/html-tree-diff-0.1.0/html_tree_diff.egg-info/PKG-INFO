        HTML Tree Diff
        ==============
        
        Structure aware diff of XML and HTML documents.
        
        The intended use is to concisely show the edits that have been made in a
        document, so that authors of html content can review their work.
        
        What do we mean by "HTML Tree Diff"?
        ------------------------------------
        
        * HTML:
          The inputs to the diff function are HTML documents
        * Tree:
          It considers the full XML tree structure of the inputs, not just text based changes.
        * Diff:
          The output is human-readable HTML, using <ins> and <del> tags to show the changes.
