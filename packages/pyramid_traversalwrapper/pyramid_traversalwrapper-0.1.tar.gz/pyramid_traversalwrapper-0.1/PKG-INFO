Description: pyramid_traversalwrapper
        ========================
        
        An alternate implementation of the
        ``pyramid.interfaces.ITraverserFactory`` (a "traverser") which
        wraps each traversed object in a proxy.  This allows a
        "location-ignorant" model (a model which does not possess intrinsic
        ``__name__`` and ``__parent__`` attributes) to be used as the root
        object and as any object returned from any other model's
        ``__getitem__`` method during traversal.
        
        See docs/index.rst for more information.
