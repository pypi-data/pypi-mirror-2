Installation
============

Use zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage packages:


* Add ``Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    eggs =
        Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    zcml =
        Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.


Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.

For that, move (or symlink) the ``PFGExtendedMailAdapter`` folder of this project
(``Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter/Products/PFGExtendedMailAdapter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

You can also skip the ZCML slug if you install this package the **Zope 2
Product** way.
