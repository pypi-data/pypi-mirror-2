        Installation
        ============
        
        Use zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage packages:
        
        
        * Add ``Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            eggs =
                Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            zcml =
                Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        
        Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
        package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.
        
        For that, move (or symlink) the ``PFGExtendedMailAdapter`` folder of this project
        (``Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter/Products/PFGExtendedMailAdapter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
        the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.
        
        You can also skip the ZCML slug if you install this package the **Zope 2
        Product** way.
