.. _tool-comparation:

This is not the first time I write a tool for
behaviour-driven development. I worked on Pyccuracy_ which is a
awesome tool for testing websites.

And as expected I am a hard user of Pyccuracy_, but since I met
Cucumber_, I fell in love for Scenario Outlines, global variables and
tables.  Althrough, Pyccuracy_ does not aim to do the same that
Cucumber_ does, sometimes it sucks, because Cucumber has very handy
features, that avoid code duplicity and so on.

Thus, Lettuce does not aim on website automated testing, Lettuce is a
multi-purpose testing tool.
