Description: This is a django application that provides a hierarchical navigation system.
        It takes over the URL naming for the resources that it is charge of, but should
        otherwise play nicely with existing projects. It defaults to using
        django.contrib.flatpages for the content, but can be linked to any other content.
        It can provide tight integration with javascript (jquery), and css for the dropdown
        menu, and allows you to set colours/pictures based on nav_item through the django
        admin interface.
        
        It currently requires the latest development version of Django (from subversion) and
        PIL (Python Image Library). It should work with Django 1.2 when that is released.
