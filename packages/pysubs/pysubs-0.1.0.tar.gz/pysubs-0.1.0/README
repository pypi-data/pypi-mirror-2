**PySubs** is a subtitle framework for Python 3. It features **native SubStation Alpha**
(ASS, SSA files) support and **a CLI tool** for batch subtitle manipulation like retiming or conversion.

(Èást dokumentace je k dispozici v èeštinì. / Parts of the documentation are also available in Czech.)

## Installation

Python 3.x is required -- PySubs *will not* run on Python 2.x. If you don't have
Python 3.x on your system, install it before installing PySubs. Windows and Mac
installers are available from <http://python.org/download/>; on Linux, please see
your distribution's repositories.

PySubs is available on PyPI: <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysubs/>. On Windows,
you may use the MSI installer. On other platforms, install from source -- download
the archive, extract it, go to the `pysubs-X.X.X` directory and execute

    setup.py install

from your terminal. To run the test suite (optional), execute

    python -m unittest discover -s testsuite

## Under the hood

### PySubs framework

    >>> import pysubs
    >>> subs = pysubs.load("subtitles.ass", encoding="utf-8")
    >>> subs.styles["Default"].fontname = "Calibri"
    >>> for line in subs:
    ...     line.text = "{\be1}" + line.text
    >>> subs.save("subtitles_fancy.ass")

### CLI tool

    pysubs.py --output-dir retimed --shift 1.3s *.srt
