Description: ==============
        UnicodeLexicon
        ==============
        ---------------------------------------
        A Unicode aware lexicon for ZCTextIndex
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        The standard ZCTextIndex lexicon only deals with 8-bit strings (and only
        if you get the zope.conf *locale* setting right).
        It does not handle Unicode or UTF-8. UnicodeLexicon fills this gap.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        This product adds a ZCTextIndex Unicode Lexicon type to Zope. The
        lexicon comes with word splitters, stop word removers, a case normalizer,
        and two accent normalizers.
        
        If you have GenericSetup installed, you can use the included extension
        profile to create a UnicodeLexicon in your portal_catalog and update
        the *Title*, *Description*, and *SearchableText* ZCTextIndexes.
        
        There is no upgrade path from UnicodeLexicon 1.0. If you have 1.0 on your
        system, you have to delete and recreate the lexicon.
        
        Pipeline Elements
        =================
        
        The splitter works with all languages that separate words with
        whitespace characters.
        
        The stop word remover knows about English language stop words only.
        
        The accent normalizer comes in two flavors. There is a normalizer for Latin
        and Western European text (fr, es, pt, it, en, nl), and one for German and
        Scandinavian text (de, dk, no, se, fi, is). The latter keeps the umlaut
        characters ä, ö, and ü in tact.
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        The lexicon assumes either Unicode or UTF-8. If your application uses
        a different encoding, you must change the ``enc`` constant in
        UnicodeSplitter.py accordingly.

        =======
        
        For CJK text you will want to use the standard ZCTextIndex lexicon in
        conjunction with CJKSplitter_. For Greek text you will want the standard
        ZCTextIndex lexicon with GRSplitter_.
