Description: 
        This is a library and a GUI control program written in Python for
        controlling a Waters 2700 Sample Manager (and compatible) liquid
        handling robot. These are quite common in Mass spectrometry labs and
        typically have 1-2 arms with attached syringes and one 6-port valve.
        
        The library allows to easily 
        
          *  control the movements of up to 2 arms
          *  control the syringe pump and 6-port valve to dispense and draw
             liquids from a reservoir or e.g. a 96-well plate
          *  save and recall positions (like "wash", "A1" on a plate, etc.) for
             easier scripting
        
        The GUI program provides a platform-independent graphical interface
        for the library. However, the library can be used without the GUI
        part.
