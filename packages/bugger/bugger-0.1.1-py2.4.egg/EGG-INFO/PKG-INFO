Description: Bugger Debugging Tools
        =======================
        
        Quick Overview
        --------------
        
        Bugger is a collection of debugging tools for python applications.  All the
        tools in the project have a couple common ideas/features that help to make
        the library cohesive and easily usable in your application.
        
        * Bugger tools help you debug your application by integrating in with
        your existing application, avoiding interference at all costs.
        
        * The Bugger tools have minimal dependencies.  If you have python 2.4+
        and the standard library, you should be able to use the tools.
        
        * The Bugger tools are well designed.  Sane defaults are provided to get
        you up-and-running quickly, but it is understood that you may need to
        customize things to fit your needs, we try to make this easy.
        
        * The Bugger tools are well documented.  Sphinx documentation for the
        project is regularly updated and available at
        http://packages.python.org/bugger/
