Description: This is an OpenID challenger for TiddlyWeb that replaces
        the one included in the core TiddlyWeb package. It improves
        on that one by using the python-openid package, thus supporting
        OpenID 2 and improved discovery mechanisms.
        
        To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.openid2' to auth_systems via
        tiddlywebconfig.py. The following example replaces all existing
        auth_systems with just openid.
        
        config = {
        'auth_systems': ['tiddlywebplugins.openid2'],
        }
        
        This package is licensed under the same terms at TiddlyWeb itself.
