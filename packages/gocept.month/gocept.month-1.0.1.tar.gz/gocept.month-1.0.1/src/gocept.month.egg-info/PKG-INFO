Description: ============
        gocept.month
        ============
        
        A datatype which stores a year and a month.
        
        This package provides the data type ``Month`` (typical usage:
        ``Month(4, 2003)``), which supports conversion to and from strings, as well as
        a zope.schema field and widgets for both zope.formlib and z3c.form.
        
        To use the month field, ``<include package="gocept.month"/>`` and declare a
        schema like this:
        
            >>> import gocept.month
            >>> import zope.interface
            >>> import zope.schema
            >>> class IContract(zope.interface.Interface):
            ...     title = zope.schema.TextLine(title=u"Contract title")
            ...     start = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Starting date")
            ...     end = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Ending date")
