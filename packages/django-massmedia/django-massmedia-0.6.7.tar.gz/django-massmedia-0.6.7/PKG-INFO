Description: Django-MassMedia
        
        Requires:
        django-tagging
        
        Optional, but used for extracting Metadata:
        IPTCInfo
        hachoir-core
        hachoir-metadata
        hachoir-parser
        
        
        To start using the app, place it in your INSTALLED_APPS. You may want to edit the settings.py file in the massmedia directory and adjust a few things. If you want to gather metadata, you should install the hachoir lib available at http://hachoir.org/. All in all, you will need the hachoir core,parser, and metadata packages installed.
        
        To customize the app, try editing some of the templates. Media items are templated with the show_media tag using templates based on the media's mimetype.
