(a copy of the original announcement)

I wrote dh_splitpackage, a helper script that unambiguously splits the files of
a binary package into multiple packages based on a configuration file.

The configuration file may point the primary package (the one that gets
leftover files by default) as well as any number of additional packages with
any number of inclusion and exclusion patterns.

The new script can be called instead of dh_install (assuming all the files you
are interested in are already in debian/tmp/) or afterwards.

The biggest advantage compared to existing tools is clear and
not-that-error-prone classification of files to packages. Any file that would
be classified to more than one package (hitting patterns in both files) is
clearly reported and prevents the package from building properly.  In addition
running the script displays each file from debian/tmp and the package it was
classified to.

Using this script could greatly simplify many packages that currently rely on
numerous *.install files and custom dh_install overrides in debian/rules.
