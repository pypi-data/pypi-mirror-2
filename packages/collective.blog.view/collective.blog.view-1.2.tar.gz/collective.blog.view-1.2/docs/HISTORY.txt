1.1 (2010-06-05)

  [regebro]

- It now shows the amount of comments each entry has, if it has comments
  enabled. [regebro]
  
- The view now accepts year and month parameters (in the url or form) and
  then restricts the entries to these dates. This means the view now also
  can work as an archive view. [regebro]
  
- Added credits to Bergen Offentlige Bibliotek. [regebro]

- Plone 4 support. [regebro]
  
- Make use of the typesUseViewActionInListings site property. [regebro]
