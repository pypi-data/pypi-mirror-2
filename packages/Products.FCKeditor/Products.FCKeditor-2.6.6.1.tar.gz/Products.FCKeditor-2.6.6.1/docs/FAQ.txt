FCKEditor Plone Help :
======================

---------------------------------
I. FCKeditor.Plone upgrade
---------------------------------  

   - Uninstall FCK editor from your Plone site (Quick Installer or Plone Control Panel)
   - Delete FCKeditor directory from your_instance/Products directory if exists (for versions < 2.6)
   - Read INSTALL.txt for buildout installation or how to use easy_install
   - Restart Zope
   - Install FCKeditor.Plone in your Plone Site via QuickInstaller or Plone Control Panel
   - Configure FCKeditor through the Plone control panel.   
  

FCK_PROPERTIES :
================
  
  When upgrading from FCKeditor.Plone >= 2.2.x fckeditor plone properties are 
  preserved after install/uninstall but if you want, you can clean it (recommanded) :
  ZMI > your site > portal_properties - delete fckeditor_properties

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.3.2 spellCheck properties have changed, if you have customized your toolbar, 
  change "SpellCheck" in "rtSpellCheck" for ff2+ and MSIE6+ client spellchecker. If you were using 
  aspell server spellchecker, it's not required.

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.3.3 "FitWindow" button has been added to switch editor field in fullscreen
  mode, if you have customized your toolbar, add 'FitWindow' in your customized toolbar.

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.4.1 "UniversalKey" function has been removed, 
  if you have customized your toolbar, remove 'UniversalKey' from your customized toolbar.

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.4.3 "UniversalKey" function has been re-added as optional plugin, 
  you can add 'UniversalKey' in your customized toolbar.

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.4.3 new important properties have been added, so deleting fckeditor_properties
  is highly recommanded (just rename it and you would be able to copy/paste by hand some of your customized properties)

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.6 one property have been removed : "gecko_uses_span" (no more useful because IE doesn't use Font tag anymore) 

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.6.5 imagemap plugin has been added in default custom toolbar, add the 'imgmapPopup' button to your own custom toolbar.

  Since FCKEditor.Plone 2.6.5.1 two new important properties have been added, fck_force_other_path_method and fck_force_other_root_method 
  deleting fckeditor_properties before reinstalling product is recommanded, otherwise you could get many errors.

CACHE :
=======
  
  Use CacheFu to get better performances, or at least, just change standard Plone HTTPCache params (unselect anonymous only is really important !!!).

  
  
Upgrade from old FCK.Plone versions (<=2.2) :
=============================================
  
  - Delete all previous specific FCKeditor ZMI customizations, 
  
  - You could need to upgrade your members wysiwyg_editor property
    in your portal_membership (this property has changed since FCKeditor.Plone 2.0.1 for easy cohabitation with Kupu and Epoz), 
    follow these steps :
    
    * In your Plone site ZMI > create an External Method
      Id            : updateFckUsers
      Title         : updateFckUsers
      Module Name   : FCKeditor.updateFckUsers
      Function Name : updateFckUsers
  
    * Click on test
    
    * Your portal_membership is updated
