Glad you could stop in.

Open Allure talking ;; Great.
Open Allure watching ;2 OK.
Open Allure listening ;[listen] Good. This one is a bit trickier.

[talking]
Open Allure uses the text-to-speech engine
available on each platform:

Windows ; Windows has a Speech API.  We access it for both text-to-speech and voice recognition.
Mac ; Mac has a program which generates very human-like speech. You can hear a sample on YouTube.

[watching]
Open Allure watches using the webcam.
Currently, this only works on Windows and Linux.

How does it work? ;;
> Continue ;2

The webcam takes a series of images and remembers them as the background.
It then subtracts that background from the next image it sees.
This difference reveals movement relative to the background.

[listen]
Currently, voice recognition only works under Windows.
The computer needs to be trained to recognize each speaker's accent.
Then it can translate spoken words into commands for the computer.
