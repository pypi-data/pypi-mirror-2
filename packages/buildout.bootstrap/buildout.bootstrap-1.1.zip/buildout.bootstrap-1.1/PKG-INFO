Description: 
        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``buildout.bootstrap`` (formerly collective.recipe.bootstrap) is a zc.buildout extension
        that adds a (zc.buildout) ``bootstrap.py`` file to your buildout.
        
        It satisfies the use case of::
        
        "I want to keep my buildout's bootstrap.py file up to date without having to manually download it from svn.zope.org."
        
        It also makes it possible (and easy) to add a bootstrap.py file to a buildout created
        via the command: ``buildout init``.
        
        If at this point you still don't understand, consider the following. With this extension
        you can avoid having to type::
        
        $ wget http://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        You mostly use this when you have initialized a new buildout (e.g. with
        ``buildout init``) and you want to:
        
        - Check in the buildout to a version control system
        - Check out the buildout elsewhere and bootstrap it
        
        See ``docs/INSTALL.txt`` for installation instructions.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To use extension, just add ``buildout.bootstrap`` to the [buildout] section of
        your ``buildout.cfg``::
        
        [buildout]
        extensions =
        ...
        buildout.bootstrap
        
        Now whenever you run Buildout this extension will add or update your
        buildout's bootstrap.py file, leaving you free to do other more important
        things: like write, test, and deploy your code!
