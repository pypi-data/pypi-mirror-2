        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is ``collective.rip`` AKA "Resources In Plone".
        
        For quick and dirty UI prototyping: install this add-on to edit CSS and 
        Javascript from within Plone (in the Plone control panel). You can also 
        toggle CSS/JS debug modes.
