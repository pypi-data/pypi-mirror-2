Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides form to update object properties via ``Plone`` UI.
        
        
        Quick Intro
        -----------
        
        * it replicates ZMI ``/manage_propertiesForm`` form in ``Plone`` UI
        * it's like ``collective.interfaces`` package to manage zope interfaces via
          ``Plone`` but to manage ``PropertyManager`` based properties
        * it uses ``z3c.form`` library to generate CRUD form
        * it is tested in ``Plone 3`` (``Plone 4`` to be checked soon)
        * it's installable via ``portal quickinstaller`` tool, for detailed instructions
          on how to add it to your zope instance, please, check ``docs/INSTALL.txt``
          file
        
        
        Property attributes
        -------------------
        
        ``IPropertyManager`` interface provides properties with the next list of
        metadata:
        
        * ``id``: required
        * ``type``: required
        * ``select_variable``: optional; for selection and multiple selection property
          types to provide the name of a property or method which returns a list of
          strings from which the selection(s) can be chosen
        * ``mode``: optional; must contain 0 or more chars from the set 'w', 'd'; 'w' -
          value may be changed by user, 'd' - user can delete property, '' - property
          and it's value may be shown in property listings, but it is read-only and
          may not be deleted; without mode key property is assumed to have the mode 'wd'
          (writeable and deletable)
        * ``label``: optional
        * ``description``: optional
        
        
        Property types
        --------------
        
        Default property manager property types are listed below. All of them are
        planned to be supported by ``collective.properties`` management form (see
        ``TODO`` section below for what's not implemented yet):
        
        * ``float`` - floating number
        * ``int`` - integer
        * ``long`` - long integer
        * ``string`` - utf-8 encoded string
        * ``lines`` - list of utf-8 encoded strings
        * ``text`` - utf-8 encoded text (string with line breaks)
        * ``date`` - Zope2 DateTime object
        * ``tokens`` - list of utf-8 encoded strings, entered as text line and split by
          space characters afterwards
        * ``selection`` - utf-8 encoded string, the only difference between string
          property type is that ``selection`` property values is selected from list of
          available options, this property type owns extra item in the property
          dictionary, 'select_variable' which provides the name of a property or method;
          note: make sure your vocabulary doesn't include unicode strings, only
          integers, floats, utf-8 encoded strings and booleans, otherwise old
          PropertyManager form breaks
          which returns a list of strings from which the selection can be chosen.
        * ``multiple selection`` - list of utf-8 encoded strings, these strings are also
          selected from list of available options as described above in ``selection``
          property type
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        It's been tested only with Plone 3 so far.
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        ``Property Manager`` interface defines some reserved strings that are prohibited
        to be used as property ids. It provides validation method which is also used by
        collective.properties management form. That's why it's secure to install this
        package in ``Plone`` site and let non-tech content manager use it's properties
        form.
        
        Not all standard properties are handled yet. For details, please, see ``TODO``
        section below.
        
        ``collective.properties`` form simply skips property types that it doesn't
        know how to handle. So to manage them you still need to use standard
        ``/manage_propertiesForm`` form.
        
        Form that this package provides to manage properties is fully compatible with
        old ``Property Manager`` form (``/manage_propertiesForm``) so it's possible to
        manage properties on both of them at the same time, and there won't be any
        issues with string encodings, etc... ``collective.properties`` form saves
        data in the same format original form does.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * add tests
        * test in plone4
        * improve installation docs re z3c.form versions and installing Plone z3cform
          support via quickinstaller
        
        Changelog

          [piv]
        
        - Disable deletion checkboxes for non-deletable properties. Validate deletion
          on server side as well.
          [piv]
        
        - Added selection and multiple selection property type handling.
          [piv]
