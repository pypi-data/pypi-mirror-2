Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides form to update object properties via ``Plone`` UI.
        
        
        Quick Intro
        -----------
        
        * it replicates ZMI ``/manage_propertiesForm`` form in ``Plone`` UI
        * it's like ``collective.interfaces`` package to manage zope interfaces via
          ``Plone`` but to manage ``PropertyManager`` based properties
        * it uses ``z3c.form`` library to generate CRUD form
        * it is tested in ``Plone 3`` (``Plone 4`` to be checked soon)
        * it's installable via ``portal quickinstaller`` tool, for detailed instructions
          on how to add it to your zope instance, please, check ``docs/INSTALL.txt``
          file
        
        
        Property attributes
        -------------------
        
        ``IPropertyManager`` interface provides properties with the next list of
        metadata:
        
        * ``id``: required
        * ``type``: required
        * ``select_variable``: optional; for selection and multiple selection property
          types to provide the name of a property or method which returns a list of
          strings from which the selection(s) can be chosen
        * ``mode``: optional; must contain 0 or more chars from the set 'w', 'd'; 'w' -
          value may be changed by user, 'd' - user can delete property, '' - property
          and it's value may be shown in property listings, but it is read-only and
          may not be deleted; without mode key property is assumed to have the mode 'wd'
          (writeable and deletable)
        * ``label``: optional
        * ``description``: optional
        
        
        Property types
        --------------
        
        Default property manager property types are listed below. All of them are
        planned to be supported by ``collective.properties`` management form (see
        ``TODO`` section below for what's not implemented yet):
        
        * ``float``
        * ``int``
        * ``long``
        * ``string``
        * ``lines``
        * ``text``
        * ``date``
        * ``tokens``
        * ``selection``
        * ``multiple selection``
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        ``Property Manager`` interface defines some reserved strings that are prohibited
        to be used as property ids. It provides validation method which is also used by
        collective.properties management form. That's why it's secure to install this
        package in ``Plone`` site and let non-tech content manager use it's properties
        form.
        
        Not all standard properties are handled yet. For details, please, see ``TODO``
        section below.
        
        ``collective.properties`` form simply skips property types that it doesn't
        know how to handle. So to manage them you still need to use standard
        ``/manage_propertiesForm`` form.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * handle selection and multiple selection property types
        * handle date property type
        * handle tokens property type
        * handle boolean field
        * make lines property type work
        * disable deletion checkbox for non-deletable properties
        * disable value field for non-editable properties
        * add tests
        * improve docs in README.txt as well as describe how form works in a form
          description, specifically on how selection property types work; improve
          installation docs re z3c.form versions and installing Plone z3cform support
          via quickinstaller
        * test on plone4
