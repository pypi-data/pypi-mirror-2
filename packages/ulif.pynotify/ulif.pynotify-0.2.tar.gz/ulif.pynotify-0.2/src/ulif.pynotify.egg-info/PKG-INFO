Description: ulif.pynotify -- Watch for filesystem changes
        *********************************************
        
        Scan filesystems and look for changes.
        
        Basically, a package that provides an API and scripts to scan parts of
        a filesystem for changes. The changes are returned as Python objects
        (API) or output on commandline.
        
        While `ulif.pynotify` itself is pure Python, some extensions (notably
        the SQLite support) require C extensions.
        
        .. warning:: This package is in a really early state!!!
        
        `ulif.pynotify` will make use of specialized filesystem watchdogs
        depending on the OS used, but right now it only contains a simple
        Python-only implementation.
        
        For this purpose the package provides a library and a script to detect
        filechanges. For 'remembering' file states `ulif.pynotify` provides
        SQLite support.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The full package documentation can be found at:
        
        http://packages.python.org/ulif.pynotify
        
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        `ulif.pynotify` is currently tested on Linux only.
        
        * you need Python >= 2.4
        
        * for full install (includung tests etc.) you also need the Python
        header files and a working C-compiler like `gcc`.
        
        Installing the Library
        ======================
        
        Use `easy_install` to install the library.
        
        Or download the sources and in the root dir of the extracted package
        do::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        You might need superuser permissions to do that.
        
        
        Installing for Development
        ==========================
        
        After downloading and extracting the sources, in the root dir of the
        downloaded file tree do::
        
        $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        which will configure the package for your system. Then, run::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        which will generate all scripts needed for development in the local
        ``bin/`` directory.
        
        Running Tests
        -------------
        
        Afterwards you can run the tests by doing::
        
        $ ./bin/test
        
        Creating Docs
        -------------
        
        `ulif.pynotify` comes with some documentation in the ``docs/``
        folder. It can be turned into `Sphinx` based HTML by running::
        
        $ ./bin/make-docs
        
        The docs then can be found in ``docs/_build/html``.
        
        Creating Coverage Reports
        -------------------------
        
        We try to keep `ulif.pynotify` at a 100%-test-covered level. You can
        do the coverage report by issuing on the command line::
        
        $ ./bin/coverage-detect
        $ ./bin/coveragereport
        
        This will create HTML docs of the test coverage of each module.
