Description: A-like integration of SQLAlchemy based on z3c.sqlalchemy
        ========================================================
        
        What is SQLAlchemyDA?
        ---------------------
        
        SQLAlchemyDA is a generic database adapter for ZSQL methods. Since it is based
        on SQLAlchemy, SQLAlchemyDA supports all databases out-of-the box that are
        supported by SQLAlchemy (Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, MS-SQL, Firebird,
        Informix).
        
        
        Requirements:
        -------------
        
        - Zope 2.10+
        - SQLAlchemy >= 0.5.0 (+ database specific low-level Python drivers)
        - z3c.sqlalchemy >= 1.2.0
        
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        - download and install SQLAlchemy as egg or from the sources
        from Cheeseshop (easy_install sqlalchemy). See
        
        http://www.sqlalchemy.org
        
        for details
        
        - download and install z3c.sqlalchemy as egg or from the sources
        from Cheeseshop (easy_install z3c.sqlalchemy). See
        
        http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/z3c.sqlalchemy/
        
        for details.
        
        - unpack the archive containing SQLAlchemyDA inside the "Products"
        directory of your Zope instance home.
        
        - after restarting Zope you go to the ZMI and create an instance of
        "SQLAlchemyDA" (as you would create some DA instance)
        
        - click on the new created SQLAlchemyDA instance within the ZMI
        and configure your database connection through the "Properties" tab.
        The connection parameter 'dsn' must be specified as a valid SQLAlchemy DSN
        like
        
        <dbschema>://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/<databasename>
        
        Example:
        
        postgres://admin:123@localhost:5432/TestDB
        
        - ZSQL methods should see the new DA through the selection widget of available
        database adapters
        
        - NOTE: you must have the low-level Python DB drivers installed in order to
        access a particular database. See
        
        http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/dbengine.html#dbengine_supported
        
        for details.
        
        
        Configuration of SQLAlchemyDA:
        ------------------------------
        
        - 'dsn' - SQLAlchemy compliant Database Set Name (see www.sqlalchemy.org/docs)
        
        - 'transactional' - uncheck this property if you are working with a non-transactional
        database like older versions of MySQL. Uncheck this property *only* if you see any
        commit() related error. Otherwise leave this property checked. Changing this
        property *requires* a Zope restart.
        
        - 'quoting_style' - affects how strings are quoted in SQL. By default 'standard'
        quotes strings correctly. Setting the value to 'no-quote' might solve quoting issues
        with some databases.
        
        
        Using SQLAlchemyDA:
        -------------------
        
        SQLAlchemyDA works as a database adapter as documented within "The Zope Book"
        
        http://www.plope.com/Books/2_7Edition/RelationalDatabases.stx
        
        and can be used like any other DA together with ZSQL methods.
        
        
        Tested with databases:
        ----------------------
        
        - Postgres 7.4, 8.0-8.2
        - SQLite 3.3.X
        - Oracle 10g
        - MySQL is *only* supported for MySQL databases with transaction support.
        (see also z3c/sqlalchemy/README.txt)
        
        
        Known issues:
        -------------
        
        """ Database connection could not be opened ((ProgrammingError) (1064, You
        have an error in your SQL syntax near 'COMMIT .
        """
        
        This bug might appear with older MySQL versions when opening/closing
        the connections manually through the ZMI. It should not affect the
        functionality of SQLAlchemyDA.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.5.0 (2010-05-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed LP #570208
        - Added a method 'add_extra_engine_options' to set additional engine
        options for SQLAlchemy.create_engine.
        - Removed SOFTWARE_HOME dependency
        - Requires SQLALchemy >= 0.5.0
        
        0.4.1 (2008-06-01)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed issue with version.txt file
        
        0.4.0 (2008-01-24)
        ------------------
        
        - requires z3c.sqlalchemy (2.0.0 or higher)
        - requires SQLAlchemy 0.4.4 or higer
        
        
        0.3.0 (2007-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed some security assertions
        - added "Test" tab for executing SQL queries directly
        - better error handling for ZMI screens
        - no longer depending on a pre-registered SQLAlchemy wrapper. SQLAlchemyDA
        now accepts (as any other DA) a DSN as property 'dsn'
        - DSN can be passed through the add form
        - redirect directly to "Info" tab after creating an instance through the ZMI
        - catching some low-level exceptions from the sqlite interface in order to
        make it work with SQLite
        - new properties 'transactional' and 'quoting_style'
        - improved support for Oracle and MySQL
        - SQLAlchemyDA no longer provides access to mapper related functionalities.
        It now acts as a DA for executing SQL statements *only*.
        - fixed unregistration code for a wrapper (hopefully works with Zope 2.8 or
        higher)
        
        - updated documentation

        ------------------
        
        - connections can be closed/opened through the ZMI
        - some code cleanup
        - fixed a *very* stupid typo causing ZODB conflict errors
        
        0.2.0 (2007-05-05)
        ------------------
        
        - first public release
        
        0.1.0 (2007-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - initial coding
