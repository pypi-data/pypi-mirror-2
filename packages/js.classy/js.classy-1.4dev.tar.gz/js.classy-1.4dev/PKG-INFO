        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Classy`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Classy`: http://classy.pocoo.org/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.classy``) are published to some URL.
