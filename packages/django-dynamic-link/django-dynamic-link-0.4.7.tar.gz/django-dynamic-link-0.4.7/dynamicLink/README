============

**Dependences**

    * This app
    * Django itself, its redirects from django.contrib and its locale middleware.

**Installation**

    *Manual Installation*

        * Download the file and unzip it.
        * Copy the folder in your project root.

    *Installation with pip*

        * Type in your terminal: "pip install django-dynamic-link"
        * With pip you can also uninstall it: "pip uninstall django-dynamic-link"

    *Other possibilities*

        * Open a terminal and change to the folder which contains the setup.py and then type "setup.py install"

**test your installation**

Go to console and type:

    * :~$ python
    * import dynamicLink
    * dynamicLink.VERSION
    * help(dynamicLink)

**Setup**

    * Add "dynamicLink" to you installed apps in the settings file.
    * Make sure that:
        -   'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware', is in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
        -   'django.contrib.redirects.middleware.RedirectFallbackMiddleware', is in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
        -   'django.contrib.redirects', is added to your INSTALLED_APPS.
        -   Your Admin is enabled ('django.contrib.admin', is in your INSTALLED_APPS.)
    * Add the following to your urls.py:
        -   from dynamicLink import dl_settings
        -   (r'^%s/' % dl_settings.DYNAMIC_LINK_URL_BASE_COMPONENT, include('dynamicLink.urls')),
    * Change the pattern for your admin in urls.py from (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)), to (r'^%sadmin/(.*)' admin.site.root),
    * Run "python manage.py syncdb".
    * And finally "python manage.py runserver".

**Make it custom**

    You have the following variables to overwrite the applications presettings.

    * DYNAMIC_LINK_MEDIA
        - Default: settings.MEDIA_ROOT
        - A path to a directory. From this point you can walk down the subdirectories to choose your files to serve.
    * DYNAMIC_LINK_URL_BASE_COMPONENT
        - Default: 'serve'
        - A string that modifies your url serve path.
        - Example: www.example.com/DYNAMIC_LINK_URL_BASE_COMPONENT/link/3839hd8HKl3/example.zip.

    Use the global settings.py in your projects root or create an extra file named dl_settings.py there (which is used then instead of settings.py. May customize and use the file from the example folder).

=====
Usage
=====

Open the admin interface and go to "Dynamiclink" section. The rest should be self-explanatory.

**Hints**

    * Zero value for link age means never expires.
    * Zero value for clicks means unlimited clicks.
    * If a link never expires you can use it for click counting.
    * Trough the action menu you can serve a site with several links. 
    * The filename from the created links are only for human readability. You can delete or change this filenames in any way you want.
