        -   from dynamicLink import dl_settings
        -   (r'^%s/' % dl_settings.DOWNLINK_SERVE_PATH, include('dynamicLink.urls')),

Usage
=====

    * For options review your dl_setting.py
    * Open the admin interface and go to "Dynamiclink" section. The rest should be self-explanatory.

**Hints**

    * Zero value for link age means never expires.
    * Zero value for clicks means unlimited clicks.
    * If a link never expires you can use it for click counting.
    * Trough the action menu you can serve a site with several links. 
    * The filename from the created links are only for human readability. You can delete or change this filenames in any way you want.
