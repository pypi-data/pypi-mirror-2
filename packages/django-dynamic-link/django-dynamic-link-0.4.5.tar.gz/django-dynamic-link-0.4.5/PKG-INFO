        **Setup**
        
            * Add the "dynamicLink" to you installed apps in the settings file.
            * Make sure that:
                -   'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware', is in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
                -   'django.contrib.redirects.middleware.RedirectFallbackMiddleware', is in your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
                -   'django.contrib.redirects', is added to your INSTALLED_APPS.
                -   Your Admin is enabled ('django.contrib.admin', is in your INSTALLED_APPS.)
            * Add the following to your urls.py:
                -   from dynamicLink import dl_settings
                -   (r'^%s/' % dl_settings.DOWNLINK_SERVE_PATH, include('dynamicLink.urls')),
            * Change the pattern for your admin in urls.py from (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)), to (r'^%sadmin/(.*)' admin.site.root),
            * Run "python manage.py syncdb".
            * And finally "python manage.py runserver".
        
        =====
        Usage
        =====
        
            * For options review your dl_setting.py
            * Open the admin interface and go to "Dynamiclink" section. The rest should be self-explanatory.
        
        **Hints**
        
            * Zero value for link age means never expires.
            * Zero value for clicks means unlimited clicks.
            * If a link never expires you can use it for click counting.
            * Trough the action menu you can serve a site with several links. 
            * The filename from the created links are only for human readability. You can delete or change this filenames in any way you want.
