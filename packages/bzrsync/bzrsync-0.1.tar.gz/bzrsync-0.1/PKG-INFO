Description: BzrSync - Bazaar repository/branch synchronization tool
        =======================================================
        
        BzrSync is a tool to help a developer using Bazaar on multiple machines.
        It automatically keeps selected repositories and branches synchronized across
        the machines. Bazaar itself is used for the synchronization (with "bzr pull"),
        ensuring consistency at all times.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - any number of machines are supported
        
        - consistency is guaranteed at all times
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the latest stable version of BzrSync, using pip_:
        
        ::
        
          pip install bzrsync
        
        or using setuptools_:
        
        ::
        
          easy_install bzrsync
        
        Otherwise, if neither pip_ nor setuptools_ are available, it is possible
        to download (eg. from PyPI_) the `source`_ package, extract it and run the
        usual ``setup.py`` commands:
        
        ::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        .. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
        .. _EasyInstall: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        .. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi
        .. _`source`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bzrsync
        
        
        Help and Development
        --------------------
        
        Alternatively, if you'd like to update the software occasionally to pick
        up the latest bug fixes and enhancements before they make it into an
        offical release, branch from the `Bazaar`_ repository hosted on `LaunchPad`_
        instead.
        Just follow the procedure outlined below:
        
        1. Make sure that you have `Bazaar`_ installed, and that you can run its
           commands from a shell. (Enter ``bzr help`` at a shell prompt to test
           this.)
        
        2. Create a local branch and working tree from the official one::
        
            bzr branch lp:bzrsync bzrsync
        
        3. Then from the ``bzrsync`` directory you can run the ``setup.py develop``
           command to install the library in your Python `site-packages` directory
           using a link, which allows to continue developing inside the working tree
           without the need to re-install after every change. See the
           `setuptools development mode`_ documention for more information::
        
            $ sudo
            # python setup.py develop
