        TiddlyWeb, aka mo'ass, is a RESTful data store which forms the core
        of a reference implementation of an ideal server side implementation
        for TiddlyWiki. It attempts to provide a tested, documented, and clear
        implementation of several facets that make up a good server side:
        
        * transparent system and code suitable for porting to other
        languages (where use specific optimizations will hopefully occur)
        * an abstract model for authentication and authorization
        * an implementation of authenticated recipes and bags allowing
        the conrolled access to dynamically created collections of tiddlers
        * clean HTTP API based on REST principles
        * test driven description and development
        
        The initial implementation is not designed to be highly performant
        nor especially scalable. The system is designed so that parts
        that are not optimal for a particular installation can be easily
        improved or swapped out.
        
        Throughout the process of development TiddlyWeb has evolved from
        being specifically a TiddlyWiki server-side to a generic data store
        that builds on concepts learned from TiddlyWiki, primarily the concept
        of the tiddler: a small chunk of data used to build up a greater whole.
        
        TiddlyWeb includes a command line tool called twanager. Run twanager
        without arguments for a list of available commands.
        
        REQUIREMENTS
        ============
        
        * Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6. (Python 3 has not yet been tested.)
        * selector: http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/
        * simplejson: http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson
        * html5lib (for sanitizing input which may be rendered as HTML):
        http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/
        
        If you wish to use TiddlyWeb as a server-side for TiddlyWiki to generate
        a multi-user TiddlyWiki system, you will also need:
        
        * tiddlywebwiki (a Python package containing the necessary
        TiddlyWeb and TiddlyWiki plugins):
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebwiki
        
        If you have downloaded a tarball of TiddlyWeb and you have Python's
        setuptools, running the following command will automatically install
        TiddlyWeb and its requirements to the usual locations (you most likely
        will need to be an administrative user for this to work):
        
        python setup.py install
        
        If you are using TiddlyWeb from source checked out from the
        http://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlyweb repository, you can install
        the necessary requirements by hand:
        
        Selector and simplejson can be installed with easy_install, which
        either comes with your python distribution and should be on your path,
        or is part of setuptools which you can install. See
        
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        and

        familiar with them.

        docs/TESTING:
        Information about the tests located in the test directory.
        index.cgi:
        A sample of how to make TiddlyWeb run as a CGI with a web server
        such as Apache.
        apache.py:
        A sample of how to make TiddlyWeb run under mod_wsgi or mod_python
        and Apache.
        
        See http://tiddlyweb.peermore.com/ for a TiddlyWiki generated by TiddlyWeb
        and TiddlyWebWiki, a TiddlyWeb plugin that provides TidldyWiki server-side
        functionality. That wiki contains the TiddlyWeb documentation.  You can also
        leave comments there to help improve the documentation.
        
        See http://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlyweb-plugins
        for some samples of plugins that TiddlyWeb can use with itself.
