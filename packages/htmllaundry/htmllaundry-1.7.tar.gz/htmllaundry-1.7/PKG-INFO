Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains several handy python methods to cleanup HTML markup
        or perform other common changes. The cleanup is strict enough to be able
        to clean HTML pasted from MS Word or Apple Pages. This package also contains
        integration code for `z3c.form`_ to provide fields that automatically
        sanitize HTML on save.
        
        The implementation is based on the ``Cleaner`` class from `lxml`_.
        
        
        Cleanup routines
        ================
        
        All cleanup routines can be invoked through the single ``sanitize`` function.
        This functions takes an input string as input and will return a cleaned up
        version of that string. Here is a simple example::
        
          >>> from htmllaundry import sanitize
          >>> sanitize('Hello, <em>world</em>')
          '<p>Hello, <em>world</em></p>'
        
        The sanitize method takes an extra optional parameter with a lxml Cleaner
        instance, which can be used to use different filtering rules. htmllaundry
        includes three cleaners:
        
        * ``htmllaundry.cleaners.DocumentCleaner``, which is the default cleaner. This
          cleaner will allow most safe tags, while stripping out inline styles and
          insecure markup.
        
        * ``htmllaundry.cleaners.LineCleaner`` is a more strict cleaner which only
          allows a few inline elements. This is useful in places where you only
          want to accept single-line input, for example in document titles.
        
        * ``htmllaundry.cleaners.CommentCleaner`` only allows a very limited set of
          HTML elements, and is designed to be useful for user provided comments. It
          will also force all external links to open in a new browser window.
        
        
        If you want to go all the way you can also use ``StripMarkup`` to strip
        all markup from your input::
        
          >>> from htmllaundry import StripMarkup
          >>> StripMarkup('Hello, <em>world</em>')
          'Hello, world'
        
        
        z3c.form integration
        ====================
        
        If you want to use the ``z3c.form`` integration you should use the ``z3cform``
        extra for this package::
        
          install_requires=[
               ....
               htmllaundry [z3cform]
               ...
               ],
        
        In addition you will need to load the ZCML. In your ``configure.zcml`` add
        a line like this::
        
          <include package="htmllaundry" />
         
        You can then use the `HtmlText` field type in your schemas. For example::
        
          from zope.interface import Interface
          from zope import schema
          from htmllaundry.z3cform import HtmlText
        
          class IDocument(Interface):
              title = schema.TextLine(
                      title = _(u"Title"),
                      required = True)
        
              description = HtmlText(
                      title = _(u"Description"),
                    required = True)
        
        Please note that using ``HtmlText`` will not automatically give you a WYSYWIG
        widget.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.7 - November 30, 2010
        -----------------------
        
        * Make forcing of target attributes on externals linke configurable via a
          new ``link_target`` option in the cleaners. Only enable this option for
          the ``CommentCleaner``.
        
        
        1.6 - November 18, 2010
        -----------------------
        
        * Correct whitespace test for wrapping bare text as well.
        
        
        1.5 - November 18, 2010
        -----------------------
        
        * Correct whitespace checks to handle all unicode whitespace. This fixes problems
          with \xA0 (or &nbsp; in HTML-speak) being treated as text.
        
        
        1.4 - August 3, 2010
        --------------------
        
        * Small code cleanup.
        
        * Strip leading breaks.
        
        
        1.3 - July 30, 2010
        -------------------
        
        * Strip all top level br elements. Breaks are fine in blocklevel elements,
          but should not be used to add vertical spacing between block elements.
        
        
        1.2 - February 15, 2010
        -----------------------

        * Strip trailing breaks.
        
        
        1.1 - February 5, 2010
        ----------------------
        
        * Add a simple StripMarkup method.
        
        * Add ZCML necessary for z3c.form integration.
        
        
        1.0 - February 5, 2010
        ----------------------
        
        * First release
