- setup of composable should happen in composite_tool rather than in
  kupu_library_tool

- viewlets should use macros (to structure a bit the HTML included), named
  "portlet" (to be able to reuse portlets as well)

- createCompoFragment and createCompoTitle cause problems when another
  user deleted the navigation page and the current user tried to add
  Title or HTML. When the user tries to add content, he gets a
  javascript error (unknown origin).

plone 2.1 compat
================

  * smart ids

  * replace layouts by templatemixin ?

Plone 2.5 compatibility
=======================

  * Viewlets can not be added using the ZMI (you get a login screen)

  * Added import_step for fixing up the azax layer in portal_skins
    (currently works only through QuickInstaller).
