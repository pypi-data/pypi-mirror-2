Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an extension to the test runner to the one that ships
        with ``zope.testing``, as well as a buildout recipe based on
        ``zc.recipe.testrunner`` to install a test script for this test runner.
        
        The test runner is identical to the one in ``zope.testing``, but it is capable
        of writing test reports in the XML format output by JUnit/Ant. This allows
        the test results to be analysed by tools such as the Hudson continuous
        integration server.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        In your buildout, add a part like this::
        
        [buildout]
        parts =
        ...
        test
        
        ...
        
        [test]
        recipe = collective.xmltestreport
        eggs =
        my.package
        defaults = ['--exit-with-status', '--auto-color', '--auto-progress']
        
        The recipe accepts the same options as zc.recipe.testrunner, so look at its
        documentation for details.
        
        When buildout is run, you should have a script in ``bin/test`` and a directory
        ``parts/test``.
        
        To run the tests, use the ``bin/test`` script. If you pass the ``--xml``
        option, test reports will be written to ``parts/test/reports`` directory::
        
        $ bin/test --xml -s my.package
        
        Use ``bin/test --help`` for a full list of options.
        
        If you are using Hudson, you can now configure the build to publish JUnit
        test reports for ``<buildoutdir>/parts/test/testreports/*.xml``.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b3 - 2010-06-07
        ------------------
        
        * Rename the ``-x`` option ``--xml``. This is necessary by zope.testing now
        uses the ``-x`` option for something else. :-(
        
        1.0b2 - 2009-11-08
        ------------------
        
        * Maintain compatibility with zope.testing 3.7.
