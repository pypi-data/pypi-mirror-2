Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an extension to the test runner to the one that ships
        with ``zope.testrunner``, as well as a buildout recipe based on
        ``zc.recipe.testrunner`` to install a test script for this test runner.
        
        The test runner is identical to the one in ``zope.testrunner``, but it is
        capable of writing test reports in the XML format output by JUnit/Ant. This
        allows the test results to be analysed by tools such as the Hudson continuous
        integration server.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        In your buildout, add a part like this::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                ...
                test
        
            ...
        
            [test]
            recipe = collective.xmltestreport
            eggs =
                my.package
            defaults = ['--auto-color', '--auto-progress']
        
        The recipe accepts the same options as zc.recipe.testrunner, so look at its
        documentation for details.
        
        When buildout is run, you should have a script in ``bin/test`` and a directory
        ``parts/test``.
        
        To run the tests, use the ``bin/test`` script. If you pass the ``--xml``
        option, test reports will be written to ``parts/test/testreports`` directory::
        
            $ bin/test --xml -s my.package
        
        Use ``bin/test --help`` for a full list of options.
        
        If you are using Hudson, you can now configure the build to publish JUnit
        test reports for ``<buildoutdir>/parts/test/testreports/*.xml``.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 (2011-01-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Added support for Manuel_ tests. It gets activated when the package under
          test has tests using `manuel` and this way depends on `manuel`.

        1.1 - 2011-01-20
        ----------------
        
        - Require `zope.testrunner` and remove support for zope.testing 3.7.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for `zope.testrunner` while retaining support for the older
          `zope.testing.testrunner`.
          [hannosch]
        
        - No longer use the deprecated `zope.testing.doctest`.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Distribution metadata cleanup.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use built-in `xml.etree` in favor of `elementree` in Python 2.5+ and added
          missing dependency on `zc.recipe.egg`.

        1.0b3 - 2010-06-07
        ------------------
        
        * Rename the ``-x`` option ``--xml``. This is necessary by zope.testing now
          uses the ``-x`` option for something else. :-(
        
        1.0b2 - 2009-11-08
        ------------------
        
        * Maintain compatibility with zope.testing 3.7.
        
        1.0b1 - 2009-11-07
        ------------------
        
        * Initial release
