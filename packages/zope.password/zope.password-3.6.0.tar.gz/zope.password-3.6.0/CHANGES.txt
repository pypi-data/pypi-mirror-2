3.6.0 (2010-05-07)
------------------

- Removed zope.testing dependency for tests.

- Updated some copyright headers to comply to repository policy.

- Added zpasswd script formerly hold in zope.app.server. Contrary to
  former zpasswd script, which used "Plain Text" as default password
  manager, now SSHA is used as default.


3.5.1 (2009-03-14)
------------------

- Make security protection directives in `configure.zcml` execute only
  if ``zope.security`` is installed. This will allow reuse of the
  `configure.zcml` file in environments without ``zope.security``,
  for example with ``repoze.zcml``.

- Add "Password Manager Names" vocabulary for use with ``zope.schema``
  and ``zope.component``, like it was in ``zope.app.authentication``.
  It's an optional feature so it doesn't add hard dependency. We use
  "vocabulary" extra to list dependencies needed for vocabulary functionality.

3.5.0 (2009-03-06)
------------------

First release. This package was splitted off from ``zope.app.authentication``
to separate password manager functionality that is greatly re-usable without
any bit of ``zope.app.authentication`` and to reduce its dependencies.
