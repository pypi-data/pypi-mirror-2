ISSUES
======

* If ``pyppd`` does not find PPDs, issue a warning during compression run and
  let ``pyppd-ppdfile list`` do not output anything on stdout and a warning on
  stderr.
* Add logging facilities
* Add unit tests
* When testing if the PPD generated from the *Product line already exists in a
  *1284DeviceID line, we do a case-sensitive test. I think it should be case-
  insensitive.
