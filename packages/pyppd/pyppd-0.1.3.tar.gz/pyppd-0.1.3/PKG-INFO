Description: pyppd
        =====
        
        ``pyppd`` is a CUPS PPD generator. It holds an compressed archive of PPDs, which
        can be listed and retrieved only when needed by CUPS, saving disk space.
        
        Instalation
        -----------
        
        To install ``pyppd``, run as root:
        
          python setup.py install
        
        It depends on Python 2.x (http://www.python.org) and XZ Utils
        (http://tukaani.org/xz/).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        At first, you have to create a PPD archive. For such, put all PPDs you want to
        add in the archive inside a single folder (which can have subfolders), then run:
        
          pyppd /path/to/your/ppd/folder
        
        It'll create ``pyppd-ppdfile`` in your current folder. You can test it by
        running:
        
          ./pyppd-ppdfile list
        
        And, for reading a PPD from the archive, simply do:
        
          ./pyppd-ppdfile cat pyppd-ppdfile:MY-PPD-FILE.PPD
        
        For CUPS to be able to use your newly-created archive, copy ``pyppd-ppdfile``
        to ``/usr/lib/cups/driver/`` and you're done.
