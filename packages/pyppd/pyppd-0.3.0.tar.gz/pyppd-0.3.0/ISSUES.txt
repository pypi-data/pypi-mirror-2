ISSUES
======

* ``setup.py install`` should link pyppd to /usr/lib/cups/driver, so CUPS'll
  begin using it.
* If ``pyppd`` does not find PPDs, issue a warning during compression run and
  let ``pyppd-ppdfile list`` do not output anything on stdout and a warning on
  stderr.
* Add logging facilities
* Add unit tests
* Check if the PPD filename don't exists in the index before inserting it, so
  we avoid overwritting an existing entry.
