        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jquery.qTip`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jquery.qTip`: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_qtip``) are published to some URL.
