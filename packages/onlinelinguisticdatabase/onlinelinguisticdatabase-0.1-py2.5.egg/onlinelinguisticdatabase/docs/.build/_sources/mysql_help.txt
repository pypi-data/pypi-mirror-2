1. Install MySQL if you can! 
    - Ubuntu: painless with Synaptic Pachage Manager
    - Mac OS X 10.5 (powerpc iBook): *** UNABLE TO INSTALL!!!??? ***
    - Windows XP: haven't tried


2. Start MySQL as root (you need a root password to do this):
    
    a. Enter:

        >mysql -u root -p

    b. Enter your password, then <RETURN>


4. Create OLD database called 'old':

    >create database old;


3. Add user to Mysql named 'old' with password 'old':

    b. While logged into MySQL as root, enter:

        >CREATE USER 'old'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'old';


4. Give 'old' user permission to work with 'old' database:

    >GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP ON old.* TO 'old'@'localhost';


4. Exit MySQL:

    >quit;


5. Make sure 'old' user works:

    a. Enter:

        >mysql -u old -p

    b. Enter 'old' as password, then <RETURN>

    c. View databases:

        >show databases;

    d. After the above command, you should see a table of databases (probably just two will be in there) and one will be called 'old'
