============================
Vtwt -- Ver's Twitter Client
============================


About
-----

Vtwt is a command-line interface to Twitter.  As of version 0.1.0, OAuth is the
only supported authentication mechanism.  The "oauth" subcommand can be used to
generate an OAuth authorization token for this client to access your Twitter
account.

Vtwt is released under an MIT license (see LICENSE).


Installation
------------

vtwt installs using a standard Python distutils setup.py:

  $ python setup.py install

Since vtwt is on the Python Package Index, it can also be installed with tools
like easy_install:

  $ easy_install vtwt


Configuration File
------------------

vtwt(1) reads a configuration file (~/.vtwtrc, by default; specified with the
--config-file option) that is used to set configuration values that are
otherwise passed to the command-line.  This file may contain arbitrary Python,
though there little reason for non-trivial logic to be there.  A typical vtwtrc
would look something like the following:

  oauth_token = "908a9f8d90af89809a8f"
  oauth_token_secret = "93084-908a9f8d908978798a7d87af797af89809a8f"
