Description: This package provides some core component for buildout based scrapy spider
        development. Such scrapy spider packages can get installed, scheduled and 
        processed with the mongodb based s01.worker daemon using the JSON-RPC proxy
        located in the s01.client package. The package also provides some recipes
        which allows to use external files as scrapy settings.
