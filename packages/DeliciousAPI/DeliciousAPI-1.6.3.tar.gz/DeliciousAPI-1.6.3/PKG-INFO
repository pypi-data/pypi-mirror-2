Description: This module provides the following features plus some more:
        
        * retrieving a URL's full public bookmarking history including
        * users who bookmarked the URL including tags used for such bookmarks
        and the creation time of the bookmark (up to YYYY-MM-DD granularity)
        * top tags (up to a maximum of 10) including tag count
        * title as stored on Delicious.com
        * total number of bookmarks/users for this URL at Delicious.com
        * retrieving a user's full bookmark collection, including any private bookmarks
        if you know the corresponding password
        * retrieving a user's full public tagging vocabulary, i.e. tags and tag counts
        * retrieving a user's network information (network members and network fans)
        * HTTP proxy support
        * updated to support Delicious.com "version 2" (mini-relaunch as of August 2008)
        
        The official Delicious.com API and the JSON/RSS feeds do not provide all
        the functionality mentioned above, and in such cases this module will query
        the Delicious.com *website* directly and extract the required information
        by parsing the HTML code of the resulting Web pages (a kind of poor man's
        web mining). The module is able to detect IP throttling, which is employed
        by Delicious.com to temporarily block abusive HTTP request behavior, and
        will raise a custom Python error to indicate that. Please be a nice netizen
        and do not stress the Delicious.com service more than necessary.
        
        It is strongly advised that you read the Delicious.com Terms of Use
        before using this Python module. In particular, read section 5
        'Intellectual Property'.
