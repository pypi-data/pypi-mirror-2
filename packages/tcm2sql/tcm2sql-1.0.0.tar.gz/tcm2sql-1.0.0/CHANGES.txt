==================

   - Eggified package.

   - Added entry point for console script.


0.9.2 (2006-10-18)
==================

    - Restructured renderer classes to make it easier to write
      renderers for other database managenemt systems.
    - Better handling for serials and bigserials: Now they are always
      written as integer with default + creation of sequence. (This
      makes updating of tables possible which have serial columns.)

    - Made usage help a bit nicer.
