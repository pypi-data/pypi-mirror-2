There are great projects aiming the same goal, including

* `woven`_ : quite similar, targets mainly Ubuntu, have more deployment options;
* `silverlining`_ : not tied to django and even python, targets Ubuntu,
  quite sophisticated.

django-fab-deploy targets Debian, have smaller codebase (x5..x10 less sloc),
provides less features and thus is arguably easier to understand.
