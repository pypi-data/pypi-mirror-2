          [davisagli]
        
        - When the user_registration_fields property is not there, fall back
          to an empty list; this avoids a TypeError on the registration form.

        1.0b3 - 2010-02-01
        ------------------
        
        - Retarget the registration and new-user forms at the navigation root.
          [mj]
        
        1.0b2 - 2010-01-28
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed tests to account for new layout of users overview pages. 
          [esteele]
        
        1.0b1 - 2009-12-27
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed package dependency declarations and use getSite from zope.site.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a3 - 2009-12-16
        ------------------
        
        - Make the password field optional for the admin when instead an email
          can be sent.
          [maurits]
        
        - On the anonymous registration form, do not offer to send an email
          with a link to reset your password if the password fields are right
          there on the form already; we were never actually sending emails
          with the plain password itself anyway.
          [maurits]
        
        - Allow admins to register a user at all times, also without valid
          mailhost settings.  This means that in a fresh Plone site you can
          create user accounts immediately without having to edit any
          settings.
          [maurits]
        
        - Use the proper SimpleVocabulary/SimpleTerm API instead of encouraging bad
          practice. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6480.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a2 - 2009-12-01
        ------------------
        
        - Display a message and prevent the user from registering if there is no
          defined mailhost and users are not allowed to select their own passwords.
          [esteele]
        
        - "User/Groups Settings" configlet view is polished visually to follow rest of 
          configlets in "Users and Groups" control panel. Ref. #9825
          [spliter]
        
        - For "User/Groups Settings" configlet highlighted "Member registration" tab 
          instead of the wrong "Settings"
          [spliter]
        
        - @@new-user form will now always show the password fields, regardless of the
          site settings. 
          [esteele]
        
        - Change registration form name @@join_form to @@register. Change class names
          accordingly. Added an "@@new-user" form to be used from the control panel.
          "Add to group" functionality now lives there. We can now get rid of the 
          horrid came_from flags that we've been passing around.
          [esteele]
        
        - Internationalized title_join_form_fields and description_join_form_fields.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/attachment/ticket/9810
          [vincentfretin]
        
        1.0a1 - 2009-11-18
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bad use of i18n markup in joinform.py. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9773
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Renamed label_groups to label_add_to_groups in joinform.py
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Restore the came_from_prefs check to make the join form redirect to the
          Users and Groups configlet if that's where the user started from.
