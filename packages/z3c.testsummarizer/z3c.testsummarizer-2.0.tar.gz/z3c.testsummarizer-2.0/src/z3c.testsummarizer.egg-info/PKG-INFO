        Script that checks a pipermail archive for recent messages, parses them
        according to a test result format and creates a summary.
        
        To use, write a configuration file like this::
        
          [testsummarizer]
          archive_url = https://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-tests/
          listname = zope-tests
          from = Zope tests summarizer <noreply@localhost>
          to = user@localhost
          smtpserver = localhost
        
        and then call ``test-summarizer example.ini``.
