        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jquery.ba-resize`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jquery.ba-resize`: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_ba_resize``) are published to some URL.
