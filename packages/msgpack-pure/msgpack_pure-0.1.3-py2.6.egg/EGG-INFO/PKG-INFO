Description: MessagePack (de)serializer for Python.
        
        What's MessagePack? (from http://msgpack.org/)
        
         MessagePack is a binary-based efficient data interchange format that is
         focused on high performance. It is like JSON, but very fast and small.
        
        I strongly recomment to use msgpack by INADA Naoki if you can,
        because it's core is written in C and much faster than msgpack-pure.
        msgpack-pure is for environments on which C-extention cannot be installed/compiled,
        including hosting, Windows and Google App Engine.
