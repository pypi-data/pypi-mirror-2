        =============
        
        What's this for
        ---------------
        
        The Django FormWizard was not exactly what we were looking for so we decided to
        scratch our own itch and create a project that would host different types
        of form wizards for use with Django. Currently we have a SessionWizard, which is
        a form wizard that is backed by the Django session object. This wizard provides
        the ability to use the SessionWizard as a callable in the URLConf but still
        provide thread safety.
        
        Besides the storage of SessionWizard state being in session, it uses an HTTP
        GET to render a form and a POST to process a form. This differs from the
        Django FormWizard which uses POST for everything. One benefit of this is the
        ability to got to previous steps in the wizard.
