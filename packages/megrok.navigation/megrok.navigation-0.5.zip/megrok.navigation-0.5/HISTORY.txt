0.5 (unreleased)
----------------
- use current grok version 1.1rc1.cfg
- now it's possible to register plain viewlets with the directive
  grok.viewletmanager to IMenu Items.
- added the layer directive (if setted) to IMenuItems
- register the components now with the default_view_name of the factory
  instead of the autogenerated name. This allows us to override simple
  MenuItems with the help of the ZCA.
