weave-python Readme
===================

This is a standalone client for the Weave server API implemented in Python.

It supports most of the User API and the read portions of the Sync API,
and has full support for decrypting encrypted browser object data.  Encryption
is not currently implemented.

It depends on the M2Crypto module, which is currently hosted at:

    http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto

M2Crypto is automatically installed in case you have Setuptools or Distribute
installed in your environment.

Discussion and documentation for Weave is found at the Mozilla Wiki:

    http://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave

You'll also find information there on how to join Weave mailing lists,
file bugs for Weave, and so forth.
