Changelog
=========

1.1 - 2010-07-18
----------------

* Add overlays.css. For Plone 3 only (it is disabled on installation in Plone
  4, and on upgrade from Plone 3 to Plone 4).
  [davisagli]

* Update license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]

* Added experimental windmill browser integration tests.
  [smcmahon]

1.1b5 - 2010-06-12
------------------

* Update to jQuery Tools 1.2.3.
  [smcmahon]

* Recode to one "var" per function standard.
  [smcmahon]

* Don't show empty ajax form responses, even if "noform" is not set.
  [smcmahon]

1.1b4 - 2010-06-06
------------------

* The select technique used to filter ajax response in b1-b3 was not robust
  if the responseText was not well-formed (think ZMI forms). Fixed by emulating
  the technique used in jQuery's .load method.
  [smcmahon]

1.1b3 - 2010-06-03
------------------

* Switch back to "find", undoing 1.1b2 change. 'filter' does not find
  descendents, and will thus not work in most validation error situations.
  Also, cleaned up identifiers and comments that suggested that we were
  filtering rather than selecting.
  [smcmahon]

1.1b2 - 2010-06-03
------------------

* Fix regression in filtering introduced in 1.1b1.
  [davisagli]

  to clarify its purpose.

  [davisagli]

* Made the closing of an ajax overlay delete the loaded content so that it
  doesn't muddy up the DOM. [smcmahon]

  on original page, which raised the overlay window) eg. in afterpost handler.
  [naro]

* Add message for ajax no response from server.
  [smcmahon]

* Insert overlays in the DOM at the end of body rather than visual
  portal wrapper. Fixes #10307.

-------------------

* Add beforepost and afterpost callback options for ajax forms.
  [smcmahon]

* Change reload strategy to set location to current href rather than using
  reload, which can cause repost queries on some browsers.
  [smcmahon]

1.0b13 - 2010-01-22
-------------------

* Fixed marshaling of submit buttons on AJAX submit when form has multiple
  buttons.
  [smcmahon]

1.0b12 - 2010-01-11
-------------------

* Allow noform and redirect options to be specified as callback functions.
