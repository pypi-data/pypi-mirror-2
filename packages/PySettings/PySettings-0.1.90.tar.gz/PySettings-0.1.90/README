What is PySettings?
===================

What?
-----

PySettings is a small library that provides settings support similar to that
found in Django.  It differs from Django in that it does not enforce
application-wide singletons.  This is often desirable when a long-running
application must accommodate several configurations simultaneously.

Why?
----

The author of PySettings found many small projects often included the same
cut-and-paste code for settings management.  Often settings were passed around
as a dictionary that was converted from a module.  These functions were simply
carried around to each new project in a form that made keeping them consistent.
The result is PySettings.
