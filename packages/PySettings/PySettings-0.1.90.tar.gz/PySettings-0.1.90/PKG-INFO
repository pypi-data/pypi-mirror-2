Description: A simple settings management package for Python.
        
        The syntax is modeled to feel familiar to those who have used Django before
        (although the internals probably vary greatly).  This package provides support
        for reading settings from various locations as well as merging settings (which
        is useful for loading default settings for an application and then overriding
        them).
