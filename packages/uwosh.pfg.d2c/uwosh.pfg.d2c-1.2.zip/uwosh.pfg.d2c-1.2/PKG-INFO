Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        uwosh.pfg.(d)ata(2)(c)ontent
        
        This product provides a dynamic content type to store PloneFormGen form
        data into. It leverages schemaextenders ability to dynamically add extra
        fields on a content type so that you essentially get a persistent copy of
        your form.
        
        The product adds a "Save Data to Content Adapter" item to the "Add
        new.." drop down for the PloneFormGen Form. Once enabled, when a user
        submits a form, a new content item is created with that data and
        located in the adapter.
        
        Saving Content
        --------------
        Upon save data adapter creation, user can choose to use any content type
        that has 'uwosh.pfg.d2c' configured as the 'product' in the FTI, to store
        the form submission. 
        
        So besides the original FormSaveData2ContentEntry, its clone types can
        also be used to store form data - whether added to types tool via code,
        genericsetup profile or by manually copying the FormSaveData2ContentEntry
        FTI in portal_types tool (and then renaming it appropriately).
        
        The type names can be translated simply by adding them to
        plone.po in the language-specific locale/LC_MESSAGES subdirectory.
        
        
        Warning
        -------
        
        Don't forget to enable the adapter after it is added to the form!
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Compatible with versions of PloneFormGen >= 1.2.2 and Plone 3.x ->
        4.0.
        
        Version 1.0 derives the new D2C saved data adapter from the BTree
        folder class.  This allows Plone 3.x sites to handle larger numbers of
        content items inside the D2C objects.  There is an upgrade step that
        allows pre-1.0 D2C objects to get migrated to BTree storage.  Version
        1.0 also works with Plone 4.  However, if you have a Plone 3.x site
        that uses pre-1.0 D2C and you upgrade to Plone 4 and only then upgrade
        to 1.0+ D2C, the upgrade step that migrates D2C storage to BTree
        storage may not work.  We recommend that you first upgrade to 1.0+ D2C
        *then* upgrade to Plone 4.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 - 2011-02-20
        ----------------
        
           - New feature: dynamic data entry title override via a TALES
             expression configurable in the save data adapter.
        
        1.1.1 - 2011-02-11
        ------------------
        
           - fix translations
             [saffe]
        
        1.1 - 2011-02-10
        ----------------
        
           - New feature: Any FTI clone of FormSaveData2ContentEntry type can be
             selected in the save adapter as the data content entry type to use.
             This makes it possible to apply different workflows, content rules
             etc. to content saved by different forms. [saffe]
        
        
        1.0 - 2011-01-06
        ----------------
        
          - New saved data adapter derives from large (BTree) folder instead
            of regular ones to handle better large numbers of contained items.
            Upgrade step migrates from obsolete normal/slow folder storage to
            the new BTree storage.
            [nguyen]
        
          - fixed issue where it couldn't render the title viewlet if a
            lines field was used for the title field. Convert all value
            fields to string for the title.
