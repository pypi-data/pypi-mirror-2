Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        uwosh.pfg.(d)ata(2)(c)ontent
        
        This product provides a dynamic content type to store PloneFormGen form
        data into. It leverages schemaextenders ability to dynamically add extra
        fields on a content type so that you essentially get a persistent copy of
        your form.
        
        The product adds a "Save Data to Content Adapter" item to the "Add new.." drop
        down for the PloneFormGen Form. Once enabled, when a user submits a form,
        a new content item is created with that data and located in the adapter.
        
        Compatible with versions of PloneFormGen >= 1.2.2 and Plone 3.x -> 4.0.
