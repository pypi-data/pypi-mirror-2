        =========
        
        Continued is a simple library for representing and operating on numbers
        represented as continued fractions.
        
        Bugs
        ====
        
        Plenty.
        
        - simplified() might be backwards.
        - Decimal decoding (or any other base, really) is missing.
        - Non-arithmetic operations are missing.
        - The API is too specialized towards simplified fractions.
        - sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) goes into an infinite loop, as does any other operation
        with an arbitrary string of 0.
