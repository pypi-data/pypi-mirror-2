TODO for LDAP PAS Plugins
=========================

Most important first:

- Caching of information to not do searches at every auth.

- More configuration to restrict searches to some objectClasses, and to
  specify a field for the principal's description.

- Debug/log functionnality so that an administrator can figure out
  what's wrong when it doesn't work (which happens often with LDAP :-).

- Search plugin: more configuration to decide when and if we do
  substring searches on some attributes.

- A subscriber that adds properties to a principal from LDAP its
  information.

- Search plugin: use LDAP schema introspection on objectClasses to
  display a nice search form tailored to the server.
