Description: ("=======\nChanges\n=======\n\n0.8.3 (2011-02-10)\n==================\n\n* Change conditional usage of ZCML registrations for views to use\n  'have' instead of 'installed' to account for consumers of zope.app.form\n   which aren't using the meta.zcml of that package.\n\n* Display this changelog on PyPI.\n\n0.8.2 (2011-01-25)\n==================\n\n* Actually *remove* zope.app.testing from the non-testing dependencies!\n\n0.8.1 (2011-01-25)\n==================\n\n* Make registration of ZCML forms conditional on the presence of\n  zope.app.form. This is probably a deprecated feature by now.\n\n0.8 (2011-01-25)\n================\n\n* Changes to use the ZTK import locations.\n\n* Use newer version of openldap for test builds.\n\n* zest.releaser support in buildout\n\n* Reduce dependencies. zope.app.testing dependency still exists, though,\n  and should be removed by adjusting the tests.\n\n0.7 - 04.07.2008\n================\n\n* Updated install_requires to include all dependencies.\n \n* Removed deprecated localUtility ZCML.\n \n* buildout.cfg compiles openldap and creates a python-ldap egg\n\n* Compatible with Grok 0.12 and 0.13 releases.\n\n0.6 - 20.11.2006\n================\n\n* Fixed Zope 3.3 induced deprecation warnings.\n\n* principalInfo will try to look up a group if it cannot find a\n  user. This is to make ldappas support groups in a minimal way. It is\n  still the responsibility of the application to add LDAP-based groups\n  to the principal (for instance by subscribing to the\n  IAuthenticatedPrincipalCreated).\n",)
