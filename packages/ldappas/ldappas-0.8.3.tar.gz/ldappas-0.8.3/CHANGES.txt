0.8.3 (2011-02-10)
==================

* Change conditional usage of ZCML registrations for views to use
  'have' instead of 'installed' to account for consumers of zope.app.form
   which aren't using the meta.zcml of that package.

* Display this changelog on PyPI.

0.8.2 (2011-01-25)
==================

* Actually *remove* zope.app.testing from the non-testing dependencies!

0.8.1 (2011-01-25)
==================

* Make registration of ZCML forms conditional on the presence of
  zope.app.form. This is probably a deprecated feature by now.

0.8 (2011-01-25)
================

* Changes to use the ZTK import locations.

* Use newer version of openldap for test builds.

* zest.releaser support in buildout

* Reduce dependencies. zope.app.testing dependency still exists, though,
  and should be removed by adjusting the tests.

0.7 - 04.07.2008
================

* Updated install_requires to include all dependencies.
 
* Removed deprecated localUtility ZCML.
 
* buildout.cfg compiles openldap and creates a python-ldap egg

* Compatible with Grok 0.12 and 0.13 releases.

0.6 - 20.11.2006
================

* Fixed Zope 3.3 induced deprecation warnings.

* principalInfo will try to look up a group if it cannot find a
  user. This is to make ldappas support groups in a minimal way. It is
  still the responsibility of the application to add LDAP-based groups
  to the principal (for instance by subscribing to the
  IAuthenticatedPrincipalCreated).
