Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Viewlet that shows all the references to the current article including back references, by defult it is registered to IBelowContent.
        For now, it has a hard dependency on collective.contentleadimage and collective.flowplayer. This means you have to install those products in order for References to work.
        
        Used in production in http://www.v2.nl/
        
        To choose which types should use the viewlet go to ZMI -> portal_properties -> references_properties and add the types on apply_to separated by a space.
