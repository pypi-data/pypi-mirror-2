Description: Python bindings for Ecore and Ecore/Evas, part of Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.
        
        Ecore is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer that
        makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops,
        timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a
        separate library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to
        make this job easy for applications.
        
        Ecore/Evas binds Evas to its underlying output and event systems, like
        X, Framebuffer, DirectFB, OpenGL and possible more, taking care of
        converting events to an uniform structure and handling them to
        applications, also updating the screen when necessary (expose events,
        for instance), toggling fullscreen, setting window shape, border and
        other parameters.
        
        Ecore/X is acts on low-level X11 API, providing resources like XDamage,
        XFixes, window management and more.
