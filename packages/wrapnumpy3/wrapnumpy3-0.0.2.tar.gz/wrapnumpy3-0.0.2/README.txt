README.txt - wrapnumpy3
========================

Introduction
=============

You will need numpy and Python 3.2 or higher readily installed. Please also refer to "quickStart.pdf" in the wrapnp3-pdf directory.
To install this wrapnumpy3 module, issue the following command::

  sudo python3 setup.py install

On a kubuntu 11.04 "natty" platform the module and its test unit are installed in::

  /usr/local/lib/python3.2/dist-packages/wrapnumpy3/

The directory **wrapnumpy3** is created by the **setup.py install** command and the files are copied to it. Of course, **Your Mileage May Vary** depending on the platform. The module is designed to work with Python 3.2 or higher.

Included with the package are **Quick Start**, **User Manual** and 
**Reference Manual** in pdf format. Please read this information at your leasure. The pdf files are in the wrapnp3-pdf sub-directory. The author of this package can be contacted by email at the following address::

If you have suggestions that you think should be incorporated into the package, bugs in the documentation and (heaven forbid!) the program, kindly write to me. All suggestions will be  considered.

Good computing!
