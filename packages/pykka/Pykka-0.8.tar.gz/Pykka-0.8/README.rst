Pykka
=====

The goal of Pykka is to provide easy to use concurrency abstractions for Python
by using the `actor model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`_.

Pykka is built on the `gevent <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ library. gevent is a
coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlet to provide a
high-level synchronous API on top of libevent event loop.

Much of the naming in Pykka is inspired by the `Akka <http://akka.io/>`_
project which implements actors on the JVM. Though, Pykka does not aim to be a
Python port of Akka.
