SYNOPSIS
========

cloudtask-launch-workers [ -opts ] howmany ( path/to/list-of-ips | - )

DESCRIPTION
===========

Launch new cloud workers and write list of addresses to a file.

cloudtask can launch and destroy cloud workers automatically when
needed, but it can also accept a list of pre-allocated workers via the
--workers option. This command launches workers and creates a list of
addresses which you can feed to cloudtask. This allows you to manage the
pool of workers for a task or series of tasks by hand, which may be
desirable for various reasons (e.g., launching workers takes time,
billing is performed at a 1-hour resolution, etc.)

ARGUMENTS
=========

`howmany` := number of workers to launch

`path/to/list-of-ips` := file location to save IP addresses of launched
workers. If '-' then print addresses to stdout.
