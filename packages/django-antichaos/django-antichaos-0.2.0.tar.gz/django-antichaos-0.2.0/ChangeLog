django-antichaos changes
========================

0.2.0
-----

* A special box was added on the tag cloud page. This box
  always floats around. When there are many tags, it is
  useful to place a few in this box, and then drop other
  tags on them, to merge.

0.1.9
-----

* Now command 'merge' can skip missing tags.
* Fixed tag merging for usual tagging (not for tagging-ng).

0.1.8
-----

* Now we use 'tagging.utils.merge' function, when working with
  django-tagging-ng, cause it is able to create synonyms from deleted
  tags. So tagging-ng must be >= 0.3.2.

0.1.7
-----

* Fixed name of admin view to work with Django trunk. admin_index -> admin:index.
* Fixed default JSON URL.
* Fixed error on saving unicode strings to the file.
* Fixed default JSON URL.

0.1.6
-----

* Added management command `antichaos_process_rules` to
  run previously saved rules on the database.
* Added ability to store commands in a separate directory
  to reapply them using management command.
* Fixed error with multilingual tag processing, when there
  is no default tag name and need to use fallback instead.

0.1.5
-----

* Client side tagcloud calculation was added, now all tags
  have proper sizes after merge.
* Added UNDO for all operations.

0.1.4
-----

* Fixed annoying word wrapping in the tag cloud.
* Added support of language fallback for multilingual tags.

0.1.3
-----

* Support for trunk of the plain django-tagging (from
  http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/)
* Added buildout section to create separate django and tests
  runners for plaing tagging and tagging-ng.

0.1.2
-----

* Fixed missing 'media' directory was added to MANIFEST.in
* Removed limit on 'objects' count for tag preview. Use 'slice'
  filter in the template.
* Added ability to override `tag_preview.html` and `tag_cloud.html`
  for model or application.
* Added AJAX pager to the preview. Also, number of previews can be
  changed in template `tag_cloud.html`. To do that, override
  `init-antichaos` block.

0.1.1
-----

* Added templates missing in distribution.

0.1.0
-----

* First public release.
