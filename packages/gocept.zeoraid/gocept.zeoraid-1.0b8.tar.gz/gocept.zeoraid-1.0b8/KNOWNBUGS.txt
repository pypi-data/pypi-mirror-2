Known bugs and issues

Restrictions when running parallel ZEORaid servers
==================================================

Some actions within ZEORaid are not allowed to be performed in parallel with
other actions (such as packing and recovery or multiple recoveries). 

When running parallel ZEORaid servers those actions are not enforced to not
happen in parallel on multiple ZEORaid servers and caution must be taken
manually.

Compatibility with ZODB `versions`
==================================

ZEORaid is not compatible with ZODB's `version` feature as it is deprecated
and actively being removed.

ZEORaid has API-compatibility with those releases of the ZODB that provide and
use versions but will actively prevent any usage of the version features.
