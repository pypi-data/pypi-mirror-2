Description: Adds the url /count/<<fieldname>>/<<bagname>> which allows you to list the different values of a field or tag alongside the number of times they occur.
        
        Results are returned as a new line separated list with the tag on the left and the number of occurances on the right of the last trailing whitespace.
        tag1 42
        tag2 12
        tag3 4
        You can limit the number of results returned by the use of a max querystring
        eg. /count/tag/bag?max=2 in the above example would return
        tag1 42
        tag2 12
        
        Based on work by Jonathan Lister to count tags
