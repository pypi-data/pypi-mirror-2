Description: Plone Faceted Navigation product
        ================================
        A powerful and effective way to find content in large collections
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Faceted Navigation (FN) gives you a very powerful interface to improve
        search within large collections of items. It lets you gradually
        select and explore different facets (metadata) of the site content and
        narrow down you search dynamically.
        
        On the contrary plone collections are static, in a way that the site admin
        decide the search criteria and the end user is not able to
        further sort or filter the presented results.
        
        FN is fully customizable, site admin may decide that some criteria (facets)
        must have fixed values while other may be presented as
        filter options to the web visitor.
        
        FN may very well replace the standard collection content type, since it covers
        same functionality and it adds a lot more features.
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        FN can also be used as an advanced search for your site.
        It comes with plenty of configuration options and features like:
        
           1. Easy customisable GUI via drag-n-drop, no restart needed.
           2. Facets can be set to fixed default values and hidden.
           3. Facets can be placed in standard search or extended
              search panels, to not intimidate novice users and have cleaner interface
           4. Facets can be displayed via several widgets like select,
              radio, text input, tag cloud, date range and more
           5. Expandable and collapsable widgets with many values
           6. Automatically counts number of content items beside each facet value
           7. Possibility to show or hide the options with zero results
             (show only the facets which return content)
           8. Ability to create your custom content types definition to be used
              as a combination of interface and portal type, presented in a single widget.
           9. Export of search result in RSS.
          10. Pleasant user interface based on Ajax JQuery, implemented with "deep linking",
              so bookmarking a faceted query works, browser history supported.
          11. Export / Import of faceted settings as XML. Useful to replicate same facets
              navigation on another site.
          12. Search engine friendly, disabling javascript acts as a normal
              collection batch list.
          13. Synchronisation of settings across multiple languages, I18N support.
          14. High performance by caching faceted catalog queries via distributed
              memory object caching system: memcached
