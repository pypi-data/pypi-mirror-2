        What is the motivation behind the project?
        ------------------------------------------
        
        To provide a tool to quickly review new/old vocabulary, definitions
        and other stuff which can be resumed in under 200 words.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Usually:
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        should do it. If you don't have root access, then issue the following
        command:
        
          $ python setup.py install --user
        
        
        Builing it out
        --------------
        
        This project is developed with the help of buildout [1], vim, and a lot
        of love.
        
        Generally, to replicate my working environment, issue the following commands:
        
          $ python bootstrap.py && ./bin/buildout
        
        This may take some time, but believe me it's worth it. :-)
