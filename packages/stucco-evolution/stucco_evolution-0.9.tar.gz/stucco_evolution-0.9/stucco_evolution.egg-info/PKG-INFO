Description: stucco_evolution
        ----------------
        
        SQLAlchemy manager for repoze.evolution. Provides a simple way to
        implement schema migrations as a package of numbered Python scripts.
        
        ``stucco_evolution`` keeps a table with (packagename, version) tuples and
        will pass a SQLAlchemy session to numbered evolveN.py scripts to bring
        the schema for ``packagename`` up-to-date. All you have to do is write
        the Python and SQL needed to make that happen.

        - Rename to stucco_evolution
        - stucco_evolution's own upgrade() will now deletage all
          stucco_evolution.Base.metadata.crete_all(session) to the evolveN.py
          scripts. This avoids 'DROP TABLE' statements when an upgrade includes
          table renames.

        ------
        
        - Improved packagibility (MANIFEST.in specified)
        - SQLAlchemyEvolutionManager no longer calls session.commit(); this is
          your responsibility after the migration has completed.
