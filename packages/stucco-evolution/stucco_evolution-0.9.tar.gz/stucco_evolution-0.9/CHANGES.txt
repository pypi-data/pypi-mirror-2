- Rename to stucco_evolution
- stucco_evolution's own upgrade() will now deletage all
  stucco_evolution.Base.metadata.crete_all(session) to the evolveN.py
  scripts. This avoids 'DROP TABLE' statements when an upgrade includes
  table renames.

- Improved packagibility (MANIFEST.in specified)
- SQLAlchemyEvolutionManager no longer calls session.commit(); this is
  your responsibility after the migration has completed.
