Django-Balancer
===============

A set of tools for using Django's multi-db feature to balance database requests
between multiple replicated databases.  It currently provides a router for 
weighted random selection from a database pool, and a router for weighted
random selection in a master/slave configuration.

Coming soon:

    * Basic random selection
    * Database 'pinning' after writes using the currently configured cache 
      backend.
