Django-Balancer
===============

A set of tools for using Django's multi-db feature to balance database requests
between multiple replicated databases.  It currently provides some basic
routers for using weighted random selection or round robin selection with a
pool of databases, following a master/slave layout where the slaves are
read-only copies of master, and pinning reads to master for a user after that
user completes a write.

Since everything is implemented using base classes and mixins, this also serves
as a construction kit for creating your own more complex routers.  Feel free to
contribute routers, and I'll be happy to incorporate them into the project.
