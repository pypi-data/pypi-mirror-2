Description: Django-Balancer
        ===============
        
        A set of tools for using Django's multi-db feature to balance database requests
        between multiple replicated databases.  It currently provides some basic
        routers for using weighted random selection or round robin selection with a
        pool of databases, following a master/slave layout where the slaves are
        read-only copies of master, and pinning reads to master for a user after that
        user completes a write.
        
        Since everything is implemented using base classes and mixins, this also serves
        as a construction kit for creating your own more complex routers.  Feel free to
        contribute routers, and I'll be happy to incorporate them into the project.
