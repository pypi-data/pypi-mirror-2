version 0.92.5
- labrad.client: separated Client from Connection so that multiple Clients
    can share a single connection.  These clients can have separate contexts
    to allow for all requests made on that client to be in a different
    default context. 

- labrad.gpib: added the ability to optionally set a temporary timeout for each read/write/query operation
- labrad.gpib: fixed bug with DeviceLockedError exception type not being imported

- labrad.types: removed dynamic class generation magic from LazyList (now pickleable)
- labrad.units: removed dynamic class generation magic from WithUnit (now pickleable)

- labrad.controller: package removed
- labrad.util.simplejson: package removed
