Description: Introduction

        This product allows to re-use a Gallery view (from
        collective.plonetruegallery_) of a Collection in a Collage_.
        
        .. _collective.plonetruegallery: http://www.plone.org/products/plone-true-gallery
        .. _Collage: http://www.plone.org/products/collage
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add to buildout.cfg::
            
            eggs +=
                collective.collage.plonetruegallery
        
        No further configuration is required.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        First, configure the collective.plonetruegallery_ behaviour: Set the default
        view of a Collection to "Gallery View", and configure it.
        
        Next, in the Collage's "Compose" view, "browse" to that Collection. When it is
        added to the Collage, select the "gallery-view" layout.
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Tested with:
        
        * Plone 4.0
        * Products.Collage 1.3
        * collective.plonetruegallery >= 1.0.2
        
        To do
        =====
        
        - Presently, when the "gallery-view" layout is selected, the Collage block's
          buttons are not shown. The only way to change the layout is to remove and
          re-add the block.
