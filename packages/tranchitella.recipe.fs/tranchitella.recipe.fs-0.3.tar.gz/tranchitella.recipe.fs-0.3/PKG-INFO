Description: tranchitella.recipe.fs
        ======================
        
        This recipe creates files and directories in a buildout.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This recipe offers the following entry points:
        
        * mkdir
        * mkfile
        
        mkdir
        ~~~~~
        
        This is a minimal ``buildout.cfg`` which makes use of the ``mkdir`` recipe::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = dirs
        
        [dirs]
        recipe = tranchitella.recipe.fs:mkdir
        paths =
        ${buildout:directory}/var
        ${buildout:directory}/var/lib
        ${buildout:directory}/var/tmp
        ${buildout:directory}/var/log
        
        This will create the directories specified by the ``paths`` attribute.
        
        mkfile
        ~~~~~~
        
        This is a minimal ``buildout.cfg`` which makes use of the ``mkfile`` recipe::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = conffiles
        
        [conffiles]
        recipe = tranchitella.recipe.fs:mkfile
        template = ${buildout:directory}/templates/config
        path = ${buildout:directory}/etc/config
        mode = 0644
        database = postgres
        
        This will create the file specified by the ``path`` attribute using the given
        template; the file will be customized using string interpolations of the
        options specified in the buildout part (eg. ``%(database)s`` will be replaced
        with the string ``postgres``).
        
        
        0.3 (2010-03-23)
        ================
        
        - Do not consider directory and files as "created" by buildout, otherwise they
        will be automatically removed by buildout when the recipe is uninstalled.
        
        - Added logging
        
        0.2 (2010-03-07)
        ================
        
        - Added a new recipe entry point ``mkfile``.
        
        0.1 (2010-02-29)
        ================
        
        - Initial release.
