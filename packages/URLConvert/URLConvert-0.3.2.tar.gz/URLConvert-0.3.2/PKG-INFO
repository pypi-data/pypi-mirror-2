        Summary
        =======
        
        * A URL conversion and generation library based on ConversionKit 
        
        Get Started
        ===========
        
        In addition to URLConvert itself, you'll need each of the dependencies below:
        
        .. include :: ../requires.txt
           :literal:
        
        If you are using ``pip`` you can pass easy dependency as an argument to the
        ``pip install`` command or install them all in one go using the
        ``requires.txt`` file in the root of the source distribution like so:
        
        ::
        
            pip install -r requires.txt
