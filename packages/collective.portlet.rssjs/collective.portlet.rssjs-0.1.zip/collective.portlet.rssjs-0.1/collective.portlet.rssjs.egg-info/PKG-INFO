Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Using the standard **RSS Feed** Portlet of Plone,
        you may end up in blocked Zope threads when the
        requested URLs are not responding in a sensible time.
        This alternative prohibits this by doing
        the work on the client.
        
        Abstract
        --------
        
        **collective.portlet.rssjs** adds a new Portlet
        **RSS Feed (JS)** to the Plone Site.
        
        This portlet uses the **GOOGLE FEEDS API**
        via ajax to get and parse rss feeds.
        
        As a boilerplate
        
        http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jgfeed
        
        was used.
        
        The dom is manipulated on the client to add the
        Feed Items.
        
        The portlet has the same markup as the std Plone
        **RSS Feed** portlet.
