- Add sharing screen.

  This allows you to set roles for groups and users on individual
  folders.  This also considers roles that are inherited from higher
  up in the hierarchy, and those that are inherited from groups that
  the user belongs to.

- Refined available system roles in ``kotti.security.ROLES``.  We now
  have:

  - Viewer: view
  - Editor: view, add, edit
  - Owner: view, add, edit, manage
  - Admin: all permissions

0.1a4
-----

- Added login form.

  With the development profile in ``development.ini``, log in with
  user 'admin' and password 'qwerty'.  User management and sharing tab
  is a TODO.

- Add a default user database implementation in
  ``kotti.security.Principals``.
  
  Override with ``kotti.principals`` configuration setting.

- Add inheritbale, nested groups support.
  
  Groups are stored in ``Node.__groups__``.  The API is
  ``kotti.security.list_groups`` and ``kotti.security.set_groups``.
