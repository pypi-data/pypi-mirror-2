Description: ==========
        CEF logger
        ==========
        
        
        Most Mozilla Services applications need to generate CEF logs. A CEF Log is a
        formatted log that can be used by ArcSight, a central application used
        by the infrasec team to manage application security.
        
        The *cef* module provide a `log_cef` function that can be used to
        emit CEF logs:
        
            log_cef(message, severity, environ, config, [username,
                    [signature]], \*\*kw)
        
            Creates a CEF record, and emit it in syslog or another file.
        
            Args:
                - message: message to log
                - severity: integer from 0 to 10
                - environ: the WSGI environ object
                - config: configuration dict
                - signature: CEF signature code, defaults to 'AuthFail'
                - username: user name, defaults to 'none'
                - extra keywords: extra keys used in the CEF extension
        
        Example::
        
            >>> from cef import log_cef
            >>> log_cef('SecurityAlert!', 5, environ, config,
            ...         msg='Someone has stolen my chocolate')
        
        
        With *environ* and *config* provided by the web environment.
