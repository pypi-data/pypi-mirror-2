        About
        =====
        
        After using web2py for quite a while I have an eclectic mix of utilities that 
        I seem to be using for almost every web2py app I develop now!
        
        I needed both a way to organize the same code across multiple web2py apps and I
        also wanted to share this code with the world!
        
        Lots of Goodies!
