Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package enables `Collage
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Collage>`_ to support nested Collage objects.
        
        Additionally, two views (Collage layouts) are available:
        
        * **Full**: displays exactly the same as a Collage default view, including
          title, description, related items and, of course, the contents (rows 
          and columns).
        
        * **Content**: displays only contents (rows and columns).
        
        To allow Collage objects to be created inside columns we had to patch
        ``enabledType`` and ``enabledAlias`` methods in 
        ``Products.Collage.browser.controlpanel.CollageSiteOptions``
        to allow `Collage` content type to be inserted in a ``Column``.
        
        Additionally, a CSS resource is registered (just below the original 
        ``collage.css``) to display nested column widths correctly.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        If you want to create new views (layouts) for nested collage objects
        base your class on the new ``NestedCollageView`` one, like this::
        
            from collective.collage.browser.views import NestedCollageView
        
            class MyNestedCollageView(NestedCollageView):
                """ A custom view for a nested collage """
                ...
        
        
        Known issues
        ============
        
        Ideally ``Products.Collage.config.COLLAGE_TYPES`` should be patched 
        however ``collage.vocabularies.CollageUserFriendlyTypes`` doesn't seem to notice
        the change, so Collage control panel doesn't display ``Collage`` as an allowed
        portal type. Patches are applied to ``enabledAlias`` and ``enabledType`` instead.
