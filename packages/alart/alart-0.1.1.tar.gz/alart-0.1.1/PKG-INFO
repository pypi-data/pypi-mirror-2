        License
        =======
        
        alart is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License
        version 3 (or any later version). This is version 0.1.1 (codename: "Fox") of
        the program.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Way #1
        ------
        
        Get the newest version of alart at http://metanohi.name/projects/alart/ or at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/alart
        
        Extract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::
        
          # python setup.py install
        
        Examples can then be found in the ``examples`` directory.
        
        
        Way #1
        ------
        
        Just run this::
        
          # pip install alart
        
        or::
        
          # easy_install alart
        
        Note that this will not make the examples available.
        
          
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Python 2.5 is required, though newer versions might be needed for Encapsulated
        PostScript support.
        
        alart depends on cairo and cairo's Python bindings for generating
        images. Version 1.6 is needed for best output support, but earlier versions
        (e.g. 1.4) works ok. To install it, do one of these things:
        
        * For DEB-based distros (Debian etc.): type ``apt-get install python-cairo``
        * For RPM-based distros (Fedora etc.): type ``yum install pycairo``
        * For other distros: do something similar or get it at
          http://cairographics.org/download/
        
        alart depends on PyGame 1.8.0+ (perhaps earlier versions are also supported)
        for showing generated images. If you only want to generate images and not show
        them in an interactive window, you do not need PyGame graphics and sound. To
        install it, do one of these things:
        
        * For DEB-based distros (Debian etc.): type ``apt-get install python-pygame``
        * For RPM-based distros (Fedora etc.): type ``yum install pygame``
        * For other distros: do something similar or get it at
          http://pygame.org/download.shtml
        
        
        Use
        ===
        
        To use alart, just run ``alart``. This will display a generated image with
        default options. To generate a new image while in the window, press R.
        
        To see a list of alart's command-line options with explanations, run ``alart
        --help``. To see alart's module help, run ``pydoc alart``.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        alart uses Git for code management. To get the newest code, run::
        
          $ git clone git://gitorious.org/alart/alart.git
