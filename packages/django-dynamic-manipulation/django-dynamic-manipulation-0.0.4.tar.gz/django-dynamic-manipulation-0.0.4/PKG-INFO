Description: 
        
        Django Dynamic Manipulation
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        depends on:
          - django-dynamic-rules: an app that allows you to create dynamic rules
              related to a particular model.
              https://github.com/imtapps/django-dynamic-rules
        
        When a dynamic rule is triggered, it can use a Dynamic Manipulation to
        create some other model (referred to as a side effect model). When the
        rules are run all of the side effect models will be deleted and re-created
        if necessary (as determined by the rule).
        
        A manipulation log keeps track of the rule, side effect model, and the
        model that triggered the side effect. This is how we know what changes
        occurred as a result of the dynamic rule.
        
        See the example app for a sample of what this might look
        in a shopping cart application. There are lettuce tests that
        clearly show a simplified shopping cart use case.
        
        (run "./manage.py harvest -a sample -S" to run the lettuce tests)
