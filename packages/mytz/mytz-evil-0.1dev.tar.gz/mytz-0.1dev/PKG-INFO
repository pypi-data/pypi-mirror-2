        ====
        
        The original idea for this was based on my work on Rodrigo Moraes' `gae-pytz`_.
        Limitations within pytz caused its performance to be unacceptable for
        short-running applications, such as in Google App Engine. The issue, and
        related issues to do with this remain un-addressed today.
        
        The crux of this issue is based around the "all_timezones" and
        "common_timezones" variables, which cause the entire timezone list to be loaded
        (well over five hundred!) at import time. Beause it's done in __init__.py, it
        cannot be avoided without hacks such as gae-pytz.
        
        So this is a fork, but intends to be a drop-in replacement for the most part
        for pytz. In the process will be a number of code cleanups, and unit testing.
