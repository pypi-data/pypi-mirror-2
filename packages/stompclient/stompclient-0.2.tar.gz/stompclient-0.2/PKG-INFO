Summary: 
stompclient is a STOMP message client written in Python.

stompclient supports bot simplex (publisher-only) and duplex (publish-subscribe)
communication with STOMP servers. This project started as a fork of the stompy
project by Benjamin W. Smith U{https://bitbucket.org/asksol/python-stomp} but 
has evolved into a very distinct codebase, which combines a few  aspects of 
stompy with features from Stomper and CoilMQ.
