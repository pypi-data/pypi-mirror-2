 * Added boolean `binary` argument to .write() with default False.
   If binary=True, use_newline:=False, and the file is written in
   mode='wb' instead of mode='w'.
 
 * Don't import backend from sven/__init__.py, so that `import sven`
   will not fail if pysvn isn't installed.

 * Added support for reading and writing revprops in bzr.py backend.
