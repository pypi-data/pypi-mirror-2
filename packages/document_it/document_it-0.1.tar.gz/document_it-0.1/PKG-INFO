Description: # DocumentIt
        
        DocumentIt renders [markdown]() syntax to HTML and uploads it to the 
        [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
        
        It is run by:
        
            document-it [options] manifest [manifest] [...]
        
        See `document-it --help` for options.  It will render to a local
        temporary directory by default but you can specify its output with
        `--dest` (although you will need to pass `--user` and `--password` to
        POST data).
        
        
        ## Manifests
        
        A manifest is in the form:
        
            relative_file_path    page_name
            ...
        
        The file path is relative to the manifest.
        
        (*TODO: more columns of options may be added in subsequent release to
        e.g. specify input format and expand macros)
        
        An example manifest is at
        http://k0s.org/mozilla/hg/DocumentIt/file/tip/example.manifest
        
        
        ## TODO
        
        Currently, to POST, DocumentIt assumes `curl` is available on the
        path. This is an obvious deficiency and it should be replaced with a
        request from (e.g.) `urllib2`.
        
        In addition to http://developer.mozilla.org it would be nice to POST
        to `http://wiki.mozilla.org` as well.  This would allow staging
        documents at `wiki.mozilla.org` and then moving to MDN.
        
        There are other features that would be nice to have:
        
        - inclusion of other files
        - inclusion of `--help` documentation
        
        In general the approach taken shouldn't compromise the general
        approach that the documentation should be the documentation, not
        pre-documentation.  This may be achieved by the use of (e.g. regex)
        macros.  For instance:
        
            append(--help.*$,shell(mozmill --help))
