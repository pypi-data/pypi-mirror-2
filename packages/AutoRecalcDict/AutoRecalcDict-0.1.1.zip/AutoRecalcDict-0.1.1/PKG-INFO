Description: ==============
        AutoRecalcDict
        ==============
        
        An AutoRecalcDict is a subclass of dict that allows the user to create a
        standard python dict, but to also allow specifications for dependency
        lists that are on specific targets. Typical usage would be when
        you want a dict entry to automagically be recomputed if a dependency
        changes.
        
        For example:
        ============
        
        ard is an AutoRecalcDict and has keys called 'target', 'dep1', 'dep2' and
        'dep3'. The user wants the value of ard['target'] to be recomputed via
        a user defined function ff.
        
        The calling sequence of function ff is defined as having three
        arguments:
        1. self (ff will be converted to an instance method of ard)
        2. target (the index into ard)
        3. deplist (the list of keys that target depends upon).
        
        Included in autorecalcdict.py is a class called DepDescFunc. This is 
        used to create the instance needed by AutoRecalcDict to know what
        targets are dependent on which dependency lists and the function
        needed to update the target.
        
        See the module for examples of usage.
