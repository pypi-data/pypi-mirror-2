        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a full-blown functional test. The emphasis here is on testing what
        the user may input and see, and the system is largely tested as a black box.
        We use PloneTestCase to set up this test as well, so we have a full Plone site
        to play with. We *can* inspect the state of the portal, e.g. using
        self.portal and self.folder, but it is often frowned upon since you are not
        treating the system as a black box. Also, if you, for example, log in or set
        roles using calls like self.setRoles(), these are not reflected in the test
        browser, which runs as a separate session.
        
        Being a doctest, we can tell a story here.
        
        First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
        with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the
        documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.
        
        >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
        >>> browser = Browser()
        >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()
        
        The following is useful when writing and debugging testbrowser tests. It lets
        us see all error messages in the error_log.
        
        >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()
        
        With that in place, we can go to the portal front page and log in. We will
        do this using the default user from PloneTestCase:
        
        >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.setup import portal_owner, default_password
        
        >>> browser.open(portal_url)
        
        We have the login portlet, so let's use that.
        
        >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = portal_owner
        >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
        >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()
        
        Here, we set the value of the fields on the login form and then simulate a
        submit click.
        
        We then test that we are still on the portal front page:
        
        >>> browser.url == portal_url
        True
        
        And we ensure that we get the friendly logged-in message:
        
        >>> "You are now logged in" in browser.contents
        True
        
        
        -*- extra stuff goes here -*-
