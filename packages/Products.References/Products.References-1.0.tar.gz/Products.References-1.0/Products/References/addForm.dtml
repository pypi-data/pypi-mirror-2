<h1>Add Reference</h1>
<p>A Reference is an object refering to a target. It behaves almost
as the target but has a few attributes of its own and especially
its own management pages.</p>

<p>A Reference is very similar to an instance of Shane's <code>Symlink</code>
product. Unlike a <code>Symlink</code>, a Reference is easily distinguishable
from the refered to target.</p>

<p>The target is identified by the target path. It is resolved
with respect to the Reference's parent.</p>
