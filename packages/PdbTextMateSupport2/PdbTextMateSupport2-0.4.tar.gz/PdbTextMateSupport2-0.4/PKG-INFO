Description: This module is used to hook up pdb_, the python debugger, with TextMate_, an
        advanced text and programming editor for Mac OS, enabling it to display the
        debugged source code during a pdb_ session.
        
        .. _pdb: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html
        .. _TextMate: http://macromates.com/
        
        After downloading and unpacking the package, you should install the helper
        module using::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        Next you need to hook up pdb_ with this module by add the following to your
        ``.pdbrc``::
        
        from PdbTextMateSupport import preloop, precmd
        pdb.Pdb.preloop = preloop
        pdb.Pdb.precmd = precmd
        
        The easiest way to do this is to use the provided script::
        
        $ pdbtmsupport enable
        
        Alternatively you can also do it manually.  The ``.pdbrc`` is located in your
        home folder and possibly needs to be created first.  You may also use the
        supplied sample configuration file for pdb_ to enable the hook like::
        
        $ cp pdbrc.sample ~/.pdbrc
        
        Afterwards TextMate_ should get started automatically whenever you enter a
        debug session.  The current source line will be displayed simultaneously while
        stepping through the code.  However, having the cursor moved automatically
        within that source file is not always very obvious, so you might want to use
        the "Highlight current line" feature, which can be enabled in the "General"
        tab in TextMate's preferences.
        
        Note that due to the original owner not responding, I (Matthew Schinckel)
        have re-released this into the cheeseshop, under a modified name.
        
        The original package can still be found at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PdbTextMateSupport/0.3
