Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is the plone.org site package and corresponding buildout. It is used to
        power http://plone.org. It is also a great buildut for working on developing 
        Plone.org centric products such as PloneSoftwareCenter, PloneHelpCenter, and
        PloneServicesCenter.

        The current supported version of Plone is: 4.1.x.
        
        
        Production
        ----------
        
        The default buildout setup is for setting up a production environment,
        including Plone and nginx running under supervisor. (This won't be
        functional without extra work, as other parts of the plone.org stack
        such as the load balancer are not currently in the buildout.)
        Run buildout as normal::
        
            $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
            $ sudo bin/supervisord
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        To build plone.org for development, comment out the line in buildout.cfg that
        says 'conf/production.cfg' and uncomment 'conf/develop.cfg'. Then proceed as
        normal::
        
            $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
            $ bin/instance fg
        
        This will get you an unthemed copy of the site. If you want to work on the
        theme, you can build Plone + nginx by modifying buildout.cfg to use 
        conf/develop_theme.cfg, and then run::
        
            $ python2.6 bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
            $ bin/instance fg
            $ parts/nginx/sbin/nginx -c ../../etc/nginx.conf
        
        The unthemed site is at http://localhost:8080. Go there and add a Plone site
        with the id 'plone.org'.  The themed site is at http://localhost:5021/.
        
        NOTE: Due to circumstances around testing the PloneOrg module, there 
        are 2 directories with svn info. The source for Products.PloneOrg is in the 
        'src' directory and the rest of the checked out packages are in 'sources'. If 
        you can't find a checkout, double check BOTH directories.
        
        Database
        ~~~~~~~~
        To get the latest databases from plone.org, you just need to run the get_data 
        shell script. It assumes rsync is in your path::
        
            $ ./conf/get_data
        
        (This requires shell access to plone.org.)
