Plone uses subversion to manage its source code repositories.

Access 
The repositories are accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS. HTTP only allows for
read-only access, while HTTPS supports both read-only and commit access.
Read-only access to all repositories is open for everyone. For each repository a
seperate group is used to limit commit access; only members of this group are
able to commit. To implement this this Apache configuration snippets like these
are used:

<Location /svn/archetypes>
    <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
        Require group cn=ArchetypesCommitters,ou=Groups,dc=plone,dc=org
    </LimitExcept>
</Location>

Accounts and groups are controlled via a standard Apache configuration using the
LDAP database. For more information on the LDAP system please see the account
database information.

Repository browsing

Besides access via subversion tools there are three way for users to browse
through the repositories using a web browser:

* directly browsing the raw repository
* Using the trac interface

Hooks

Some repositories use hooks to perform special actions after a commit. The
common hooks are:

* CIA notification
* trac hook to update issues using commit messages (standard trac script)
* mail script to post commited changes to a list (standard mailer script from SVN)
