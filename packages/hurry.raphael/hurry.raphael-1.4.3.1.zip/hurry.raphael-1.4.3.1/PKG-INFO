        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages Raphael_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware of Raphael's
        structure and different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        .. _Raphael: http://raphaeljs.com/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import Raphael from ``hurry.raphael`` and ``.need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
        from hurry import raphael
        
        .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
        raphael.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``hurry.resource``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``raphael-build``
        directory in ``hurry.raphael``) are published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you depend
        on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above example
        should work out of the box. Make sure to depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_
        package in your ``setup.py``.
        For grok, depending on `megrok.resource`_ should do it
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        .. _`megrok.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/megrok.resource
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.raphael before release
        ======================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.raphael``.
        
        When releasing ``hurry.raphael``, an extra step should be taken. Follow the
        regular package `release instructions`_, but before egg generation (``python
        setup.py register sdist upload``) first execute ``bin/raphaelprepare``. This
        will download the Raphael library and place it in the egg.  (The version number
        is currently hardcoded in the hurry.raphael.prepare module).
