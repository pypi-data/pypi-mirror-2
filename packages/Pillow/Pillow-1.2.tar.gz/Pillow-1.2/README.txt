Pillow
======

Pillow is a "friendly" fork of the Python Imaging Library. The goal is to see
if any improvement can be made to the packaging situation(*) by opening up
development to the "public" and exploring the problem within the fork.

Please email: aclark@aclark.net if you'd like to help, or complain.

(*) PIL aims to support the 'import Image' statement which will fail whenever
there is another 'Image' module in the top level namespace.
