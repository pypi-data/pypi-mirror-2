0.6 (2011-08-21)
----------------

- Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
  with future 1.2 release).

0.5 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
  module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12

0.4 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
  ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
  application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.

0.3 (2011-08-15)
----------------

- Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
  circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).

- Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.

- Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
  "1.1.1dev".

- Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
  ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.

- Fix memory leak.

- HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.

- Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.

0.2 (2011-08-07)
----------------

- Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
  panel next to each query shown in the page).

- Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).

- Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.

0.1 (2011-07-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
