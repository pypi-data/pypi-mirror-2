Remote Folder is a new type, extended from ATFolder, that automatically creates and updates content as Plone types, from remote sources through RSS Feeds.

When you create a Remote folder you provide one or more RSS feed URI and data will be extracted from those feed into new Plone objects such as Pages (Document type) and Images.
