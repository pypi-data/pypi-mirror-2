Description: python-premailer
        ================
        
        python-premailer converts HTML with style tags into HTML with inline style attributes; gmail won't render nice without it!
        
        I made it so I could send colorized git diffs of func-inventory around...
        
        
        Use:
        
        $ sudo pip install python-premailer
        
        $ python
        
        >>> from pypremailer import Premailer
        >>> head = '<html><head><style>foo {size:10px;}</style></head>'
        >>> body = '<body><span class="foo">bar</span></html>'
        >>> html = '%s%s' % ( head, body )
        >>> p = Premailer(html)
        >>> p.premail()
        <html><head></head><body><span style="size: 10px">bar</span></body></html>

        Excuses, excuses
        ----------------
        This definitely already exists in pypi under the name 'premailer', but I wanted to reimplement it without the use of lxml.

        Another package called pyinliner might do the job for you as well:
