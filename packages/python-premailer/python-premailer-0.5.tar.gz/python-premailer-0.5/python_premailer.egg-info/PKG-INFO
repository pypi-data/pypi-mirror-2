Description: python-premailer
        ================
        
        python-premailer converts HTML with style tags into HTML with inline style attributes; gmail won't render nice without it!
        
        I made it so I could send colorized git diffs of func-inventory around...
        
        Use:
        html = sys.stdin.read()
        premailer = Premailer(html)
        inlined_html = premailer.premail()
        print inlined_html
        
        
        Excuses, excuses
        ----------------
        This definitely already exists in pypi under the name 'premailer', but I wanted to reimplement it without the use of lxml.
