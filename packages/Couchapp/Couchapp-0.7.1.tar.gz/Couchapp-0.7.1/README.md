# CouchApp: Standalone CouchDB Application Development Made Simple

CouchApp is designed to structure standalone CouchDB application development for maximum application portability.

CouchApp is a set of scripts and a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin designed  to bring clarity and order to the freedom of [CouchDB](http://couchdb.org)'s document-based approach.

### Write apps using just JavaScript and HTML

Render HTML documents using JavaScript templates run by CouchDB. You'll get parallelism and cacheability, **using only HTML and JS.** Building standalone CouchDB applications according to correct principles affords you options not found on other platforms.

### Deploy your apps to the client

CouchDB's replication means that programs running locally, can still be social. Applications control replication data-flows, so publishing messages and subscribing to other people is easy. Your users will see the benefits of the web without the hassle of requiring always-on connectivity.
