        PBKDF - Password based Key Derivation functions from PKCS#5
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        Password based key derivation functions (PBKDF1, PBKDF2) as defined in section 5 of PKCS#5
        
        A key derivation function produces a derived key from a base key and other parameters.
        In a password-based key derivation function, the base key is a password and the other
        parameters are a salt value and an iteration count.
        
        For verification are included the test vectors from RFC 3962 Appendix B
