        pypiserver is a minimal PyPI compatible server. It can be used to
        serve a set of packages and eggs to easy_install or pip.
        
        Installation and Usage/Quickstart
        =================================
        pypiserver will work with python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7. It will *not* work
        with python versions >= 3 or < 2.5.
        
        Run the following commands to get your PyPI server up and running::
        
          pip install pypiserver
          mkdir ~/packages
          # copy some source packages or eggs to this directory
          pypi-server -p 8080 ~/packages
          pip install -i http://localhost:8080/simple/ ...
        
        
        Detailed Usage
        =================================
        pypi-server -h will print a detailed usage message::
        
          pypi-server [OPTIONS] [PACKAGES_DIRECTORY]
            start PyPI compatible package server serving packages from
            PACKAGES_DIRECTORY. If PACKAGES_DIRECTORY is not given on the
            command line, it uses the default ~/packages.
        
          pypi-server understands the following options:
        
            -p PORT, --port PORT
              listen on port PORT (default: 8080)
        
            -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
              listen on interface INTERFACE (default: 0.0.0.0, any interface)
        
            -r PACKAGES_DIRECTORY, --root PACKAGES_DIRECTORY
              [deprecated] serve packages from PACKAGES_DIRECTORY
        
            --server METHOD
              use METHOD to run the server. Valid values include paste,
              cherrypy, twisted, gunicorn, gevent, wsgiref, auto. The
              default is to use "auto" which chooses one of paste, cherrypy,
              twisted or wsgiref.
        
          pypi-server -h
          pypi-server --help
            show this help message
        
          pypi-server --version
            show pypi-server's version

        Optional dependencies
        =====================
        - pypiserver ships with it's own copy of bottle. It's possible to use
          bottle with different wsgi servers. pypiserver chooses any of the
          following paste, cherrypy, twisted, wsgiref (part of python) if
          available.
        
        
        Bugs
        =============
        pypiserver does not implement the full API as seen on PyPI_. It
        implements just enough to make easy_install and pip install work.
        
        The following limitations are known:
        
        - pypiserver doesn't support uploading files. One might also consider
          that a feature. scp provides a nice workaround.
        - pypiserver doesn't implement the XMLRPC interface: pip search
          will not work.
        - pypiserver doesn't implement the json based '/pypi' interface. pyg_
          uses that and will not work.
