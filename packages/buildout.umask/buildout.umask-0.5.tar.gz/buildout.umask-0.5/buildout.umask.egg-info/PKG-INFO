Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This extension allows better control over the initial permissions of
        files created by buildout by allowing the umask used by the buildout
        script to be specified in the configuration file.
        
        Because of bug 180705 of zc.buildout, this doesn't work for scripts
        installed by buildout.
        
        This doesn't affect the umask of other scripts in the buildout, unless
        they set their own the umask of the user running them will be used,
        e.g.: ZEO/Zope might still make var/filestore/Datafile.fs world
        readable if your umask is 022.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        [buildout]
        extensions = buildout.umask
        umask = 027
        
        The `umask` parameter can be specified using any of Python conventions
        for numeric literals of binary, octal, decimal or hexadecimal
        radix. If any of them is used and a `0` is the first digit, octal is
        assumed as well.
        
        Questions
        =========
        
        The code is quite simple, take a glimpse.
