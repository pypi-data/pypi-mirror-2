Changes
=======

0.5.3
-----

2011-07-11
~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for ``cmd.out`` and ``cmd.err`` functions on the ``cmd`` object

0.5.2
-----

2011-04-24
~~~~~~~~~~

* Added support for extra information in command-specific help, not shown 
  on the command index page
* Added a ``bag`` argument and default alias look up on ``self`` so that  
  commands behave a bit like Marbles
* Added ``instance``, ``raw_args`` and ``raw_opts`` to the ``cmd`` object
  passed to ``run()`` and deprecated the use of ``on_initial_convert()``
* Moved the ``bag`` argument out of ``run()`` and instead it gets passed
  as a service by PipeStack if needed. Can be accessed as ``cmd.service``
  in your ``run()`` function.
* Changed the command structure to be that of a list of tuples, rather than a
  dictionary; nesting now happens by placing a list of tuples as a value
