        Changes
        =======
        
        0.5.3
        -----
        
        2011-07-11
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Support for ``cmd.out`` and ``cmd.err`` functions on the ``cmd`` object
        
        0.5.2
        -----
        
        2011-04-24
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added support for extra information in command-specific help, not shown 
          on the command index page
        * Added a ``bag`` argument and default alias look up on ``self`` so that  
          commands behave a bit like Marbles
        * Added ``instance``, ``raw_args`` and ``raw_opts`` to the ``cmd`` object
          passed to ``run()`` and deprecated the use of ``on_initial_convert()``
        * Moved the ``bag`` argument out of ``run()`` and instead it gets passed
          as a service by PipeStack if needed. Can be accessed as ``cmd.service``
          in your ``run()`` function.
        * Changed the command structure to be that of a list of tuples, rather than a
          dictionary; nesting now happens by placing a list of tuples as a value
        
        0.5.1
        -----
        
        2011-04-04
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added ``requires.txt``
        * Added a new ``run()`` method allowing you to use a ``cmd`` object for
          chaining sub commands
        
        0.5.0
        -----
        
        * Basic support for nested commands, further refactoring of the new use cases
          may be forthcoming
        
        0.4.1
        -----
        
        2010-09-16
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added support for aliases to commands
        
        2010-09-05
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Changed terminology from sub-command to command (internally variables
          are still called ``sub_command`` though)
        * Added a ``help_option``
        * Fixed bad default help desciptions
        
        0.4.0
        -----
