         Datarray: Numpy arrays with named axes
        ========================================
        
        Datarray provides a subclass of Numpy ndarrays that support:
        
        - individual dimensions (axes) being labeled with meaningful descriptions
        - labeled 'ticks' along each axis
        - indexing and slicing by named axis
        - indexing on any axis with the tick labels instead of only integers
        - reduction operations (like .sum, .mean, etc) support named axis arguments
          instead of only integer indices.

        Note
        ====
        
        this code is currently experimental!  It is meant to be a place for the
        community to understand and develop the right semantics and have a prototype
        implementation that will ultimately (hopefully) be folded back into Numpy
        itself.
