1. Change to directly search sites so we don't have to know how to search a site
   before a search for that site can be added.
    - Possibly include an option for pasting the URL from searching for a token
      like "[SEARCHME]" to figure how to search a site for the user. But also
      allow for control over what form elements are included in the search.
2. Add KSS callback for optional logging?
   - This might be better to leave to individuals running their own site who
     have to set up a method for logging out-bound links anyway.
