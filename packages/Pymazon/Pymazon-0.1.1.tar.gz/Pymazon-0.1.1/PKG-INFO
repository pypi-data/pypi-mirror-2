Description: Pymazon is a Python implemented alternative to the Amazon mp3 downloader.
        It allows you to download legally purchased mp3's from the Amazon mp3 store
        using the .amz file provided by Amazon after the purchase. Pymazon can be
        used as both a command line client or a gui (if PyQt4 is installed). The
        only hard external dependency is PyCrypto, which is available in the
        Ubuntu (and likely other distro's) repositories (python-crypto),
        and the cheese shop.
