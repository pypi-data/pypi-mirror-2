        Introduction
        -------------
        
        *mfabrik.plonezohointegration* provide tools to integrate Plone CMS with `Zoho <http://www.zoho.com>`_
        web applications and their data.
        
        The main feature of this add-on product is a new contact form, available as standalone and a portlet,
        which will directly deliver contacts to Zoho CRM where your sales representatives can pick them
        up and handle according to their workflow.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Control panel to set Zoho username, password and API key required for integration communication
        
        * Contact form integration with Zoho CRM. All contacts are automatically converted to Zoho leads.
        The sales person of your organization can screen contact submissions in Zoho CRM
        and dial/email to persons interested in your products.
        
        The features are done using `mfabrik.zoho library for Python <http://github.com/miohtama/mfabrik.zoho>`_.
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        Add the following to your buildout.cfg::
        
        eggs =
        ...
        mfabrik.plonezohointegration
        
        Rerun buildout.
        
        Restart Plone.
        
        Go to Plone Site Setup.
        
        Run add-on installer for *Zoho CRM integration*.
        
        Add your Zoho credentials in *Zoho settings* under *Site Setup*.
        
        .. note::
        
        As the writing of this, plone.app.z3cform trunk version (0.5.0+)
        is needed to make this add-on fully functional.
        
        Plone 3 and beta components
        ============================
        
        This add-on product uses software components which are not yet officially deployed
        for Plone 3 (and maybe never will) like plone.app.registry. To make these components
        work correctly you probably need to use "good-py version pindowns" in your
        buildout.cfg.
        
        For more information, see
        
        * http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/pre-requisites/buildout-configuration
        
        Contact Us portlets and forms
        ==============================
        
        Contact Us form will be available in URL http://yoursite.com/@@zoho-contact-form
        
        The form is also available as a portlet *Zoho Contact Form*. We suggest
        that you add this portlet as a content-type portlet on all of your
        *Pages* and *Folders*.
        
        You can add some fixed field values to all leads generated through the web site
        in Zoho settings.
        
        Portlet CSS
        ===========
        
        You might want add the following to your site theming to hide form fields descriptions
        on the portlet form::
        
        .portletZohoCRMContact .formHelp {
        display: none;
        }
        
        Migration instructions from older versions
        ==========================================
        
        Rerun add-on installer. Before neither control panel nor contact form works.
        
        If you cannot access site setup link then go to Zope Management Interface and portal_quickinstaller.

        --------
        
        More dynamic fields will be included - e.g. how to push URL, browser, language, etc.
