        =============
        
        This project allows you to use py.test as a django test runner, instead of the
        default test runner.
        
        To use it, add it to your python path and add *django_pytest* to your installed
        apps. Also set the *TEST_RUNNER = 'django_pytest.test_runner.run_tests'* setting.
        
        Also create a conftest.py in your project directory and include:
        from pytest.conftest import pytest_funcarg__client, pytest_funcarg__django_client
        
        Now anywhere in your project, you can create files called
        *test_<something>.py*.  These are standard py.test test files. Use the funcarg
        *client* in every test to both instantiate a test database that is cleared
        after each test and to provide you with a django test client object identical
        to the one used in django's test system. For example:
        
        def test_filter(client):
            response = client.get('/browse/', {'filter': '1'})
            assert response.status_code == 200
        
        Use *./manage.py test* to run the py.test test runs (ie: it replaces the
        standard django test runner). You can pass py.test options to the command
        and they will be forwarded to py.test. (Technically, I haven't got it passing
        all options, just the most common ones I use)
        
        The management command has been set up so that syncdb will use the django core
        syncdb, even if south is installed. This prevents migrations from running when
        running unit tests.
        
        This project differs from http://github.com/bfirsh/pytest_django in that it
        provides a django test runner that calls py.test, rather than creating a
        py.test plugin to test django projects. I believe there is overlapping
        functionality from the two projects, and also that they can be integrated into
        a single project, but I have not looked at the feasibility of this yet.
