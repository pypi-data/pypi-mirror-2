Runners for the individual tasks
================================

The runner module provides three methods (which are registered as
console_scripts) that call the app loop with custom parameters:

>>> import gocept.lms.runner
>>> gocept.lms.runner.checker
<function checker at 0x...>
>>> gocept.lms.runner.notifier
<function notifier at 0x...>
>>> gocept.lms.runner.scheduler
<function scheduler at 0x...>
