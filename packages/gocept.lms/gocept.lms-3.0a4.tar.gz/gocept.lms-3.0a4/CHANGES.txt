Changes
=======

3.0a4 (2011-01-25)
++++++++++++++++++

- Make registration and sync of URLs resilient towards malformed URLs. We now
  require URLs to be ASCII only. Please make your client encode the URL before
  sending it to us.

- Increased debug output for client notification *a lot*. We show all URLs
  that the client gets notified about now.

- Mark URLs that do not have handlers associated or are forbidden by the
  policy as checked so they will only reappar after the same period a
  successful check would.

3.0a3 (2011-01-18)
++++++++++++++++++

- Provide a minimal UI for inspecting the URL database and allow purging
  selected URLs from the database.

- Fix problem in conflict resolution: if an object relied on the default
  of a class then the state dict doesn't contain that value.

- Improved error handling for URLs which have an empty string (or bad statust
  line) as response.

- Remove dependency on twisted.

- Provide a separate state (recommended color: blue) for URLs that the LMS can
  not or refuses to check.

- Don't classify mailto links (optimization).

3.0a2 (2009-05-21)
++++++++++++++++++

- Updated documentation a bit.

- Declared namespace package.

- Updated used egg versions.

- Added missing dependency to pytz.

3.0a1 (2009-04-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- first public release.
