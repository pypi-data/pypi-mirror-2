``repoze.who`` -- WSGI Authentication Middleware / API
======================================================

Overview
--------

``repoze.who`` is an identification and authentication framework
for arbitrary WSGI applications.  ``repoze.who`` can be configured
either as WSGI middleware or as an API for use by an application.

The plugins in this package were originally distributed with ``repoze.who``,
but are now deprecated, and released separately to discourage their
use in non-legacy deployments.
