Birdland Overview
=================


Birdland is a simple and focused blogging application for use in
Django_ projects. It is designed to be simple to set up and to
play well with others.


Installation
============

Birdland depends upon a working installation of Django_ 1.0 or newer.

To install Birdland system-wide, use the included script named 
"setup.py" by running::

    $ python setup.py install

Note that system administrative privileges may be required. For
further installation options run::

    $ python setup.py install --help


Optional Dependencies
=====================

Birdland has optional tagging and markup capabilities that require
some third party libraries.

In order to use the tagging features a working installation of
django-tagging_ must be present.

To make use of the advanced markup processing capabilities of
Birdland the libraries of interest must be installed and working.
Birdland natively supports Textile_ through `Python Textile`_,
`reStructured Text`_ through docutils_, and Markdown_ through
markdown2_ or `markdown.py`_.
