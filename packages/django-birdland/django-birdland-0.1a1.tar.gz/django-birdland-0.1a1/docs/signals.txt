Birdland Signals
================

Birdland defines and sends the following custom signals for users to hook into
the markup processing behavior during the saving of an ``Entry``. These signals
are defined in the ``birdland.signals`` module.

``entry_markup_preprocess``
===========================

Sent before the raw markup fields are processed during ``Entry`` save.

Arguments sent:

    ``sender``
        the ``Entry`` instance

``entry_markup_processed``
==========================

Sent after the raw markup fields are processed and the ``*_html`` fields have
been populated. Useful for applying fixups to the rendered markup, such as
typographical tweaks.

Arguments sent:

    ``sender``
        the ``Entry`` instance
