zope.testrunner Changelog
*************************

4.0.0b3 (2010-06-16)
====================

- LP #221151: keep ``unittest.TestCase.shortDescription`` happy by supplying
  a ``_testMethodDoc`` attribute.

- LP #595052: keep the distribution installable under Python 2.4:  its
  distutils appears to munge the empty ``__init__.py`` file in the
  ``foo.bar`` egg used for testing into a directory.

- LP #580083: fix the ``bin/test`` script to run only tests from
  ``zope.testrunner``.

- LP #579019: When layers were run in parallel, their tearDown was
  not called. Additionally, the first layer which was run in the main
  thread did not have it's tearDown called either.


4.0.0b2 (2010-05-03)
====================

- Having 'sampletests' in the MANIFEST.in gave warnings, but doesn't actually
  seem to include any more files, so I removed it.

- Moved zope.testing.exceptions to zope.testrunner.exceptions. Now
  zope.testrunner no longer requires zope.testing except for when running
  its own tests.


4.0.0b1 (2010-04-29)
====================

- Initial release of the testrunner from zope.testrunner as it's own module.
