zope.testrunner Changelog
*************************

4.0.0b2 (2010-05-03)
====================

- Having 'sampletests' in the MANIFEST.in gave warnings, but doesn't actually
  seem to include any more files, so I removed it.
  
- Moved zope.testing.exceptions to zope.testrunner.exceptions. Now
  zope.testrunner no longer requires zope.testing except for when running 
  its own tests.
  

4.0.0b1 (2010-04-29)
====================

- Initial release of the testrunner from zope.testrunner as it's own module.
