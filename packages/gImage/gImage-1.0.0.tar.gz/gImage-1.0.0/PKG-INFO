        This is a simple python module mostly meant to be used on the command line. It's really simple, you pass it a search query, it queries google, and returns the first image it gets back. It's pretty damn addictive.
          
        To use it on the command line, type: ``python -m gimage sarah silverman``
        To use it in your project::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from gimage import get_image_url
        
            print get_image_url("sarah silverman")
