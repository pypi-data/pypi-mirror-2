mark3
=====

mark3 provides a lightweight, markdown_ to html parser for python 2.7 and 3.

.. _markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

Usage
-----

Using mark3 is very simple::

    from mark3.markdown import markdown
    html = markdown(raw_text)

Deviations
----------

mark3 may differ slightly from the official markdown implementation.

Lists
+++++

A <p> will be placed in an <li> if, and *only if* it's needed::
    
    * foo
    * bar

Will produce the same output as::

    * foo

    * bar


Inline HTML
+++++++++++

This markdown::

    < foo <b>bar</b>>

Produces::

    <p>&lt; foo <b>bar</b>&gt;</p>

Instead of the official markdown implementation output::

    <p>&lt; foo <b>bar</b>></p>


Tabs
++++

Tabs are expanded to 4 spaces before parsing. As such, output will never contain
tabs.


Insignificant Whitespace
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Outputted html doesn't have as much whitespace as the official markdown
implementation.
