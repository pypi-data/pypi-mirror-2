Version 0.1:

    - initial release, derived from "Traffic mechanism" in TextTest 3.20
    - for changes compared to that version, see ChangeLog in TextTest 3.21 release

Version 0.11

    - Fix to make it work with test discovery, e.g. nosetests (thanks Kumar McMillan)

Version 0.2

Enhancements:

    - Added possibility to write a custom client, reusing the CaptureMock server. See website.

Bugfixes:

    - TCP backlog for server greatly increased to avoid trouble on overloaded networks
    - Command line now recreates rather than appending to any existing mock files
    - Now handle the situation where getattr creates new objects instead of just returning the same one
	for example when using xmlrpc
    - Don't cause __nonzero__ methods to be called unnecessarily on intercepted objects
    - Fixed bug which caused import problems when recording in some obscure situations
    - "check_repeated_calls" now also works with "partial interception", previously only worked when intercepting entire modules
