shibazuke --- Fast object serializer for Python
===============================================

shibazuke provides simple and fast object serialization. 
Usually shibazuke generates smaller data than picke or JSON,
and faster on both serialization and de-serialization. 

shibazuke is intended to be safely used for 
interprocess-communications, so hopefully de-serializing
maliciously crafted data doesn't harm.


Installing
==========

run "python setup.py install".
