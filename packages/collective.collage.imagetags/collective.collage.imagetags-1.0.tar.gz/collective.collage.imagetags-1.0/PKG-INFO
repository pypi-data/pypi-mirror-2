Description: Introduction
        ============
        Adds a "Image tags" layout view in Collage to display object images 
        tagged with collective.imagetags.
        
        Layouts are registered only for objects providing the following interfaces:
        
        * Products.ATContentTypes.interfaces.IATImage
        * Products.ATContentTypes.interfaces.IATNewsItem
        
        A special "Settings" viewlet is added in the Collage viewlet manager to
        set the scale to use to show the tagged image.
        
        Extending
        =========
        To provide this layout to your custom content types just copy the 
        code below (as stated in browser/configure.zcml)::
        
            <browser:page
                name="tags"
                for="<your_interface_here>"
                permission="zope.Public"
                class="collective.collage.imagetags.browser.views.ImageTagsView"
                layer="Products.Collage.interfaces.ICollageBrowserLayer"
                />
        
        If you want to use a special template, add a template "attribute". 
        If not, a default template will be used from browser.views.ImageTagsView.
        
        Features
        ========
        - i18n support (English and Spanish translations)
        - Tested in Plone 4.0b5 with Collage 1.3.0_b4
        - Settings viewlet displays an inline z3c.form to set preferences for the layout
        - Depends on Product.Collage and collective.imagetags. They will automatically fetch during buildout and installed during installation of this product.
        
        To do
        =====
        - collective.collage.imagetags.scales vocabulary should dynamically calculate image scales of every image field in its context.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add ``collective.collage.imagetags`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.collage.imagetags
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.collage.imagetags
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
        the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
