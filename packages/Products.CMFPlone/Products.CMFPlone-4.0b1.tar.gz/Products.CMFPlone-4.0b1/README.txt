About Products.CMFPlone
=======================

Plone 4.1 will separate the Products.CMFPlone package from the Plone egg to
give integrators the option of building Plone sites with a cut down feature
set.

Version 4.0 of this package is a forward compatibility shim (an empty egg
depending on the `Plone package`_) to enable Plone extension packages
depending on `Products.CMFPlone` to work with Plone 4.0 or 3.3.

Version 4.1 of this package (when it is released) will contain the
`Products.CMFPlone` code.
