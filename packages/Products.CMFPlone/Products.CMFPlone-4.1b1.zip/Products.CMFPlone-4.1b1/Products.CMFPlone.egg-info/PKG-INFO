        Technical overview
        ------------------
        
        Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top
        of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development
        system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop
        new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is
        covered in the `documentation`_.
        
        Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported
        Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to
        Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone
        work.
        
        By default, Plone stores its contents in Zope's built in transactional object
        database, the ZODB. There are products and techniques, however, to share
        information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
        files, etc.
        
        Plone runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and many other platforms;
        double-click installers are available for Windows and Mac OS X, and RPM
        packages are available for Linux. For full information, see the
        `plone.org product page`_.

          [elro]
        
        - Depend on plone.app.uuid for indexing content UUIDs.
          [toutpt, davisagli]
        
        - Added ++resource++blank.html, a building block for cross-domain iframe

          Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket10809
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Merge in PLIP #10901: Set and enforce base coding standards for our own
          JavaScript. Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10901
          [esteele]
        
        - Removed IOrderedContainer-implementation from PloneFolder in favour

        - Renamed package to `Products.CMFPlone`.
          [elro]
        
        - Deprecated the following scripts that are only used by deprecated templates.
          These will be removed in Plone 5: prefs_group_edit.py,
          prefs_valid_search_restriction.py, prefs_user_group_search.py,
          prefs_portrait_delete.py.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Replaced the prefs_group_details.pt template with a browser view in
          plone.app.controlpanel. Ss a side effect this means group creation is now
          protected by the Plone Users and Groups control panel permission, rather than
          the CMF Manage Groups permission.
          [davisagli]

          "Manage portal".
          [davisagli]
        
        - Configure the Site Administrator role in the default rolemap and workflows.
          This role is intended for people who should have full content editing
          privileges but not Manager access (i.e. to the ZMI).
          [davisagli]
        
        - Updated to use Zope 2.13.
