0.3 (2011-06-30)
================

- Fixed PostgreSQL ProgrammingError when query string contains a backslash
  character.  (LP #798725)

- Added ability to mark content with arbitrary markers which can be used as 
  discriminators at query time.  (LP #792334)

- Support searches for words containing an apostrophe.  (LP #801265)


0.2 (2011-06-15)
================

- Reworked the scoring method: added a per-document score coefficient.
  The score coefficient can boost the score of documents known to be
  trustworthy.

- Added the IWeightedText interface.  The discriminator function can
  return an IWeightedText instance to control the weights and
  coefficient.

- Added the IWeightedQuery interface.  Text index queries can
  pass an IWeightedQuery instance to control the weight values.

- Allow persistent objects to be indexed, since the usual objection
  (accidental ZODB references) does not apply.

- Do not drop and create the table by default, making PGTextIndex
  easier to use outside ZODB.

- Added the 'get_contextual_summaries' and 'get_contextual_summary'
  methods to the index.

- Compatability with repoze.catalog 0.8.0.


0.1 (2011-01-20)
================

- Initial release.
