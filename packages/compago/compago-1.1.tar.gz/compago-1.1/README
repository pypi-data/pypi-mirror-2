Write polished command line applications in a fraction of the time.
Guaranteed, or double your money back!

Compago is a framework for simple command-line parsing in Python. Compago
provides a simple framework and set of decorators to allow you to quickly
and easily define a set of commands within a script. For those familiar with
Ruby's Thor, Compago fills a similar niche.

This project was inspired by the excellent Flask-Script extension for Flask,
but has been entirely rewritten to remove all Flask dependencies.

(see: http://packages.python.org/Flask-Script/)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Start
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, install compago with pip, or alternately fetch the sources from Github or PyPI.

  $ pip install compago

Then, create a python file named "mycommand.py" containing this:

  import compago

  app = compago.Application()

  @app.command
  def say_hello(to="world"):
    print("Hello there, %s" % to)

  if __name__ == '__main__': app.run()

Save the file, and run it thusly:

  $ python mycommand.py

For some more in-depth examples, see the /examples folder in the sources.

Background
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Compago?

We've all needed to whip up a quick command line script at some point. How
often have you wanted to wrap a quick five lines of Python in a script for
reuse? Perhaps your little script requires a few arguments to be passed in.
In the past, you've had a few options:

  - Quick and dirty: just hard code some global variables at the top of
    your script.
  - Better, but still messy: just directly pull in sys.argv
  - Best, but difficult: use optparse or argparse

If you'll be using the script often, option 1 can become a pain very quickly.
And if you ever need to let someone else use the script, option 1 can be a
no-go.

Option 2 is pretty easy, but just directly using sys.argv can get out
of control very quickly if you need to pull in more than one command line
argument.

Using argparse or optparse is the most prudent option, but if your script
is just a few lines of code, setting up all of that boilerplate can add
a ton of overhead to your quick script.

With Compago, you have another option. With the use of some simple
decorators, Compago can introspect a function, and set up command line
arguments and defaults automagically.

For example, instead of importing optparse, and manually setting up each
option in an OptionParser, and then taking the output of that and feeding
it into your function, you can just define your function thusly:

  @app.command
  def check_host(hostname, username='admin', password='testing123'):
      '''Do some stuff.'''
      pass

Now, the function's arguments (hostname, username, password) will be
available as command line arguments to your script:

  ./app check_host localhost --username=root --password=testing234

That's it! No other nasty boilerplate required.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Compago
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use pip or easy_install:

  pip install compago
  easy_install compago

Boom. Done.

Or alternately, fetch the source from github:

  git clone https://github.com/jmohr/erigo.git

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Compago
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A basic script will be structured in the following way:

  import compago

  myapp = compago.Application()

  @myapp.command
  def mycommand(arg):
    print "running mycommand with arg: %s" % arg

  if __name__ == '__main__': myapp.run()

Then, if that script is saved as "myapp.py", you can execute your new script
from the command line like this:

  python myapp.py -h
  python myapp.py mycommand -h
  python myapp.py mycommand "Hello, world!"

That's all there is to writing a basic Compago script.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands and Options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The @app.command decorator shown above is pretty straight forward in its
usage. Simply decorate a function (with or without arguments), and the
function will then be available as a "command" on the command line.

Function arguments without a default defined will be "positional" or
"required" arguments on the command line. For example, in the mycommand
example above, the "arg" argument is required on the command line.

If you provide a default for your function argument, it will be an option
on the command line. For example:

  @myapp.command
  def mycommand(say="Hello", name="John Doe"):
    print "%s, %s." % (say, name)

In that example, the arguments "say" and "name" will be available as options
on the command line:

  python myapp.py --say="What up" --name="Justin Beiber"
  or
  python myapp.py -s "Goodbye" -n "Dude"

If the options are not specified, the defaults will be used. One special
type of option exists, and that is a boolean option:

  @myapp.command
  def mycommand(debug=False):
    if debug:
      print "Lots of great debugging info..."
    else:
      print "Terse. Very terse."

In this example, the "debug" option is a switch on the command line:

  python myapp.py --debug

If provided, debug will be set to True. No need to provide a value.

You can mix up the argument types, as well:

  @myapp.command
  def deploy(hostname, username="admin", verbose=True):
    result = ssh_to(hostname, username=username)
    if verbose: print result

It works as you'd expect.

Another decorator is available if you need more control over the options.
You can define one or more @option decorators on your function, and pass
in the same arguments that you would pass directly to argparse.ArgumentParser
to define an option. See it in action:

  @myapp.option('-x', '--execute', dest='command')
  @myapp.option('-U', '--user', dest='username')
  def run(command, username):
    with exec_user(username):
      call(command)

This also works about as you'd expect. One thing to note, if you decorate
your function with one or more @option decorators, there is no need to also
decorate it with @command. This will be done automatically.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Helper functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compago also defines a few helper functions for you to use in your scripts.
These helpers are in the compago.script module:

ask(question, default) - Prompt the user and return their answer.
password(question) - Prompt the user for a password.
yesno(question, default) - Prompt the user with a y/n question.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lots of things...
