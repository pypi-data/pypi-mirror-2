Description: django-beta
        ===========
        
        ``django-beta`` is a simple application to help you capture pre-beta interest
        with your sites.
        
        By default ``django-beta`` only captures a user's email address, however you
        can alternately set one of these two configuration options:
        
        BETA_CAPTURE_FIRST = True, will use a form and require the user to enter their
        first name and email address.
        
        BETA_CAPTURE_BOTH = True, will use a form and require the user enter their
        first name, last name, and email address.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``beta`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and run syncdb.
        
        Add the following to your urls.py:
        
        url(r'^beta/', include('beta.urls')),
        
        Using the example templates provided in the code, create your customized beta signup templates.
        
        Managers
        --------
        
        The ``BetaSignup`` model has the following manager method to help out:
        
        BetaSignup.objects.contacted()
        BetaSignup.objects.not_contacted()
        BetaSignup.objects.registered()
        BetaSignup.objects.not_registered()
        
        Side Effects
        ------------
        
        ``django-beta`` listens for a signal on User creation and marks the
        corresponding BetaSignup entry as 'registered'.
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * Admin views to show beta registrations over time
        * Management commands to simplify emailing the interested users
