Pendrell:  A Twisted HTTP/1.1 User Agent for the Programmatic Web
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Pendrell augments the twisted.web framework with an HTTP 1client that has
several advantages over prior art (or at least urllib2 and twisted.web.client):

  * HTTP 1.1 support:
    * TE/transfer-encoding support for chunked, gzip, and deflate encodings
    * Ability to simultaneously maintain multiple persistent connections.
  * Transparent Gzip and Deflate Content-encoding support.
  * Ability to stream data, by performing call-backs with data chunks,
    alleviates the need to buffer large files.
    * Advanced Gzip support accomdates incremental decoding of chunked streams.
  * Asynchronous (twisted) API.
  * Integration with cookielib, and compatibility with urllib2.Request API.
  * Proxy Support.


Changelog
---------

Version 0.3.0
  * Allow multiple Authenticators to be installed into Agent.authenticators.
  * Modify errors.UnauthorizedResponse to handle multiple WWW-Authenticate
    header values.
