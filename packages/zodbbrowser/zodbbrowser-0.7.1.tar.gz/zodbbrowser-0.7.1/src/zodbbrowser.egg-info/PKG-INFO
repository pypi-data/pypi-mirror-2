Description: ZODB Browser
        ============
        
        The ZODB browser allows you to inspect persistent objects stored in the ZODB,
        view their attributes and historical changes made to them.
        
        
        Usage as a standalone project
        -----------------------------
        
        Install all the dependencies into the source tree with zc.buildout::
        
        python bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout
        
        Run bin/zodbbrowser specifying either a filename or a ZEO address ::
        
        bin/zodbbrowser /path/to/Data.fs
        bin/zodbbrowser --zeo localhost:9080
        bin/zodbbrowser --zeo /path/to/zeosock
        
        If you don't have a spare Data.fs to test with, you can create a new empty
        one with just the barest Zope 3 scaffolding in it::
        
        bin/zodbbrowser empty.fs --rw
        
        Open http://localhost:8070 in a web browser.  Note that there are no
        access controls; all other users on the local machine will be able to
        access the database contents.
        
        Or you could try to use easy_install.  It may work or it may not, depending
        on the current state of all the dependencies (buildout.cfg hardcodes
        dependency version to a known-working-together state, called the "Zope 3.4
        Known Good Set", so buildout-based installs are safer) ::
        
        easy_install zodbbrowser
        zodbbrowser /path/to/Data.fs
        
        
        Command-line options
        --------------------
        
        Run ``bin/zodbbrowser --help`` to see a full and up-to-date list of
        command-line options::
        
        Usage: zodbbrowser [options] [FILENAME | --zeo ADDRESS]
        
        Open a ZODB database and start a web-based browser app.
        
        Options:
        -h, --help        show this help message and exit
        --zeo=ADDRESS     connect to ZEO server instead
        --listen=ADDRESS  specify port (or host:port) to listen on
        --rw              open the database read-write (allows creation of the
        standard Zope local utilities if missing)
        
        
        Online help
        -----------
        
        There's a little 'help' link in the bottom-right corner of every page that
        describes the user interface in greater detail.
        
        
        Usage as a plugin
        -----------------
        
        Add zodbbrowser to the list of eggs (e.g. in buildout.cfg of your app) and
        add this to your site.zcml::
        
        <include package="zodbbrowser" />
        
        Rerun bin/buildout, restart Zope and append @@zodbbrowser to the end of the
        URL to start browsing, e.g. http://localhost:8080/@@zodbbrowser.  Or, if you
        still use ZMI (the Zope Management Interface), look for a new menu item
        titled "ZODB Browser".
        
        
        Alternatives
        ------------
        
        There's a package called z3c.zodbbrowser in the Zope svn repository that
        implements the same idea (but without history browsing) as a GUI desktop
        application written using wxPython.  It doesn't have a website and was never
        released to the Python Package Index.
        
        There's also `dm.historical`__ which provides access to object history from
        an interactive Python shell.

        Changes
        -------
        
        0.7.1 (2010-03-30)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - IMPORTANT BUGFIX: don't leave old object states lying around in ZODB object
        cache, which could lead to DATA LOSS (LP#487243 strikes again, this time
        for OrderedContainers).
        
        I've audited the code and am fairly confident this bug is now dead dead
        dead.
        
        - Try to discard data modifications when the DB is opened read-only.
        
        - Avoid deprecated zope.testing.doctest.
        
        - Avoid zope.app.securitypolicy; use zope.securitypolicy.
        
        
        0.7 (2009-12-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Stopped using setuptools extras; now easy_install zodbbrowser is sufficient
        to run the standalone app.
        
        
        0.6.1 (2009-12-09)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Compatibility with latest Zope packages, including ZODB 3.9.x.
        
        
        0.6 (2009-12-07)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Ability to revert object state to an older version.  Requires a read-write
        database connection (i.e. run bin/zodbbrowser --rw).  The button is hidden
        and appears when you're hovering over a transaction entry in the list.
        - Collapse long item lists by default.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2009-11-23)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - IMPORTANT BUGFIX: don't leave old object states lying around in ZODB object
        cache, which could lead to DATA LOSS (LP#487243).  This affected OOBTree
        objects.
        
        
        0.5 (2009-11-23)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Be a bit more tolerant to unpickling errors (show which revision could not
        be loaded instead of breaking the whole page).
        - Show full history of OOBTree objects and subobjects (LP#474334).
        - Change background color of links on hover, to make it clear what
        object you'll see when you click, especially when the __repr__ shown
        contains reprs of subobjects.
        - Show size of containers next to the "Items" heading (LP#486910).
        - Show size of containers next to their representation, e.g.
        "<persistent.dict.PersistentDict object at 0xad0b3ec> (0 items)".
        - Pay attention when __name__ is declared as a class attribute (LP#484899).
        - Show names of directly provided interfaces on objects (i.e. show a better
        representation of pickled zope.interface.Provides objects).
        - Pretty-printing of dictionaries (including nested ones).
        
        
        0.4 (2009-10-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - @@zodbbrowser oid and tid parameters now accept values in hex format (0x0123)
        Patch by Adam Groszer.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2009-07-17)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed install error on Windows (path cannot end in /).
        
        
        0.3 (2009-07-17)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - First public release
        
Platform: UNKNOWN
