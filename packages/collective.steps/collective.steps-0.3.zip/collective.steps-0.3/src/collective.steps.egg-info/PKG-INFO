Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Stepper is a very good Zope products. This egg is a first effort to bring some
        plone relative steps availables to developpers and site administrator.
        
        How many of you have suffer from having proxy error while trying to reindex
        a new index in a catalog ?
        
        Well now it's possible to:
        - Change all members's passwords to a unique password
        - Change all members's emails to a unique email
        - Apply a profile without busy a zope's current thread on a production server
        - Activate/Deactivate a PAS plugin: deactivate login from your website before activate a migration
        
        So if you have any idea for any reusable migration or feature for developpers, let me know.

        How to use
        ==========
        
        Like Stepper, for example:
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/instance run parts/productdistros/Stepper/run.py -C collective.steps.config /plone profile_default
        
        
        Available steps
        ===============
        
        Password
        --------
        
        This step let you set a common password for all members of Plone site. The base configuration for this step set the passwords to 'secret'
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/instance run parts/productdistros/Stepper/run.py -C collective.steps.config /myplone init_users_password
        
        EMail
        -----
        
        This step let you set a common email to all members of a Plone site. The base configuration for this step set the mail to 'mail@provider.com'
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/instance run parts/productdistros/Stepper/run.py -C collective.steps.config /myplone email
        
        ClearExpiredAccount
        -------------------
        
        In a Plone site when you fullfill the join_form a member is created in the member database with a random password.
        Then the password reset request is sent to the user. This step help you providing a way to cleanup your member database
        
        You can also adding some lines of code to monkey patch the password reset tool to not clean it's own password reset requests. Once the password
        requests are reseted you can't detect if a user account already been activated.
        ::
        
            from Products.PasswordResetTool.PasswordResetTool import PasswordResetTool
            def clearExpired(self, days=10): pass
            PasswordResetTool.clearExpired = clearExpired
            logger.info('password reset tool is now patched, clearExpired do nothing')
        
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/instance run parts/productdistros/Stepper/run.py -C collective.steps.config /myplone del_unactivated_account
        
        Profile
        -------
        
        Apply a generic setup profile.
        ::
        
            $ ./bin/instance run parts/productdistros/Stepper/run.py -C collective.steps.config /myplone profile_default
