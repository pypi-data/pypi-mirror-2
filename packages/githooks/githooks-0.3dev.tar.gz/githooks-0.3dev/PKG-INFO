        ========
        
        githooks is a simple module that adds several python related useful hooks to use
        with Git hooks system.
        
        It uses the hghooks module as backend. It implements part of the Mercurial API
        for hooks, and calls hghooks for the heavy lifting. It supports what hghooks
        module supports, currently:
        
            * pep8 checking of python files
            * pyflakes checking of python files
            * Checking for forgotten pdb statements in python files
            * Trac integration. This includes:
                - Making sure at least a ticket is mentioned in the changeset message
                - Updating the Trac ticket with the changeset
