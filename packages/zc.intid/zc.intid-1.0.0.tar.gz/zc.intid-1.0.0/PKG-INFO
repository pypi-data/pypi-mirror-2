Description: ==============================================
        zc.intid - Reduced-conflict integer id utility
        ==============================================
        
        This package provides an API to create integer ids for any object.
        Objects can later be looked up by their id as well.  This functionality
        is commonly used in situations where dealing with objects is
        undesirable, such as in search indices or any code that needs an easy
        hash of an object.
        
        This is similar to the ``zope.intid`` package, but with two distinct
        advantages:
        
        - Induces fewer conflict errors, since object ids are not used as part
          of the stored data.  The id for an object is stored in an attribute of
          the object itself, with the attribute name being configured by the
          construction of the id utility.
        
          This does require that the object "play nice" with this approach.  At
          a minimum, the attributes used to store ids on objects should
        
          - persist with the rest of the object's state, and
        
          - not be modified by the object.
        
        - Fewer dependencies.
        
        Events generated on the assignment and removal of ids are generated by
        the ``register`` and ``unregister`` methods rather than by the callers
        of those methods.
