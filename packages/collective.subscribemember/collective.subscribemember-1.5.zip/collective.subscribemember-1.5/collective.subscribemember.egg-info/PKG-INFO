        Dependencies
        ============

        * Remember (tested with 1.1b3)
        * Membrane (tested with 1.1b5)

        Installation
        ============
        
        Buildout
        --------
        
        *   The required configuration you need in your buildout can be seen here: http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/collective.subscribemember/trunk/buildout.cfg .
        Just copy this into your existing buildout (or use it as is) and run buildout.
        
        *   Restart Zope.
        
        *   Go to the Site Setup page in the Plone interface and click on the Add/Remove Products
        link. Choose collective.subscribemember (check its checkbox) and click the Install
        button. If collective.subscribemember is not available on the Add/Remove Products
        list, it usually means that the product did not load due to missing prerequisites.
        
        *   From the main Site Setup page, click on Zope Management Interface, portal_properties, then
        subscribemember_properties and enter the available membership subscription options
        in the `membertypes` field. Each subscription option is on a new line and the semicolon
        separated text values are as follows::
        
        > Label for dropdown menu;Subscription amount as an integer,['List of roles paid-up member is granted'],Number of years subscribed as an integer value,Other text description for membership type (optional)
        > E.g. Physician,15,['Member'],1,STUD-2
        
        Following this, you can enter the `member_import_directory` where collective.subscribemember
        should look for a CSV file containing member data to import and also the `reminder_email_trigger`,
        which is the number of days prior to the subscription expiry date that a member should be sent a
        reminder email asking them to renew their subscription.
