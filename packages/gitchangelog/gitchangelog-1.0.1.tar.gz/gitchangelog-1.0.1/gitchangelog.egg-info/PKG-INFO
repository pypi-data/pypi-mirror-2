        git-changelog
        =============
        
        Translate ``git log`` output to a configurable changelog.
        
        Feature
        =======
        
        - ignore commit message based on regexp matching
        - refactor commit message displayed on the fly with replace regexp
        - classify commit message into sections (ie: New, Fix, Changes...)
        - filter out tags by regexps
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        As documentation is really scarse for the moment, please take a look at this
        sample configuration file provided in the github repository
        http://github.com/securactive/gitchangelog/blob/master/gitchangelog.rc.sample
        
        The changelog of gitchangelog is generated with himself and with the sample
        configuration file. Please have a look and enjoy.
