=============
git-changelog
=============

Translate ``git log`` output to a configurable changelog.

Feature
-------

  - ignore commit message based on regexp matching
  - refactor commit message displayed on the fly with replace regexp
  - classify commit message into sections (ie: New, Fix, Changes...)
  - filter out tags by regexps

Usage
-----

As documentation is really scarse for the moment, please take a look at this
sample configuration file provided in the github repository
http://github.com/securactive/gitchangelog/blob/master/gitchangelog.rc.sample

The changelog of gitchangelog is generated with himself and with the sample
configuration file. Please have a look and enjoy.
