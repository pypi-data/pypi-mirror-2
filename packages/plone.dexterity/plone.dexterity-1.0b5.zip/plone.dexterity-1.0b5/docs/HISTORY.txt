  http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=69
  [davisagli]

* For now, no longer ensure that Dexterity content provides ILocation (in
  particular, that it has a __parent__ pointer), since that causes problems
  when exporting in Zope 2.10.
  [davisagli]

* Don't assume the cancel and actions buttons are always present in the
  default forms.
  [optilude]

1.0a3 - 2010-01-08
------------------

* require zope.filerepresentation>=3.6.0 for IRawReadFile
  [csenger]

1.0a2 - 2009-10-12
------------------

* Added support for zope.size.interfaces.ISized. An adapter to this interface
  may be used to specify the file size that is reported in WebDAV operations
  or used for Plone's folder listings. This requires that the sizeForSorting()
  method is implemented to return a tuple ('bytes', numBytes), where numBytes
  is the size in bytes.
  [optilude]

* Added support for WebDAV. This is primarily implemented by adapting content
  objects to the IRawReadFile and IRawWriteFile interfaces from the
  zope.filerepresentation package. The default is to use plone.rfc822 to
  construct an RFC(2)822 style message containing all fields. One or more
  fields may be marked with the IPrimaryField interface from that package,
  in which case they will be sent in the body of the message.
  
  In addition, the creation of new files (PUT requests to a null resource) is
  delegated to an IFileFactory adapter, whilst the creation of new directories
  (MKCOL requests) is delegated to an IDirectoryFactory adapter. See
  zope.filerepresentation for details, and filerepresentation.py for the
  default implementation.
  [optilude]

* Move AddViewActionCompat to the second base class of DexterityFTI, so that
  the FTI interfaces win over IAction. This fixes a problem with GenericSetup
  export: http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=79
  [optilude]

* Add getMapping() to AddViewActionCompat. 
  Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=78

1.0a1 - 2009-07-25
------------------
