2.1.0
=====
:release-date: 2010-10-08 12:00 PM CEST

Important Notes
---------------

This release depends on Celery version 2.1.0.
Be sure to read the Celery changelog before you upgrade:
http://ask.github.com/celery/changelog.html#version-2-1-0

News
----

* The periodic task schedule can now be stored in the database and edited via
  the Django Admin interface.

    To use the new database schedule you need to start ``celerybeat`` with the
    following argument::

        $ python manage.py celerybeat -S djcelery.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler

    Note that you need to add your old periodic tasks to the database manually
    (using the Django admin interface for example).

* New Celery monitor for the Django Admin interface.

    To start monitoring your workers you have to start your workers
    in event mode::

        $ python manage.py celeryd -E

    (you can do this without restarting the server too::

        >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
        >>> broadcast("enable_events")

    You need to do a syncdb to create the new tables:

        python manage.py syncdb

    Then you need to start the snapshot camera::

        $ python manage.py celerycam -f 2.0

    This will take a snapshot of the events every 2 seconds and store it in
    the database.

Fixes
-----

* database backend: Now shows warning if polling results with transaction isolation level
  repeatable-read on MySQL.

    See http://github.com/ask/django-celery/issues/issue/6

* database backend: get result does no longer store the default result to
  database.

    See http://github.com/ask/django-celery/issues/issue/6

2.0.2
=====

Important notes
---------------

* Due to some applications loading the Django models lazily, it is recommended
  that you add the following lines to your ``settings.py``::

       import djcelery
       djcelery.setup_loader()

    This will ensure the Django celery loader is set even though the
    model modules haven't been imported yet.

News
----

* ``djcelery.views.registered_tasks``: Added a view to list currently known
  tasks.

2.0.0
