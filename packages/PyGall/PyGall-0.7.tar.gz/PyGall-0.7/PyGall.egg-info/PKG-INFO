        About PyGall
        ------------
        
        PyGall is a simple web photo gallery written in Python and built on the
        `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com>`_ web framework.
        
        PyGall is written by Bruno Binet and is licensed under a
        BSD permissive license.
        
        Code is hosted on github: https://github.com/inneos/PyGall.
        
        Be warned that this image gallery is beta software, and not full featured.
        It has been developped to fit my own needs, and may not suit your wishes.
        
        But that being said, feel free to create a new issue to report bugs or ask for
        new features at https://github.com/inneos/PyGall/issues.
        Even better, since the code is hosted on github, feel free to fork and send
        pull requests.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        PyGall currently provides the following basic features:
        
        * Upload photos through the browser. The photos are automatically scaled and
          rotated if needed.
          If using `F-Spot <http://f-spot.org/>`_ as your personal photo management
          desktop application, PyGall provides a script to automatically import photos
          from F-Spot.
        
        * Browse and view photos through a nice interface borrowed from
          `Galleria <http://galleria.aino.se/>`_.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        You should have a working setuptools (or distribute) environment. I advise
        you to use `virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to create
        an isolated Python environment.
        
        Prior to actually install PyGall and its dependencies, you should install the
        libjpeg and python development files, which are needed to compile the Python
        Imaging Library dependency.
        On Debian Linux you can do::
        
            $ sudo aptitude install build-essential libjpeg-dev python-dev
        
        Then you can install PyGall with the following command::
        
            $ easy_install PyGall
        
        PyGall is now installed. Let's generate a configuration file for your PyGall
        photo gallery::
        
            $ paster make-config PyGall pygall.ini
        
        The newly created ``pygall.ini`` file will be used by Paster to initialize
        the application, create the database, and serve your application.
        
        So you need to create the database::
        
            $ paster setup-app pygall.ini#pygall
        
        And finally, you can serve your PyGall application::
        
            $ paster serve pygall.ini
        
        That's all, you can point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 and start
        using PyGall. You're ready to import your first photos!

          supported by PIL though)
        
        * add missing PIL dependency and remove pyexiv2 system dependency so that
          pygall now works in an isolated virtual environment built with
          "virtualenv --no-site-packages"
        
        * improve installation instructions
