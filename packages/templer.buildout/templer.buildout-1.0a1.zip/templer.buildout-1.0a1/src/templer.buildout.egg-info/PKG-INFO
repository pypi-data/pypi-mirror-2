        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package extends the functionality of the templer code generation system. It
        builds upon the functionality of templer.core_, and depends on that package.
        This package provides basic support for creating buildouts and buildout recipes
        using zc.buildout_. Included are packages for basic buildout skeletons and
        buildout recipes.
        
        .. _templer.core: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/templer.core
        .. _zc.buildout: http://www.buildout.org/
        
        Creating Packages
        -----------------
        
        As with the parent package, templer.core, creating packages using
        templer.buildout templates is accomplished by using the ``templer`` script. The
        script is invoked thus::
        
        templer basic_buildout
        
        This will create a basic buildout skeleton, containing the zc.buildout
        bootstrap.py file and a buildout.cfg file which may be edited to taste.
        
        Other Functions
        ---------------
        
        The ``templer`` script provides a number of other functions, these are described
        in full on the index page for templer.core_ at PyPI_
