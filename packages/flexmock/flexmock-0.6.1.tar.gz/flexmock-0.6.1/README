Current Version: 0.6

FlexMock provides a mock/stub library for Python.
It is inspired by Ruby's FlexMock, however full feature parity with
the Ruby version is not a goal. It omits things in the Ruby
version that I think are less useful, like the zero_or_more_times
expectation for example. It also implements things that Ruby's FlexMock
doesn't support, such as proxying/spying using pass_thru.

SUPPORTS:

- unittest.TestCase integration, i.e. automatic expectation checking on tearDown
- advanced argument matching, including matching types and user-defined classes
- expectations on number of times called, including at_least/at_most
- mocks returning custom values, including different values on successive invokations
- mocks raising custom exceptions
- simple syntax for generating new mock objects
- overriding new instances (on new-style objects)
- parameter shortcuts for even terser syntax
- proxying/spying using the pass_thru expectation modifier
- enforcing expectations ordering

DOCUMENTATION:

Usage documentation is available on the github wiki:

TESTED WITH:

- python 2.4.4 on OSX
- python 2.5 on OSX
- python 2.6 on OSX
- python 3.1.2 on OSX
- should work with other versions and platforms
