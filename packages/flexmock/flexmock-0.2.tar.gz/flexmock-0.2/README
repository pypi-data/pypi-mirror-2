- and_raise()
- overriding new instances (on new-style objects)
- parameter shortcuts for with_args/and_return

FlexMock provides a mock/stub library for Python.
It is inspired by Ruby's FlexMock, however full feature parity with
the Ruby version is not a goal. I'm leaving out things in the Ruby
version that I think are less useful, like the zero_or_more_times()
expectation for example. I also plan on adding things that Ruby's FlexMock
doesn't support, and implement certain things in a different way.
