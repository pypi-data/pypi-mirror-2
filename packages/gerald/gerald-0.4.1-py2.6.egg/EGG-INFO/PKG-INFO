Description: 
        Gerald is a general purpose toolkit written in Python for cataloguing, managing
        and deploying database schemas. Its major current use is to identify the
        differences between various versions of a schema. A schema is a single logical
        grouping of database objects usually made up of tables, views and stored code
        objects (functions and procedures).
        
        You can use Gerald to determine the differences between your development and test
        environments, or to integrate changes from a number of different developers into
        your integration database.
        
        Gerald is designed to be used in an Agile environment, but is useful regardless
        of your development methodology.
        
        Gerald is designed from the ground up to support as many popular relational
        database systems as possible. Currently it will document and compare schemas
        from databases implemented in MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL. Other databases
        will be supported in future releases.
