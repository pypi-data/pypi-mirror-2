Contributing to Gerald 
======================

Introduction
------------

This document describes all of the ways you can contribute to the Gerald project.

Finding and Reporting Bugs
==========================

If you discover something in Gerald that doesn't work properly you can do one of two things:

#. Create a ticket at the `Trac repository`_ 
#. Send an email to andy47@halfcooked.com

Whichever route you chose, please remember to make the information relevant and if possible please include a way to re-create the problem you are seeing in as few steps as possible.

Source Code
===========

The project source code is in a Subversion_ repository at SourceForge_. All development work takes place on the trunk.

You can view it here http://halfcooked.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/halfcooked/trunk/ or check out a copy using::

    $ svn co https://halfcooked.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/halfcooked/trunk gerald

Task Management
===============

The project uses a tool called Trac_ hosted at SourceForge_ to manage development and bug fixing. This can be found at our `Trac repository`_

New development work, bugs and issues are handled by the Trac_ ticketing systems at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/halfcooked/report/1

Supporting New Databases
========================

A guide to adding support for different relational databases is included in the documentation. It is called :doc:`add_another_database`

Mailing List
============

There is no mailing list for Gerald users or developers. All email should be addressed to andy47@halfcooked.com
