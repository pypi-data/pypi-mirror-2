To Do

Future releases
    Add support for grants and synonyms
    Add unit tests for grants and synonyms
    Add a sort order when generating the DDL for a schema
    Add the ability get a subset of objects by type when initialising a schema
    Use case - I want all of the views owned by the a particular user (e.g. APPS) that isn't the schema owner
    Add the ability to get a subset of objects by name (based on a regexp?)
    Cross database DDL generation
      - Read a schema from Oracle, generate it as MySQL or PostgreSQL
    Add a command line utility to easily compare two schemas
    Do some serious work on the comparison and diff code, not least:
      - Start using the SequenceMatcher class from the difflib standard library module
    Improve the speed of the code when loading large schemas (e.g. Oracle APPS schema)
    Support database migrations (e.g. generate code to change schema 'A' to schema 'B')
