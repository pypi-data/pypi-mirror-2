Running the test suite
======================

The ``versions.tests`` package is set up as a project which defines models
and tests that can be invoked from the shell. You can run the tests with
the included script::

    ./runtests.py

Or, if you prefer, you can run the script with standard python package distribution testing.

    python setup.py test
