Description: ======================
        Zima imageboard engine
        ======================
        
        Zima is an imageboard engine that trys to keep all good things from
        `wakaba http://wakaba.c3.cx/`_ on the one side and introduces a couple
        of differences on the another.
        
        **Note Bene!** This is very early version of this software. Do not
         expect production quality, use it at your own risk.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Download source tarball unpack it and run::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        This will install ``zimabbs`` python package, ``zima.py`` and
        ``zwipe.py`` scripts in your ``local/bin`` directory and creates two
        directories:
        
        * ``/var/zima`` -- contains imageboard resources;
        * ``/etc/zima.d`` -- where configuration stores.
        
        To start server type::
        
            zima.py
        
        Using mongoDB and CherryPy
        ==========================
        
        By default zima uses it's own ad-hoc ``memory`` backend which keeps
        all data in ram and has no data persistency. This is useful for
        developing but not for production.
        
        Alternatively you can use mongoDb which keeps data more reliable. To
        plug mongoDb to zima you need to install ``pyMongo`` package. After
        that change ``db`` section of your config (which is
        ``/etc/zima.d/config.py``) in the following way::
        
            'db': {
                ...
                'backend': 'mongo',
                'iface': 'localhost:27017',
                },
        
        To use ``CherryPy`` server instead of bottle.py standart development
        server ``WSGIRefServer`` install CherryPy package and modify config in
        the following way::
        
            from bottle import CherryPyServer
        
            server = {
                ... 
                'frontend': CherryPyServer,
            }
