Description: ===========
        eAlarm
        ===========
        
        eAlarm is a simple, easy (thus the 'e') alarm that does what any alarm should do.  It's used from the command-line, because 'ctrl-c' is still perfectly accessible in the dark.::
        
            ----------
            ON *NIX
            ----------
        
            $ eAlarm
            
            OR
            
            $ python /path/to/eAlarm.py /optional/absolute/path/to/directory
            
            OR
            
            $ python /path/to/eAlarm.py
            >>> Enter a directory you'd like to sort: absolute/path/to/directory
            
            -----------
            ON WINDOWS:
            -----------
            
            Open a command prompt and type:
            
            C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\eAlarmgui.py
            
            OR
            
            C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\eAlarm.py
            
            (Or just double-click on whichever script)
        
        
        
        Requirements:
        ==============
        
        * Python 2.6 or later (2.6 recommended on Windows)
        
        * Pyglet (http://pyglet.org)
        
        * AVbin (http://code.google.com/p/avbin)
        
        
        Installation:
        ==============
        
        * In Unix:  Unpack the tarball, open a terminal, navigate to the directory in which you unpacked the tarball, and type (as admin, i.e., "su" or "sudo") ``python setup.py install``
        
        * In Windows, just run the .exe as normal.  The script will be installed to C:\\Pythondir\\Lib\\site-packages
        
        Usage
        -------------
        
        This program can be used interactively, or quickly.
        
        For the former, simply execute the program with no arguments.  You'll be brought to the intro page and presented with a few options.  You can just 'go', you can set the time (or any one of the nine preset times), or you can quit.
        
        For the latter, you can pass the program a time straight from the command-line.  To do so, you'd pass a time argument while invoking it.  For example, to immediately set the clock for 4:00 PM, you can type 'ealarm 16:00', 'ealarm 4pm', 'ealarm 16', etc.  It will also accept 'noon' or 'midnight' as a time argument.
        
        One other possibly important option is the 'test' option, to see whether or not the alarm will actually function on your system.  Better safe than sorry, right?  You can enter 'T' at the main (interactive) screen, or just type 'ealarm t' from the command line.  If after several seconds you still  don't hear anything, then you may want not want to use this program.
        
        There isn't much more to it than that, honestly.  It's a simple little alarm.
        
        
        After installation and running the program for the first time (or just running
        the script itself from wherever you've extracted it to), a configuration file
        will be created in the ealarm directory, located in one of the following
        directories:
        
        GNU/Linux:  ~/.ealarm
        Windows XP:  My Documents\\ealarm
        Windows 7 or Vista:  Documents\\ealarm
        
        You can edit the configuration file if you'd like (named 'ealarm.cfg') with any
        plain text editor.  You can set the ring sound, current time and preset times
        inside this cfg file.
