        This will inject the ckeditor directory in a browser Resources directory accessible in line
        using this adress::
        
        - http://yourplonesite/++resource++ckeditor/
        
        base2zope.py fix some tal compilation errors (zope.tal bugs), see also::
        
        - https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/142333
        
        base2zope.py fix also some XHTML errors in ckeditor tests pages.
        zope consider html files in browser resources as page templates and return a 404 http error
        in case of tal compilation error::
