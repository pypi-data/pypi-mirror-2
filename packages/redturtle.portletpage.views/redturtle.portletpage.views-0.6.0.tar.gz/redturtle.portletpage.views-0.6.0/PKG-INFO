Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Some additional views for the great `collective.portletpage`__ product.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.portletpage
        
        After installing this, while still having the default "*Two columns*" view, you can also rely on:
        
        `Just portlets`
        Show only the portlets section, hiding *Title* and *RichText* body.
        `No title`
        Show all sections, not the *Title*.
        `Tabbed regions`
        Show portlet columns with tabs, using Plone standard tabbed layout.
        
        When using the *Tabbed regions* view, you can see 1 to 4 tabs, taken from the portletpage columns
        (empty columns are not show).
        
        Default label for tabs is "*Section x*" where *x* is the column number. You can customize labels adding a
        new property (only through ZMI for now) to the Portlet Page content calling it "**tab_labels**"
        (type *lines*) and adding to it **4 values** that are used to be tab labels in order.
        
        Labels provided are translated using "*plone*" domain so you can provide i18n support in your themes or
        products for the values you put inside the property.
