littletable -- A Python in-memory database
==========================================

Introduction
============
littletable (formerly dulce) is a simple ORM-like wrapper for managing 
collections of Python objects like relational tables.  No schema 
definition is used; instead table columns are introspected from the 
attributes of objects inserted into the table, and inferred from index 
and query parameters.  

Tables can be:
- indexed
- queried
- joined
- pivoted
- imported from/exported to .CSV files

Also, every query or join returns a new full-fledged littletable Table 
- no distinction of Tables vs. DataSets vs. RecordSets vs. whatever.  
So it is easy to build up a complex database analysis from a succession 
of joins and queries.

littletable is a simple environment for experimenting with tables, 
joins, and indexing, with a minimum of startup overhead.  You can 
download littletable at http://sourceforge.net/projects/littletable/ -
