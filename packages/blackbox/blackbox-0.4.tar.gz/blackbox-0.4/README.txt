## About

This python module - simply called blackbox from here on - is intended to 
encapsulate most of the low level IRC protocol into handy, easily callable 
methods of an IRC object that contains the socket object.
It is mainly meant to be used in bots, but can of course be used for any 
other application communicating with an IRC server as well.

## Installation

Currently there is but one way to install blackbox: download the source and run setup.py
with the 'install' parameter (you might need adminstrative privileges). 

A PyPI entry for blackbox is in the works. Once that is done, you will be able to use 
[easy\_install](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall) or 
[pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install blackbox.


## Implementation Status & Roadmap

Coming again soon...
