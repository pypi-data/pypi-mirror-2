Description: 
        DataDiff
        ========
        
        DataDiff is a library to provide human-readable diffs of python data structures.
        It can handle sequence types (lists, tuples, etc), sets, and dictionaries.
        
        It has special-case handling for multi-line strings, showing them as a typical unified diff.
        Lists will be diffed recursively, when applicable.
        
        ``datadiff`` works on Python 2.5 through Python 3.

        Example
        -------
        
        Here's an example::
        
        >>> from datadiff import diff
        >>> a = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        >>> b = [2, 3, 4, 6]
        >>> print diff(a, b)
        --- a
        +++ b
        [
        @@ -0,4 +0,3 @@
        2,
        3,
        4,
        -5,
        6,
