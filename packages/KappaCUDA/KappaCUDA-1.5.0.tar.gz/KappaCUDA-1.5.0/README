Python module to give easy access to NVIDIA CUDA from Python using the
Kappa Library.  This module gives access (via the Kappa Library) to
all NVIDA CUDA driver functionality (a superset of the NVIDIA CUDA
runtime functionality).  Since the Kappa Library is written in C++ and
most (host) processing occurs within the Kappa library, the KappaCUDA
module gives CUDA performance comparable to a C++ CUDA driver program.
Since the Kappa Library automatically chooses NVIDIA suggested
performance optimizations for the given NVIDIA GPU's and implements
automatic concurrent CUDA kernel execution on FERMI GPU's, the
KappaCUDA module can give CUDA performance better than C++ CUDA driver
or runtime API programs (however, a hand tuned C++ Kappa Library or
CUDA driver program will be faster).

The (Commercial) Kappa Library is required and is available from
psilambda.com.  The Kappa Library requires an appropriate NVIDIA CUDA
GPU and driver--see the installation guides for the Kappa Library for
other prerequisites.
