Description: Introduction - valentine.linguaflow
        ===================================
        
        With this product your multilingual site will have the information to know
        
        * what translations are invalidate
        * what has changed
        * when was the change made
        
        If you use XLIFFMarshal to export/import your translations it will also
        automatically use this product to validate/re-invalidate a translation.
        
        How does it work
        ________________
        
        "Suppose to work" - not there yet, automatic invalidation is disabled as default
        
        valentine.linguaflow uses the capabilities of using multiple workflows for each
        content type. It ads a second workflow which has two transitions and states,
        invalidate/validate and invalid/valid. Every time a canonical content is changed
        subscribers will check if and language dependent fields have changed. If so
        it will invoke invalidate transition on each translation. In the comment of the
        transition it will save a diff of what has changed.
