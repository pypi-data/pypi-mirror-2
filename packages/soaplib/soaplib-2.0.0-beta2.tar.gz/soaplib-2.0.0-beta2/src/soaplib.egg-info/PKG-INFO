Description: This is a simple, easily extendible soap library that provides several useful
        tools for creating and publishing soap web services in python.  This package
        features on-demand wsdl generation for the published services, a
        wsgi-compliant web application, support for complex class structures, binary
        attachments, and a simple framework for creating additional serialization 
        mechanisms.
        
        This project uses lxml as it's XML API, providing full namespace support.
