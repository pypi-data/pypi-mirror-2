Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        z3c.suds manages a connection pool of `suds`_ client objects in the context of
        a ZODB-based application.  (suds is a lightweight client library for consuming
        SOAP web services in Python.)  Using it avoids the need for instantiating a new
        client for the same webservice in multiple requests (which may be expensive due
        to parsing WSDL, etc.)
        
        .. _`suds`: https://fedorahosted.org/suds/
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        A client may be obtained via the `get_suds_client` method::
        
          client = get_suds_client(wsdl_uri, context=None)
        
        This returns an existing suds client if one is found in the cache for the given
        WSDL; otherwise it returns a new client object and stores it in the cache.
        
        `wsdl_path` is the URI of the WSDL (web service definition language)
        description of the web service. (Use a file:// URI for a locally stored WSDL.)
        
        `context` is a persistent object (in the ZODB sense). If not provided, the
        `getSite` method of zope.site.hooks will be used to obtain an object (which
        is probably only sensible within the context of a Zopish framework). If the
        context object is associated with a ZODB connection, the client will be cached
        in the connection's `foreign_connections` dictionary. If the context object is
        not yet associated with a ZODB connection, the client will be cached in a
        volatile attribute instead. This approach to piggybacking a pool of connections
        on the ZODB connection pool is based on `alm.solrindex`, and further documented
        there.
