Description: Django Postmark
        ===============
        
        django-postmark is a reusable app that includes an EmailBackend for sending email
        with Django as well as models and view that enable integration with Postmark's
        bounce hook api.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install django postmark with pip by typing::
        
            pip install django-postmark
            
        Or with easy_install by typing::
        
            easy_install django-postmark
            
        Or manually by downloading a tarball and typing::
        
            python setup.py install
            
        Once installed add `postmark` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and run::
        
            python manage.py syncdb
            
        Django Configuration
        --------------------
        
        If you want to use django-postmark as your default backend, you should add::
        
            EMAIL_BACKEND = "postmark.backends.PostmarkBackend"
        
        to your settings.py
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        django-postmark adds 1 required setting and 2 optional settings.
        
        Required:
            Specifies the api key for your postmark server.::
        
                POSTMARK_API_KEY = 'POSTMARK_API_TEST'
            
        Optional:
            Specifies a username and password that the view will require to be passed
            in via basic auth. (http://exampleuser:examplepassword@example.com/postmark/bounce/)::
            
                POSTMARK_API_USER = "exampleuser"
                POSTMARK_API_PASSWORD = "examplepassword"
            
        Postmark Bounce Hook
        --------------------
        
        Postmark has the optional ability to POST to an url anytime a message you have
        sent bounces. django-postmark comes with an urlconf and view for this purpose. If
        you wish to use this then add::
        
            url(r"^postmark/", include("postmark.urls")),
            
        to your root urls.py. This will cause your bounce hook location to live
        at /postmark/bounce/. Then simply add in the url to your Postmark settings (with
        the username and password specified by POSTMARK_API_USER/PASSWORD if set) and
        django will accept POSTS from Postmark notifying it of a new bounce.
