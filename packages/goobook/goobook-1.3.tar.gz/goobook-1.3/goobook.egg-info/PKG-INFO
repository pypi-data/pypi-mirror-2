        About
        =====
        
        The purpose of GooBook is to make it possible to use your Google Contacts from
        the command-line and from MUAs such as Mutt.
        It can be used from Mutt the same way as abook.
        
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        There is a number of ways to install Python software.
        
        - Using pip
        - Using easy_install
        - Using a source tarball
        - Using source directly from gitorius
        - From a distribution specific repository (Arch Linux AUR)
        
        pip or easy_install
        -------------------
        
        This is the recommended way to install goobook for most users.
        When installing this way you will not need to download anything manually.
        
        Run pip or easy_install::
        
            $ pip install goobook
            $ easy_install -U goobook
        
        easy_install is part of setuptools which should come with most distributions,
        pip is a newer replacement.
        
        Source installation
        -------------------
        
        Download the source tarball, uncompress it, then run the install command::
        
            $ tar -xzvf goobook-*.tar.gz
            $ cd goobook-*
            $ sudo python ./setup.py install
        
        Upgrading from < 1.0
        --------------------
        
        If you are upgrading from a pre 1.0 version you will have to remove the old
        cachefile and create a new configuration.
        
        Configure
        =========
        
        For most users it will be enough to add an entry to your ~/.netrc::
        
            machine google.com
              login your@google.email
              password secret
        
        NOTE: The netrc implementation in Python don't support passwords with spaces, use the .goobookrc instead.
        
        To get access too more settings you can create a configuration file::
        
            goobook config-template > ~/.goobookrc
        
        It will look like this::
        
            # "#" or ";" at the start of a line makes it a comment.
            [DEFAULT]
            # If not given here, email and password is taken from .netrc using
            # machine google.com
            ;email: user@gmail.com
            ;password: top secret
            # The following are optional, defaults are shown
            ;cache_filename: ~/.goobook_cache
            ;cache_expiry_hours: 24
        
        
        If you set the password to "prompt" you will be prompted each time the password is needed
        but this do not work well with mutt.
        
        Instead of being a plain config file ``.goobookrc`` can be an executable,
        in which case it's output will be used as configuration.
        
        For example if you want to store your configuration encrypted with GnuPG as ``.goobookrc.gpg``
        you can use a ``.goobookrc`` like this::
        
            #!/bin/sh
            gpg --no-tty --use-agent -q -d ~/.goobookrc.gpg
        
        You will need to have a appropriate gpg-agent/pinentry setup, you will not be prompted
        for the gpg passphrase on the console.
        
        Proxy settings
        --------------
        
        If you use a proxy you need to set the https_proxy environment variable.
        
        Mutt
        ----
        
        If you want to use goobook from mutt.
        
        Set in your .muttrc file::
        
            set query_command="goobook query '%s'"
        
        to query address book. (Normally bound to "Q" key.)
        
        If you want to be able to use <tab> to complete email addresses instead of Ctrl-t add this:
        
            bind editor <Tab> complete-query
        
        To add email addresses (with "a" key normally bound to create-alias command)::
        
            macro index,pager a "<pipe-message>goobook add<return>" "add the sender address to Google contacts"
        
        If you want to add an email's sender to Contacts, press a while it's selected in the index or pager.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To query your contacts::
        
            $ goobook query QUERY
        
        The add command reads a email from STDIN and adds the From address to your Google contacts::
        
            $ goobook add
        
        The cache is updated automatically according to the configuration but you can also force an update::
        
            $ goobook reload
        
        For more commands see::
        
            $ goobook -h
        
        and::
        
            $ goobook COMMAND -h

        * Issue 14: Only search in these fields: name, nick, emails, group name.
          In 1.1 the group URL was also searched, which gave false positives.

        1.0, 2010-02-20
        ---------------
        
        * Issue 2: BadAuthentication error can create a problematic cache file so
          subsequent runs fail
        * Issue 6: cache management needs improvements
          - reload, force refresh command
          - configurable cache expiry time
        * Issue 7: Should probably set safe permissions on settings.pyc
        * Issue 8: 'add' doesn't strip extraneous quotation marks
        * Issue 9: Indentation error when run without arguments
        * Issue 10: Query doesn't browse nicknames
