Description: 
        Playdoh is a pure Python library for distributing computations across the free computing units 
        (CPUs and GPUs) available in a small network of multicore computers. Playdoh supports independent 
        (embarassingly) parallel problems as well as loosely coupled tasks such as global optimizations, 
        Monte Carlo simulations and numerical integration of partial differential equations. It is designed 
        to be lightweight and easy to use and should be of interest to scientists wanting to turn their lab 
        computers into a small cluster at no cost.
