class ClusterManager(object):
    '''
    ClusterManager is used for managing a cluster.
    
    To use the clustertools module, you have to do the following:
    
    * Write a class work_class as described below, this is the user
      class in charge of doing the actual task.
    * Create shared_data that each process can read from but not write
      to.
    * Run worker machines using cluster_worker_script.
    * Create a ClusterManager
    * Submit jobs to ClusterManager
    * Close the ClusterManager connection
    
    In addition, you can specify the number of GPUs and CPUs you
    want to use on this computer with own_max_gpu and own_max_cpu.
    You can also specify a policy of how to deal with mixed GPUs and
    CPUs (see policies below).
    
    The machines argument should be a list of host/IP names (if using IP)
    or machine names (if using Windows named pipes). If IP is being used
    you can specify a port with the port keyword. Set named_pipe=True if
    using named pipes, or to a string to use a particular named pipe.
    Set authkey to a shared password for authentication. For named pipes,
    note that the user of the manager computer has to have a logon on
    each worker with the same ID and password.
    
    **work_class**
    
    Work class should follow the following template::

        class work_class(object):
            def __init__(self, shared_data, use_gpu):
                ...
            def process(self, job):
                ...
    
    The __init__ method is called on creation by cluster tools with
    the shared data specified, and whether or not to use the GPU if
    available (following the GPU policy). The process method is called
    with each job submitted and should return some values. Note that
    all shared_data, job and return values from process should be
    picklable.
    
    **shared_data**
    
    Shared data is read-only. It should be a dictionary, whose values
    are picklable. If the values are numpy arrays, and the data is being
    shared to processes on a given computer, the memory will not be
    copied, but a pointer passed to the child processes, saving memory.
    Large read-only data to be shared should be put in here.
    
    **GPU policies**
    
    The policies are 'prefer_gpu' (default) which will use only GPUs if
    any are available on any of the computers, 'require_all' which will
    only use GPUs if all computers have them, or 'no_gpu' which will
    never use GPUs even if available.
    
    **Using the ClusterManager object**
    
    After the object is initialised, it has an attribute:
    
    ``total_processes``
        The total number of processes on the cluster, so that you can 
        divide work up appropriately.
    
    and methods:
    
    ``process_jobs(jobs)``
        This will process a list of jobs, where the size of the list
        should be ``total_processes``.
    ``finished()``
        Should be called after all jobs have been finished.
