= Playdoh Worker GUI =

The Playdoh Worker GUI is a tool you install on every machine of your cluster
in order to make them available for your distributed computations.
There is a Windows executable 'PlaydohWorker.exe' and a Python GUI working on
Windows and Unix 'PlaydohWorker.py'.

== Usage ==

You have to install the .NET Framework 3.5 if it's not already installed (it's already installed
on Windows 7) if you want to use the Windows executable. 
You also need to have a valid installation of Python and Playdoh on each computer.
Then, you just run `PlaydohWorker.exe` or 'python PlaydohWorker.py', and the computer 
will automatically enter the job queue (you need to press the Start button first
on the Python GUI). It will then run any job it receives.

== Parameters (Windows) ==

You can access the parameters by double-clicking the Playdoh icon in the Windows Tray Icons.
You can set the number of CPUs and GPUs to use, and wheter to use Named Pipes or not. Also,
you can stop or restart the worker. The output console shows you the current state of the worker
(waiting, running, or stopped). When a job is requested by the manager, a message appears in
the Windows Tray Icon. You can disable these messages by right-clicking on the Playdoh icon
and selecting `Disable notifications`.

== Notes (Windows) ==

  * You can make this tool start automatically at Windows startup by creating a shortcut
    in the Startup folder of the Windows start menu.
  * Your parameters are automatically saved when you close the tool.
