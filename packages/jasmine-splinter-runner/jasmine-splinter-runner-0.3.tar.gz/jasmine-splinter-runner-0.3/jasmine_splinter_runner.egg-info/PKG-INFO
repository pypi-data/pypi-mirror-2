        =======================
        
        `Jasmine <http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/>`_ runner based on `splinter <http://splinter.cobrateam.info>`_.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        You can install ``jasmine-splinter-runner`` using pip: ::
        
            $ [sudo] pip install jasmine-splinter-runner
        
        Using
        -----
        
        After install it, all you need to do is run the command ``jasmine-splinter`` in your terminal: ::
        
            $ jasmine-splinter
        
        You can use some options:
        
            -u URL, --url=URL
                            the runner url
        
            -f FILE_PATH, --filepath=FILE_PATH
                            runner file path
        
            -b BROWSER.DRIVER, --browser-driver
                            splinter browser driver (check splinter docs for available drivers)
        
        
        By default this command will look for a file called ``SpecRunner.html`` and run these specs.
