Description: Complete like Eclipse
        =====================
        
        Default word completion on ``Tab`` key with auto popuped word list is too annoying.
        So I rewrote original plugin to emulate Eclipse behavior:
        pressing ``<alt>+slash`` cycles through possible completions.
