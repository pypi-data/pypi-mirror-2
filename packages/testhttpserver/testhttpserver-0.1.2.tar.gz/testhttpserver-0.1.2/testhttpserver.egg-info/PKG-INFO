Description: Test HTTP Server
        ================
        
        This is a simple HTTP server that will respond to a single HTTP request and
        record some of the data. It is still an early version and doesn't do
        everything you probably want.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        pip install testhttpserver
        
        Using in your tests
        ===================
        
        To create a test server import the server
        
        from testhttpserver import Server
        
        And then create a new instance including the port, response status and
        content.
        
        server = Server(8000, response_status=200, response_content='Content')
        
        After you make your request to http://localhost:8000/ . If you POST to the
        server it will have ``post_headers`` and ``post_content`` available.
        
        When you are done remember to ``join()``!
        
        server.join()
        
        See ``tests/test_server.py`` for an example!
