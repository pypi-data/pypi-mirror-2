Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A simple video support for Plone, based on `collective.flowplayer`__.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer
        
        This add to your Plone portal two new content types:
        
        * *Video file* for providing a video content directly from a video file compatible with flowplayer
        formats
        * *Video link* for a remote video resource
        
        New content types have mandatory image field, for the video screenshot/splash data.
        Also you can insert the *year* of the video and the *duration*. This last info is also taken
        automatically from the video (only for internal video).
        
        All other given feature cames directly from collective.flowplayer.
        
        Portlet
        -------
        
        Also this will give you a new "*Video gallery*" portlet, similar to the ones you'll get with
        collective.flowplayer. This new portlet shows image fields content taken from videos.
        
        Support for remote video services
        ---------------------------------
        
        The *Video link* content type handle URL not only to .flv or other compatible flowplayer resource, but
        also to 3rd party video services.
        
        Right now URL to those services are handled:
        
        * Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/)
        * Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/)
        
        You are invited to help us extending also to other services.
