Description: .. contents:: **Table of contents**
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        A simple video support for Plone, mainly based on `collective.flowplayer`__.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer
        
        Features
        ========
        
        This add to your Plone portal two new types:
        
        * *Video file* for providing a video content directly from a video file compatible with flowplayer
          formats. In the video view you can copy/paste the video embedding code, for seeing this video in other
          sites.
        * *Video link* for a remote video resource
        
        Also you can insert the *year* of the video and the *duration*.
        
        A "Look" section will also give you fields for:
        
        * add an optional image field, for the video screenshot/splashscreen data
        * video display size
        
        Internal video
        --------------
        
        Add to your site a new "Video file", then provide a video format compatible with `Flowplayer`__.
        When you save it RedTurtle Video try to take from the video source some metadata like the *duration*
        and video size (width and height). Later you can modify those values manually.

           :alt: Video file example
        
        If you provided also the image field, this can be used (optionally) as video starting splash image.
        All other amazing features came directly from the power of ``collective.flowplayer``.
        
        Remote video
        ------------
        
        Always wrapping ``collective.flowplayer`` features, you can provide a special kind of link that point to
        a compatible format resource. Again you can play with all additional fields, adjusting video size and
        metadata.
        
        The link can be to a remote site that host ``flv`` of other compatible types, or a link to an "Video file"
        in the same Plone site.
        
        Remote video providers
        ----------------------
        
        One of the most interesting feature is the support to *URL to 3rd party remote video services* like:
        
        * YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/) - using `collective.rtvideo.youtube`__
        * Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/) - still internal feature
        * Metacafe (http://www.metacafe.com/) - still internal feature
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/redturtle-video-0.4.0-02.png
           :alt: Video link to a YouTube resource
        
        Enhancing this list with additional providers is quite simple (see the `documentation`__ given with the product).
        You are welcome to contribute and release other ``collective.rtvideo.yourpreferredremoteservice`` add-on!

        Portlet
        -------
        
        Also this will give you a new "*Video gallery*" portlet, similar to the ones you'll get with
        ``collective.flowplayer`` ("Video player").
        
        This portlet will show links to a configurable set of videos, displaying in the portlet the splash image.
        
        You can still use basic "Video player" portlet given by ``collective.flowplayer``.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Tested on Plone 3.2, 3.3 and 4.0.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using buildout::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                redturtle.video
        
        To add also additional video providers support::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                redturtle.video
                collective.rtvideo.youtube
                ...
                mycompany.myservice
        
        Plone 3.2 or lower users: don't forget ``zcml`` section.
        
        Support
        =======
        
        If you find bugs or have a good suggestion, open a ticket at
        http://plone.org/products/redturtle.video/issues/
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * video transcript field: can be useful?
        * move away, to other packages named ``collective.rtvideo.xxx``, all video adapters left.
          It's silly to release a new ``redturtle.video`` version if something change on one of the remote services.

        Other products
        ==============
        
        Before choosing this product think about what you want to get from "Plone and Video".
        We strongly suggest you to use ``redturtle.video`` only when:
        
        * The simple use of ``collective.flowplayer`` if not enough (you don't like to upload a "File" that magically
          became a Video? You need remote video support? You need a real new plone content type to make Collections?)
        * The use of `Plumi`__ suite is "too much" (you don't need a full video site, just a simple video support inside
          you CMS)
        * You need to have Video as real CMS contents, not only use them embedded in document text (a task that you can
          reach easily using `collective.embedly`__)
        
        You can also be interested looking at the `Plone Video Suite`__ discussions.
