Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A simple video support for Plone, based on `collective.flowplayer`__.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer
        
        This add to your Plone portal two new content types:
        
        * *Video file* for providing a video content directly from a video file compatible with flowplayer
          formats
        * *Video link* for a remote video resource 
        
        New content types have mandatory image field, for the video screenshot/splash data.
        Also you can insert the *year* of the video and the *duration*. This last info is also taken
        automatically from the video (only for internal video).
        
        All other given featured come directly from collective.flowplayer.
        
        Portlet
        -------
        
        This package will give you a new "*Video gallery*" portlet, similar to the ones you get with
        collective.flowplayer. The portlet shows image fields content taken from videos.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * hachoir_core
        * hachoir_metadata
        * hachoir_parser
        * collective.flowplayer
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        Right now year and duration are not displayed in the video view.
        
        Other products
        ==============
        
        **AKA: are you sure you wanna use me?**
        
        If you are using *Plone 3.3* or better, before us this product, take a look at
        `Plone Video Suite`__.
        The redturtle.video product was developed in sad days, when the only choice was
        p4a.video (and this scare us a lot). The Plone Video Suite can became the next generation,
        unified, product to use video contents inside Plone!
