        Introduction
        ============
        
        A simple video support for Plone, mainly based on `collective.flowplayer`__.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer
        
        New content types
        =================
        
        This add to your Plone portal two new types:
        
        * *Video file* for providing a video content directly from a video file compatible with flowplayer
          formats. In the video view you can copy/paste the video embedding code, for seeing this video in other
          sites.
        * *Video link* for a remote video resource
        
        Those types have mandatory image field, for the video screenshot/splashscreen data.
        
        Also you can insert the *year* of the video and the *duration*.
        
        Internal video
        --------------
        
        Add to your site a new "Video file", then provide a video format compatible with `Flowplayer`__.
        When you save it RedTurtle Video try to take from the video source some metadata like the *duration*
        and video size (width and height). Later you can modify those values manually.

           :alt: Video file example
        
        If you provided also the image field, this can be used (optionally) as video starting splash image.
        
        No more... all other features came directly from the power of ``collective.flowplayer``.
        
        Remote video
        ------------
        
        Again wrapping ``collective.flowplayer`` features, you can provide a special kind of link that point to
        a compatible format resource. Again you can play with all additional fields, adjusting video size and
        metadata.
        
        However the most interesting feature is the support to *URL to 3rd party remote video services* like:
        
        * Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/)
        * Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/)
        * Metacafe (http://www.metacafe.com/)
        * Google Video (http://video.google.com/)
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/redturtle-video-0.4.0-02.png
           :alt: Video link example
        
        Enhancing this list with additional providers is quite simple (see the `documentation`__ given with the product).

        Portlet
        =======
        
        Also this will give you a new "*Video gallery*" portlet, similar to the ones you'll get with
        collective.flowplayer ("Video player").
        
        This portlet will show links to a configurable set of videos, displaying in the portlet the splash image.
        
        You can still use basic "Video player" portlet given by ``collective.flowplayer``.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Tested on Plone 3.2, 3.3 and 4.0.
        
        Support
        =======
        
        If you find bugs or have a good suggestion, open a ticket at
        http://plone.org/products/redturtle.video/issues/
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * video transcript field can be useful?
        * move away, to other packages, all video adapters. It's silly to release a new ``redturtle.video`` version if
          something change on one of the remote services.

        Other products
        ==============
        
        Before choosing this product think about what you want to get from "Plone and Video".
        We strongly suggest you to use redturtle.video only when:
        
        * The simple use of collective.flowplayer if not enough (you don't like to upload a "File" that magically
          became a Video? You need remote video support? You need a real new plone content type to make Collections?)
        * The use of `Plumi`__ suite is "too much" (you don't need a full video site, just a simple video support inside
          you CMS)
        * You need to have Video as real CMS contents, not only use them embedded in document text (a task that you can
          reach easily using `collective.embedly`__)
        
        You can also be interested looking at the `Plone Video Suite`__ discussions.
