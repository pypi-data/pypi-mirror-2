0.2 (2010-09-06)
----------------

- Removed ``repoze.bfg.mako`` functions named ``render_template``,
  ``render_template_to_response``, ``get_template`` and
  ``get_renderer``.  As of ``repoze.bfg`` 1.3a6, use of these
  functions should be replaced with usage of similarly-named functions
  present in the ``repoze.bfg.renderers`` module .

- Added integration tests for imperative rendering and ZCML loading.
