0.3 (2010-09-19)
----------------

- A ``repoze.bfg.mako`` renderer may now be called with a *tuple*,
  consisting of two values in the form ``(function_name, values)``.
  If a tuple is provided to a renderer, the ``def`` named after
  ``function_name`` in the template is rendered instead of the entire
  template using the ``values`` provided, which must be a dictionary).

0.2 (2010-09-06)
----------------

- Removed ``repoze.bfg.mako`` functions named ``render_template``,
  ``render_template_to_response``, ``get_template`` and
  ``get_renderer``.  As of ``repoze.bfg`` 1.3a6, use of these
  functions should be replaced with usage of similarly-named functions
  present in the ``repoze.bfg.renderers`` module .

- Added integration tests for imperative rendering and ZCML loading.

0.1 (2010-07-24)
----------------

- Initial release.
