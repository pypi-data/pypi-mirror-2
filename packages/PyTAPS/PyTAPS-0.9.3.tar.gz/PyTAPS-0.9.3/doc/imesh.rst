   :synopsis: Basic services to manage a discrete mesh composed of sets of
              entities.

Mesh
====

.. class:: Mesh([options])

   Return a new :class:`Mesh` object with any implementation-specific options
   defined in `options`.

   :param options: Implementation-specific options string

   .. attribute:: rootSet

      Return the handle of the root set for this instance. The entire mesh in
      this instance can be accessed from this set.

   .. attribute:: geometricDimension

      Get/set the geometric dimension of mesh represented in this instance.
      When setting the dimension, an application should not expect this
      function to succeed unless the mesh database is empty (no vertices
      created, no files read, etc.)

   .. attribute:: defaultStorage

      Return the default storage order used by this implementation.

   .. attribute:: adjTable

      Return the adjacency table for this implementation.  This table is a 4x4
      matrix, where `adjTable[i][j]` represents the relative cost of retrieving
      adjacencies between entities of dimension `i` to entities of dimension
      `j`.

   .. method:: areEHValid(reset)

      Return whether entity handles have changed since last reset or since
      instance construction. If true, it is not guaranteed that a handle from
      before the last call to this function represents the same entity as the
      same handle value does now. If `reset` is true, resets the starting
      point for this function.

      :param reset: If true, perform a reset on the starting point after
                    which handles are invariant.

               topologies.

Forwarding
----------

method calls to the root :class:`EntitySet`. Thus, ::

is equivalent to::

  mesh.rootSet.getEntities(iBase.Type.all, iMesh.Topology.all)
