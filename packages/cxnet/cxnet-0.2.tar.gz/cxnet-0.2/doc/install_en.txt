Introduction
===============

The CXNet package extends IGraph module with some functionality.
It in intended to usein higher education.
Some functionality is available with NetworkX module as well.
Function plotting needs matplotlib (pylab).

It provides to modules: cxnet and network_evolution.

Functionalities:

- Creating network from the deb package hierarchy.

- Investigating and plotting degree distribution.

- Graph methods:

 * to list the vertices with most degrees,

 * to plot the neighbours of a vertex.

- A tool to create network evolution models.

Requirements

    The dependencies of the CXNet package

To most of the functionality of CXNet you need to have
`IGraph <http://igraph.sourceforge.net>`_ or `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_ installed.
The installation of IGraph is `detailed on Wikidot <http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph>`_.

Some funcionality needs:

* `the matplotlib plotting tool (including pylab) <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
* `python-apt <http://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/>`_,
* `python-pygraphviz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz>`_,

Installation
==================================================

You can use the standard installation method. Download the source
(.tar.gz) manually from the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cxnet>`_, and install it::

  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/c/cxnet/cxnet-0.2.tar.gz
  tar xzf cxnet-0.2.tar.gz
  cd cxnet-0.2
  python setup.py install

On UNIX/Linux platform for the last step you need to have administrator
privilege, so use su or sudo if you are not root.
If you have not administrator privileges, you can work in the uncompressed
directory as well.
For the network evolution part it is the only working method yet.

If you have easy-install or pip installed, you just need to type::

  easy-install cxnet
  or
  pip install cxnet

On UNIX/Linux platform you need to have administrator privilege, so use su or
sudo if you are not root.
