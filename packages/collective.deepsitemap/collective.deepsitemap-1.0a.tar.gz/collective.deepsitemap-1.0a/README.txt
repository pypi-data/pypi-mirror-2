Introduction
============

This is a sitemap replacement that:

* shows only a branch of the tree, if called in a context different than the site root
* takes a ``sitemapDepth`` request parameter, overriding the global one in navtree_properties

Both features are available to users with the ``collective.deepsitemap: Use Deep Sitemap`` permission
(by default for Manager).

Note
----

This product keep the normal Plone behavior with the "sitemap" link. The additional parameter is designed
for "one-time" request, for special needs of the site administrator.
