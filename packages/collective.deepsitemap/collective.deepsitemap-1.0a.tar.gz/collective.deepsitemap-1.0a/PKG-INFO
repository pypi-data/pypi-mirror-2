Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a sitemap replacement that:
        
        * shows only a branch of the tree, if called in a context different than the site root
        * takes a ``sitemapDepth`` request parameter, overriding the global one in navtree_properties
        
        Both features are available to users with the ``collective.deepsitemap: Use Deep Sitemap`` permission
        (by default for Manager).
        
        Note
        ----
        
        This product keep the normal Plone behavior with the "sitemap" link. The additional parameter is designed
        for "one-time" request, for special needs of the site administrator.
