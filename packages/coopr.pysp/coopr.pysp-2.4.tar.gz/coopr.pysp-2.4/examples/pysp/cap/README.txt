The models in this directory are taken directly from the stochastic capacity 
expansion problem CAP/SCAP described in "A Multi-Stage Stochastic Integer 
Programming Approach for Capacity Expansion Under Uncertainty" by Ahmed,
King, and Parija, Journal of Global Optimization 26: 3--24, 2003.

The problem instances are labled "p_x_y", where x is the number of stages,
and y is the number of resources.
