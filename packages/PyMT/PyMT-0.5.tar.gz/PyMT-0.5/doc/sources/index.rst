Welcome to PyMT's documentation!
================================

PyMT is an open source library for developing multi-touch applications. It is
completely cross platform (Linux/OSX/Win) and released under the terms of the
GNU LGPL.

It comes with native support for many multi-touch input devices, a growing
library of multi-touch aware widgets, hardware accelerated OpenGL drawing,
and an architecture that is designed to let you focus on building custom and
highly interactive applications as quickly and easily as possible.

Since PyMT is a pure Python library, you can take advantage of its highly
dynamic nature and use any of the thousands of high quality and open source
python libraries out there.
