Description: ***************************
        Generic Transparent Proxies
        ***************************
        
        Proxies are special objects which serve as mostly-transparent
        wrappers around another object, intervening in the apparent behavior of
        the wrapped object only when necessary to apply the policy (e.g., access
        checking, location brokering, etc.) for which the proxy is responsible.
        
        Editorial note:
        
           Unfortunately, we don't have separate documentation for zope.proxy
           at this time.  This is a shame because the are generically useful.
           We are publishing this release without documentation mainly because
           it is a dependency of other releases.
