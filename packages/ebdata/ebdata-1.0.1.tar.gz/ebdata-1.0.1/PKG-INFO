        Installation
        ============
        
        Do *not* just try to easy_install or pip install ebdata.  It has a lot
        of specific dependencies which can't/shouldn't be captured by
        setup.py.
        
        Instead, see the full documentation at http://openblockproject.org/docs/install/index.html which includes links to pip requirements files
        and instructions on preparing your system.

        OpenBlock is a web application that allows users to browse and search
        their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see what's going on
        recently in the immediate geographic area.
        
        For installation instructions and other documentation, see
        http://openblockproject.org/docs/ (or the .rst files in the docs/ directory).
        
        For help, you can try the ebcode group:
        http://groups.google.com/group/ebcode
        or look for us in the #openblock IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
        
        
        About the Project
        =================
        
        OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
        Everyblock.com in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
        and the Everyblock team, it is now developed as an open-source (GPL)
        project by at http://openblockproject.org.
        
        Funding for the initial creation of Everyblock and the ongoing
        development of OpenBlock has been provided by the Knight Foundation
        (http://www.knightfoundation.org/).
        
        
        
        OpenBlock 1.0.1 (Sept 7, 2011)
        ====================================
        
        This is a minor bugfix (and docs) release, and is mostly identical to 1.0.0.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
         * The georss scraper now gets coordinates in the right order on the
           first try, and populates location_name if it falls back to
           geocoding.
        
         * Fix date formatting on newsitem-detail page. (ticket #201)
        
         * The ``import_blocks_tiger`` and ``import_blocks_esri`` scripts had
           a circular import.
        
         * Fix a broken doctest in bootsrap.py.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
         * Added docs for cloning an EC2 instance from our Amazon AMI.
        
         * Remove nonexistent ``--city`` option from geodata docs.
