Description: ======
        ebdata
        ======
        
        Code to help write scripts that import/crawl/parse data from the web
        into `ebpub <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ebpub>`_,
        as well as extract (US) street addresses from (English) text.
        
        This package is part of OpenBlock. Originally developed for EveryBlock.com.

        or the `project website <http://openblockproject.org>`_.
        
        Problems can be reported to the `issue tracker <http://developer.openblockproject.org>`_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Do *not* just try to easy_install or pip install ebdata.  It has a lot
        of specific dependencies which can't/shouldn't be captured by
        setup.py.
        
        Instead, see the full documentation at http://openblockproject.org/docs/install/index.html which includes links to pip requirements files
        and instructions on preparing your system.

        =========
        
        OpenBlock is a web application that allows users to browse and search
        their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see what's going on
        recently in the immediate geographic area.
        
        For installation instructions and other documentation, see
        http://openblockproject.org/docs/ (or the .rst files in the docs/ directory).
        
        For help, you can try the ebcode group:
        http://groups.google.com/group/ebcode
        or look for us in the #openblock IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
        
        
        About the Project
        =================
        
        OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
        Everyblock.com in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
        and the Everyblock team, it is now developed as an open-source (GPL)
        project by at http://openblockproject.org.
        
        Funding for the initial creation of Everyblock and the ongoing
        development of OpenBlock has been provided by the Knight Foundation
        (http://www.knightfoundation.org/).
        
        
        
        OpenBlock 1.0.0 (August 30, 2011)
        ====================================
        
        (This is largely unchanged from OpenBlock 1.0-beta1, so this is
        just a repeat of the release notes from that version, modulo a few
        small bug fixes.)
        
        Upgrade Notes
        -------------
        
        * If you originally installed, or already upgraded to, OpenBlock 1.0
          Beta, you may skip the rest of this section.
        
        * If you have an existing database that was built with 1.0a1 or
          earlier, you'll need to run this command to deal with the removal
          of the "django-apikey" dependency::
        
           django-admin.py migrate apikey 0001 --fake
        
        * Many data-loading scripts that were scattered all over the source
          tree are now installed into your environment's ``bin``
          directory, so they should be on your ``$PATH``.
          Documentation has been updated accordingly.
        
        * As usual, you should always run after upgrading::
        
           django-admin.py syncdb --migrate
        
          If you were unlucky and had last migrated with a git checkout
          including migrations that later got renamed or removed, you may get
          errors from migrating. In that case try adding the
          ``--delete-ghost-migrations`` option.
        
        * Production webserver configurations will need a line added to get the
          django-olwidget javascript and CSS to show up.
          For example, for Apache you'd add a line like (adjust path as needed)::
        
            Alias /olwidget/ /home/openblock/openblock/src/django-olwidget/
        
        * We now require Django 1.3. This probably doesn't have any impact on you.
          (ticket #155).
        
        * Settings changes:
        
          - MAP_BASELAYER_TYPE can now be any base layer supported by
            olwidget, eg. "google.streets".  (Some require other settings for
            eg. API keys; see ebpub/settings_default.py for comments and
            examples.)
        
          - You can add custom base layers to your maps by creating
            the dictionary settings.MAP_CUSTOM_BASE_LAYERS.
            See ebpub/settings_default.py for an example.
        
            This replaces the WMS_URL setting from openblock 1.0a1 which is no
            longer supported.
        
        
        New Features in 1.0 beta 1
        --------------------------
        
         * ticket #33: Different map icons for different news item types.
           To use this, you can use the admin UI to configure "map icon url"
           or "map color" for a Schema.
        
         * ticket #85: Added ``streets.PlaceType`` model for categorizing ``Places``.
           These also can have individual colors or icon URLs on the /maps/
           view.  (Original ticket title was "'Landmark' location type")
        
         * ticket #142: JSON push API for news items.
           See docs/main/api.rst
        
         * ticket #187: REST API standard features: API key provisioning;
           require keys (or auth) for POST / DELETE; throttling
        
         * Import US Zip Codes as Locations, via the admin UI.
        
         * Work-in-progress: user-submitted content. See code in the
           ebpub/neighbornews app.
        
         * Work-in-progress: Maps you can share just by copy/pasting a URL.
           For a sneak preview, browse to /maps/.
        
         * Much better admin UI maps. (ticket #140: Bad admin UI for GeometryFields)
        
         * ticket #72: unify NewsItem.attributes and NewsItem.attribute_values
        
         * ticket #52: Proper validation for Street Misspellings in admin
        
         * ticket #157: fill in normalized name automatically
        
         * ticket #123: Configurable base layer should apply to admin UI maps
           too
        
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        This is not a complete list; not all bugs fixed in this release were
        ticketed.
        
         * Fix #172: schema_detail view blows up (TypeError) if there are no
           NewsItems in the last 30 days, but there is a matching
           AggregateLocation. (That shouldn't happen, but evidently did with
           some boston demo schemas; also fixed a related possible off-by-one
           error that may have been a factor.)
        
         * Schema filter page: don't say 'You might want to try...' if there's
           nothing to try.
        
         * Fix bug where scrapers that create timezone-aware datetimes blow up
        
         * Fix errors in bounds checking in location importers, thanks to Bret
           Walker.
        
         * Fix missing import in Place admin
        
         * Fixed several bugs where django-nose (optional) would try to run
           some things that aren't tests.
        
         * ticket #110: Fix infinite loop if
           newsitem.schema.has_newsitem_detail is False but newsitem.url is
           empty; give 404 instead.
        
         * Importers should now not blow up if run more than once.
        
         * ticket #22: Scraper scripts in everyblock/cities/boston mostly
           don't work OOTB
        
         * ticket #79: Geotagging oddity
        
         * ticket #188: items.json doesn't include location_name
        
         * ticket #200: "obdemo bin scripts are documented, but don't get
           installed when installing obdemo non-editable"
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
         * ticket #80: Documentation for Street Misspellings
        
         * ticket #162: Document pip / easy_install workarounds
        
         * ticket #139: Document adding database user / granting database
           access
        
         * ticket #198: version number in documentation
        
         * ticket #197: documentation for deploying static media
        
         * Fix outdated paths to example scrapers.
        
         * Fix location of get_or_create_lookup
        
         * Note differences from everyblock
        
        Other
        -----
        
         * ticket #181: Prepare packages for distribution on pypi.
        
         * ticket #83: Split out non-core packages into a separate download
           (``ebblog``, ``ebwiki``, ``ebgeo``, ``ebinternal``, and ``everyblock`` are now
           at https://github.com/openplans/openblock-extras )
        
         * ticket #156: Removing lots of clustering code that's totally unused.
        
         * remove a redundant get_metro_bbox function from
           ebpub.utils.geodjango;  use get_default_bounds(), does the same thing.
