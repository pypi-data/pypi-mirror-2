Description: ``uncertainties`` allows calculation such as (0.2 +- 0.01)**2 = 0.04 +- 0.004
        to be performed transparently.
        
        **Correlations** between expressions are correctly taken into account 
        (``x-x`` is exactly zero, for instance).
        
        Basic examples::
        
            # Mathematical operations:
            x = uncertainties.Number_with_uncert((0.20, 0.01))  # x = 0.20+-0.01
            x = uncertainties.Number_with_uncert("0.20(1)")  # Other representation
            print x**2  # Prints "0.04+-0.004"
            print math.sin(x**2)  # Prints "0.0399...+-0.00399..."
        
            # Access to the value at the origin, and to the uncertainty:
            s = x**2  # Square
            print s  # Prints "0.04+-0.004"  
            print s.origin_value  # Prints "0.04"
            print s.std_dev()  # Prints "0.004..."
        
            print s.derivatives[x]  # Partial derivative: prints "0.4" (= 2*0.20)
        
            print s - x*x  # Exactly zero: correlations taken into account
        
        **Almost all mathematical operations** are supported, including most 
        functions from the standard math_ module and functions from the 
        third-party numpy_ module (fast operations on arrays and matrices).  
        There is no restriction on the complexity of the expressions, or on the 
        number of variables involved.
        
        Another possible use of this module is the calculation of **partial 
        derivatives** of mathematical functions.
        
        More examples and additional information can be obtained with ``pydoc 
        uncertainties`` after installation.
