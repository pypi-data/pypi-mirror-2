Description: ``uncertainties`` allows calculations such as (0.2 +/- 0.01)*2 = 0.4
        +/- 0.02 to be performed transparently; much more complex mathematical
        expressions involving numbers with uncertainties can also be evaluated
        transparently.
        
        **Correlations** between expressions are correctly taken into account.
        ``x-x`` is thus exactly zero, for instance (more naive implementations
        found on the web yield a non-zero uncertainty for ``x-x``, which is
        incorrect). Whatever the complexity of the calculation and the number
        of steps involved, the uncertainties produced by this program are what
        is predicted by `error propagation theory`_.
        
        
        Basic examples::
        
            from uncertainties import NumberWithUncert
            from uncertainties.umath import *  # sin(), etc.
        
            # Mathematical operations:
            x = NumberWithUncert((0.20, 0.01))  # x = 0.20+/-0.01
            x = NumberWithUncert("0.20(1)")  # Other representation
            print x**2  # Square: prints "0.04+/-0.004"
            print sin(x**2)  # Prints "0.0399...+/-0.00399..."
        
            print x.position_in_sigmas(0.17)  # Prints "-3.0": deviation of -3 sigmas
        
            # Access to the nominal value, and to the uncertainty:
            square = x**2  # Square
            print square  # Prints "0.04+/-0.004"  
            print square.nominal_value  # Prints "0.04"
            print square.std_dev()  # Prints "0.004..."
        
            print square.derivatives[x]  # Partial derivative: prints "0.4" (= 2*0.20)
        
            print square - x*x  # Exactly zero: correlations taken into account
        
        The Python_ (or IPython_) shell can thus be used as a powerful
        calculator that handles quantities with uncertainties (``print``
        statements are optional, which is convenient).
        
        **Almost all mathematical operations** are supported, including most 
        functions from the standard math_ module (sin,...) and functions from the 
        third-party numpy_ module (fast operations on arrays and matrices). 
        Comparison operators (``>``, ``==``, etc.) are supported too.  There is 
        no restriction on the complexity of mathematical expressions, or on the 
        number of variables involved (x-sin(x)+y**2-tan(y*x) can for example be 
        calculated, whether x and y are quantities with uncertainties or not).
        
        Another possible use of this module is the calculation of **partial 
        derivatives** of mathematical functions.
        
        Additional examples and information can be obtained with ``pydoc 
        uncertainties`` and ``pydoc uncertainties.umath`` after installation.

        *Installation*: ``sudo easy_install uncertainties`` might be
        sufficient, depending on your installation (this does not require any
        manual download, but requires setuptools_).  For additional
        installation methods, download the source archive, and see the
        ``README.txt`` file that it contains.
        
        *Version history* (main changes only):
        
        - 1.2.2: values with uncertainties are now output like 3+/-1, in order          to avoid confusing 3+-1 with 3+(-1).
        - 1.2: a new function, ``wrap()``, is exposed, which allows non-Python        functions (e.g. Fortran or C used through a module such as Scipy) to        handle numbers with uncertainties.
        - 1.1: mathematical functions (such as cosine, etc.) are in a new        uncertainties.umath module;        they do not override functions from the math module anymore.
        - 1.0.12: main class (``Number_with_uncert``) renamed ``NumberWithUncert``           so as to follow `PEP 8`_.
        - 1.0.11: ``origin_value`` renamed more appropriately as           ``nominal_value``.
        - 1.0.9: ``correlations()`` renamed more appropriately as          ``covariance_matrix()``.
