Description: 
        This is fassembler, the build system for OpenCore
        Home page: http://www.coactivate.org/projects/fassembler/project-home
        
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        This could be general-purpose build software a la GNU Make, Buildit,
        et al.  But it's developed specifically for the build and deployment
        needs of the software that runs CoActivate.org.

        Hacking Fassembler
        ===================
        
        
        To add a project
        ----------------
        
        * Create a subclass of fassembler.project:Project
        
        * Add an entry point to setup() in setup.py
        
        * Update doc/ports.txt and fassembler.topp:CheckBasePorts.port_range
        if needed.
        
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.5
        ===
        
        Add ``num_extra_zopes`` property to the environ object, which looks
        for a ``num_extra_zopes`` setting in the [general] section of
        build.ini and returns it as an integer or 0 if no such setting exists.
        
        This setting will then be used to fill in the value of
        ``opencore_remote_uri`` in the Frontend configuration, allowing the
        frontend to proxy to a load-balanced set of Zope instances.
        
        A ``num_extra_zopes`` setting has also been added to the fassembler:topp project, where it is saved to build.ini.
        
        0.4
        ===
        
        This is the first tag made for fassembler.  A lot happened before now but releases were never cut.
        
        In this release:
        
        * Added fassembler:extrazope project, which will build an additional Zope instance connected to the same ZEO server.
        
        * In fassembler:opencore, made the ``debug`` setting actually work, to control whether zope starts in debug mode when running ``./opencore/bin/zopectl fg`` (where it previously always ran with ``debug-mode=on``) or ``./bin/start-opencore`` (where it previously always ran with ``debug-mode=off`)
        
        * Added a setting ``never_create_virtualenv`` for fassembler.tasks.VirtualEnv, which, if set, makes that task act as an assertion of the given virtualenv's existence, so that a build can fail if the virtualenv hasn't already been created.
