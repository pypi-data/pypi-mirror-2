This is the first tag made for fassembler.  A lot happened before now but releases were never cut.

In this release:

* Added fassembler:extrazope project, which will build an additional Zope instance connected to the same ZEO server.

* In fassembler:opencore, made the ``debug`` setting actually work, to control whether zope starts in debug mode when running ``./opencore/bin/zopectl fg`` (where it previously always ran with ``debug-mode=on``) or ``./bin/start-opencore`` (where it previously always ran with ``debug-mode=off`)

* Added a setting ``never_create_virtualenv`` for fassembler.tasks.VirtualEnv, which, if set, makes that task act as an assertion of the given virtualenv's existence, so that a build can fail if the virtualenv hasn't already been created.
