------------------

  gets for the .cfg file
  Let's hope that buildout does not leave that password around.

  built-in xml library.

  trailing /

- Bug Fix: installer script would crash when no variants were found.

- Improvement: Building a package will no longer checkout the entire
  branch just to update the setup.py file with the new version
  number.  Instead only the top level directory is checked out.

- Bug Fix: project build script would crash when variant
  configuration was missing information required by its template. Now
  a helpful error message is printed and no files will be uploaded
  until all have been created successfully.

- Bug Fix: Typing Ctrl+c on the command line no longer causes a
  KeyboardInterrupt traceback to be spit out.

- Bug Fix: when running the installer, if the buildout command prompts
  the user for input, the installer will no longer eat up the prompt.
