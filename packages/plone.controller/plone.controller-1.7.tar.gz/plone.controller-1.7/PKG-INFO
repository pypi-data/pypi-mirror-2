Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.controller is a wxpython visual controller for Zope2 / Plone. Add it to a buildout
        with a part specification like::
        
            [controller]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = 
              plone.controller
        
        This will generate a script, bin/plone-controller to start the controller, reading the
        buildout.cfg in the current directory for configuration information. You may also specify
        the config file on the command line.
        
        The Python used for the buildout must include wx. This is not currently set as
        a "requires" for the package because wx has a very large number of dependencies.
        
        The controller provides a GUI for starting/stopping and checking the status of
        a Zope 2 intance.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.7 - 2010-07-31
        ----------------
        
        * Changed name on the "View Plone" button to "Create/View Plone site",
          clicking it now opens the new fancy Zope root page.
          [kleist]
        
        1.6 - 2009-08-18
        ----------------
        
        * Request privilege elevation.
          [sidnei]
        
        1.5
        ----------------
        
        * If buildout.cfg is not specified, and not in the current path,
          look for it in the path above the script.
        
        1.4
        ----------------
        
        * Added an icon set for Windows.
        
        1.3
        ----------------
        
        * Removed File and Help menu items. The only useful thing lost is
          access to the "about" page, and we should look for another way to
          provide that. [smcmahon]
        
        1.2
        ----------------
        
        * Import pywintypes and pythoncom before any other import of
          pywin32. This makes pywin32 find them correctly on a relocatable
          Python build. [sidnei]
        
        1.1
        ---
        
        * Turn off diagnostic messages unless the "DEBUG" environment
          variable is set. [smcmahon]
        
        * Search for buildout.cfg in current directory if
          no config file is specified on command line.
          [smcmahon]
        
        * Widen display and move sw to better fit sidnei's
          changes.
        
        1.0 - 2009-03-04
        ----------------
        
        * Eggified from XController, added dependency on
          collective.buildout.cluster [sidnei]
        
        * Initial release [sidnei]
