Description: django-cachebuster -- A backwards-compatible Django 1.3+ ready set of cache-busting template tags
        =================================================================================================
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        django-cachebuster is a Django app containing two template tags: ``static`` and ``media``.  Each tag will use the file last modified timestamp by default to 'bust' web browser file caches.  ``static`` is meant for your site's JavaScript, CSS and standard images.  ``media`` is intended for user uploaded content like avatars, videos and other files.
        
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        All of the existing file cache busting techniques seem to be Django versions 1.2.x and lower oriented - meaning they don't support the new ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` paradigm.  This app addresses this functionality gap.
        
        Additionally, there are some optimizations (see Advanced Settings below) that can be enabled to minimize file modification date disk reads.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 2.6 (May work with prior versions, but untested - please report)
        - Django 1.2.x, 1.3.x (May work with prior versions, but untested - please report)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        #. Copy or symlink the ``cachebuster`` package into your django project directory or install it by running one of the following commands:
        
            ``python setup.py install``
        
            or
        
            ``pip install django-cachebuster``
            
            or
        
            ``easy_install django-cachebuster``
        
        #. Add ``cachebuster`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's ``settings.py`` module.
        
        #. Use the ``{% static filename %}`` and ``{% media filename %}`` tags in your template files.
        
        
        Advanced Settings
        ----------------------
        
        ``CACHEBUSTER_UNIQUE_STRING``: **optional**; no default.
        
        If ``CACHEBUSTER_UNIQUE_STRING`` is not set, the file's last modified datetime will be used for cache-busting.  To set it, you would mostly likely use a ``cachebuster detector``; at the moment, there is a single **detector** available for ``git``.  It simply traverses the project's path looking for the ``.git`` folder, and then extracts the current commit hash.  The hash is cached and used for subsequent cache-busting.  For example, in your settings.py:
        
        ::
        
            from cachebuster.detectors import git
            CACHEBUSTER_UNIQUE_STRING = git.unique_string()
        
        or if you wanted it to be a short busting string:
        
        ::
        
            from cachebuster.detectors import git
            CACHEBUSTER_UNIQUE_STRING = git.unique_string()[:8]
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Please feel free to send a pull request with fixes and in particular, additional ``detectors`` to improve the usefulness of this app.  Maybe for ``svn``, ``hg``, etc?
