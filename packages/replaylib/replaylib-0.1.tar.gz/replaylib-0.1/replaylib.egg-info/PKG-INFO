        This (very experimental) library allows you to install replacement stubs
        for httplib methods which record interactions with remote servers, and then
        play them back. Because urllib depends on httplib functionality, replaylib
        will record and play back urllib interactions as well.
        
        It is intended to allow streamlined tests for services which interact with
        remote services: e.g. payment processors, shipping APIs, etc. To use it, just:
        
        1. Run your test suite while recording with replaylib.
        2. On subsequent runs, play back from replaylib. Tests will run faster, and
        won't require external services.
        
        It is fully tested, with 100% line and branch coverage, and works well with all
        APIs we have tried it on "in the wild".
        
        *Note* Use at your own risk!
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Simple as::
        
        $ easy_install replaylib
        
        Or if you prefer, download the source and then::
        
        $ python setup.py build
        $ python setup.py install
        
        Example
        =======
        
        >>> import replaylib
        >>> import urllib
        
        >>> replaylib.start_record()
        # Do some stuff with urllib.
        >>> urllib.urlopen('http://www.google.com')
        >>> replaylib.stop_record('activity.pkl')
        
        >>> replaylib.start_playback('activity.pkl')
        # Won't actually make a request to google.com
        >>> urllib.urlopen('http://www.google.com')
        >>> replaylib.stop_playback()
        
        Nose Plugin
        ===========
        
        ReplayLib also comes with a nose plugin to make recording and playing back the
        interactions used by your test suites even simpler::
        
        $ nosetests --replaylib-record=test.pkl
        $ nosetests --replaylib-playback=test.pkl
