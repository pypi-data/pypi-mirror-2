        The Networkcache HTTP Server are sub-divided into two Web services:

        ----------------
        
         * Incompatible change: NetworkcacheClient.download returns opened temporary
           file object, which will be deleted on close. This minimises memory footprint.
           [Lucas Carvalho]
         * Minimise memory footprint during upload. [≈Åukasz Nowak]
         * Use PUT instead of POST during upload. [Lucas Carvalho]
