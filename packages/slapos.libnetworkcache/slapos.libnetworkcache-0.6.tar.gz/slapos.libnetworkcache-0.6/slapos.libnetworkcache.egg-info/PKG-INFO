        ============
        The goal of libnetworkcache python library is to abstract the HTTP calls.
        It works as wrapper of python httplib to use the Networkcache HTTP Server.
        
        The Networkcache HTTP Server are sub-divided into two Web services:
          - SHACACHE
          - SHADIR
        
        SHACACHE

        SHADIR
        ======
        It is a simple HTTP Server used to cache information, working like a directory.
