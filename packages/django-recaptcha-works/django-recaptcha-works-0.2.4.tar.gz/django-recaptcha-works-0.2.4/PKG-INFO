Description: 
        *django-recaptcha-works* provides a Django form field that integrates the
        reCaptcha service. It is released under the terms of the BSD License.
        
        This reCaptcha implementation has no extra requirements other than Django.
        
        The app is based on the code `snippet 1644 <http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1644/>`_
        as published by *Chris Beaven* (aka SmileyChris).
        
        The original code has been further modified by *George Notaras* in order to
        implement the following:
        
        - transform the snippet to a Django application release
        - add SSL support for both the captcha presentation and the communication with the reCaptcha servers 
        - migration to the Google-hosted reCaptcha API
        - extension of the available application settings
        - addition of a decorator that adds the remote IP to the submitted form
        
        More information about the installation, configuration and usage of this app
        can be found in the **README** file inside the distribution package or in the
        project's `wiki <http://www.codetrax.org/projects/django-recaptcha-works/wiki>`_.
