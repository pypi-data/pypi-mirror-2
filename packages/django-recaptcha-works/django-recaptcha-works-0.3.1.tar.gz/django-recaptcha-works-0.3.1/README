django-recaptcha-works README
========================================================================
django-recaptcha-works provides a Django form field that integrates the
reCaptcha service. It is released under the terms of the BSD License.

This reCaptcha implementation has no extra requirements other than Django.

The app is based on the code snippet #1644 as published by Chris Beaven
(aka SmileyChris) on:
  - http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1644/

The original code has been further modified by George Notaras in order to
implement the following:

- transform the snippet to a Django application release
- add SSL support for both the captcha presentation and the communication
  with the reCaptcha servers 
- migration to the Google-hosted reCaptcha API
- extension of the available application settings
- addition of a decorator that adds the remote IP to the submitted form

How to read the HELP document
========================================================================
The HELP document is written in reStructuredText (rst). Although
reStructuredText is an easy-to-read plain text markup format, it is
recommended to convert it to HTML for a better reading experience.

In order to convert this document to HTML you need `docutils`, which
you can install in your system using `pip`::

    pip install docutils

Or `easy_install`:

    easy_install docutils

Once `docutils` is installed, you can use the `rst2html.py` utility to
perform the conversion:

    rst2html.py HELP help.html

Then use any web browser to view the exported `help.html` file.
