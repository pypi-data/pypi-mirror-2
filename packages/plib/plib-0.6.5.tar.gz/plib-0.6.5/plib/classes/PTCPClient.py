This module contains the PTCPClient class. This is a
blocking socket I/O client that connects to a server,
writes a given data string, and stores the server's
reply in self.read_data. The process_data method should
be overridden to do something with the returned data;
note that this method will be called from *inside* the
client_communicate method, and when it is finished, the
read data will be cleared.
