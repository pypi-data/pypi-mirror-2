Sub-Package STDLIB of Package PLIB -- Python Standard Library Extensions
Copyright (C) 2008-2010 by Peter A. Donis

Released under the GNU General Public License, Version 2
See the LICENSE and README files for more information

This sub-package contains classes and functions which extend or
modify the Python standard library.

Note that, as with the PLIB.CLASSES sub-package, the ModuleProxy
class from the PLIB.UTILS sub-package is used to put the sub-modules
of this package in the package namespace, so that you can write,
for example,

    from plib.stdlib import abstractcontainer

instead of having to write

    from plib.stdlib.abstractcontainer import abstractcontainer

See the PLIB.CLASSES sub-package docstring and comments for more details.

This file itself currently includes:

variables pythonpath, plibpath, binpath, sharepath --
    contain pathnames to root python directory, plib directory,
    third-party binary directory, and third-party shared data directory
    (the latter two are where plib's scripts and example programs will
    have been installed)

functions any, all -- a little different from the functions built in
    to Python 2.5, these allow an optional predicate

function closure -- similar to functools.partial from Python 2.5; returns
    a callable object that returns the same result as calling the passed
    function with the passed arguments (but does not allow additional
    arguments with the actual call, as functools.partial does)

function dotted_import -- wraps the __import__ builtin so that it
    returns the 'innermost' module in a dotted name; the equivalent
    of 'import x.y.z'

function dotted_from_import -- dotted_import, plus a getattr call to
    retrieve the named attribute from the dotted module; the equivalent
    of 'from x.y.z import a' (except that module a of package x.y.z
    will not be returned unless it has already been imported into the
    namespace of x.y.z)

function first -- returns first item in iterable, or default if empty.

function gcd -- fast implementation of Euclid's GCD algorithm.

function inrange -- returns index forced to be >= low, <= high.

function inverted -- returns the inverse of a mapping.

function iterfile --

Returns a generator that can be used in place of "for line in file"
in cases (such as when stdin is the file) where Python's line buffering
might mean the program doesn't get the lines one at a time as they come,
but in bunches. See

http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FileIteratorProblems

for a discussion of this issue and the code for this function that
fixes it. Note that the issue can also arise, as the blog entry notes,
with line-oriented network protocols, which means any time you are
using a "file-like object" derived from a socket.

function last -- returns last item in iterable, or default if empty.

function lcm -- fast implementation of LCM based on GCD above.

function normalize -- returns index with negative values normalized
    relative to count.

function normalize_slice -- returns a list of indexes "covered" by a
    slice (normalized relative to count), or an integer giving the
    index to which a zero-length slice refers (normalized relative
    to count).

function prod -- returns the product of all items in an iterable.

function slice_len -- returns the "length" of a slice (meaning the
    number of indexes that would be affected if it were used as an
    index into a sequence).

function sorted -- backports the builtin to Python versions < 2.4. No
    reverse functionality for earlier versions.

functions strtobool, strtodate -- self-explanatory.

function cached_property (and auxiliary class CachedProperty) --

Implementation of a "cached property" descriptor, which
does the following: on first access, it does a (presumably
expensive) calculation to determine the property's value,
and then "caches" the value in the instance as a plain
attribute, so further lookups will get the attribute
directly without the function call overhead of the
descriptor. Note that this means this must be a non-data
descriptor (because data descriptors, such as properties,
can't be masked by an ordinary instance attribute). This
also means, of course, that the "cached property" should
never be written to (it can be, but doing so wipes out
the cached value with no way of recovering it).

Note: the functionality has been split between a descriptor
class and a public decorator-usable function, but that is
not strictly necessary (since classes can be used as
decorators). Splitting it this way allows for a use case
where the class is called directly and the property name is
supplied explicitly (in which case there is no need for the
class to be cluttered with code to magically extract the
name from the fget function).

Also note that, unlike the standard property function, there
would be no real benefit in implementing cached_property in
a C extension module; the main reason for doing that would
be speed, but since the whole point is to eliminate the
overhead of the property altogether after the first access,
the additional overhead of a Python class instance is
negligible compared to the (presumably expensive) initial
calculation of the property value.
