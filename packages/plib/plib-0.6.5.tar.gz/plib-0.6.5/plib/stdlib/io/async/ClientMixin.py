    """
    Mixin class for async clients; writes data first, then
    reads back the response. Expects a class earlier in the
    MRO to implement the ``handle_read``, ``handle_write``,
    ``read_complete``, and ``write_complete`` methods. Call
    ``client_communicate`` to start the round-trip data
    exchange. Override ``process_data`` to do something with
    the server's reply. Override ``query_done`` if more than
    one round-trip data exchange is desired before closing
    the connection.
    
    Note that this class assumes that it is the "master" async
    communicator class, meaning it is responsible for calling its
    do_loop method to run the async polling loop. For "clients"
    which may not be the "master" communicators, you can either
    call the ``start`` and ``setup_client`` methods explicitly
    (which are sufficient to make the client respond to async
    polling events) or use the ``PersistentMixin`` class instead.
