This module contains the base class for asynchronous I/O
functionality. The idea is the same as the asyncore module
in the Python standard library, but the core is abstracted
out so it can be used with various I/O types, not just
network sockets.

There is also a modified asynchronous loop function that
allows a callback on every iteration, which is useful if a
separate event loop needs to be kept running in parallel
with the async loop (for example, a GUI event loop).

    Base class that abstracts out the core functionality
    for asynchronous I/O. Can be used to wrap any object
    that has a Unix file descriptor; the ``set_fileobj``
    method must be called with the object to be wrapped.
    Note that this class does *not* set file descriptors
    to non-blocking mode; that can't be reliably done
    here because there are too many different types of
    descriptors. Thus, users of this class must first set
    their file descriptors to non-blocking mode before
    calling the ``set_fileobj`` method.
    
    This class also allows a callback function on
    each iteration of the polling loop. This allows other
    processing to be done while waiting for I/O (one
    common use case would be keeping a GUI event loop
    running concurrently with the network polling loop).
