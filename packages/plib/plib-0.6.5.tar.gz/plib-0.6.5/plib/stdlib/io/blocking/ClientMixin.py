    Simple blocking I/O client: writes ``write_data``, then
    reads back ``read_data``, processes the read data, then
    clears data and closes. Call the ``client_communicate``
    method to run one "pass" of the write/read/process data
    loop. Override ``process_data`` to do something with the
    server's reply; override ``query_done`` if more than one
    round-trip data exchange is desired.

        it should either call the ``start`` method to supply
        more data to be written, or ensure that ``write_complete``
        is ``True``; otherwise the client will block forever in
        the ``while not self.write_complete()`` loop.
        
        Also note that if ``client_id is None``, we assume that
        the client is already connected to the server and don't
