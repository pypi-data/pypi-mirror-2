forking servers to respond to SIGCHLD by reaping any
child processes that have completed.

    Mixin class for forking servers to collect children when they
    exit instead of waiting for the next request. Note that since this
    class overrides ``collect_children``, it must be before the forking
    server class in the list of bases.
    
    Note that this implementation is compatible with the server
    classes in the Python standard library as well, so it can be used
    as a mixin with those classes if desired. In this case, the
    ``collect_on_signal`` flag should stay ``True``, so the SIGCHLD handler
    will reap children directly (and the ``child_waiting`` flag will not
    be used--it is mainly for mixing in with our ``SocketServer``).
