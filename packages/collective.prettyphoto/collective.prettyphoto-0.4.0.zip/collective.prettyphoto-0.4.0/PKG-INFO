        `collective.prettyphoto` integrates prettyPhoto 2.5.6 into Plone.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.5 and 4.0b5).
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.prettyphoto is even simpler. You can install
        collective.prettyphoto by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = collective.prettyphoto
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
