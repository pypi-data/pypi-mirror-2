Introduction
============

prettyPhoto is a jQuery based lightbox clone. Not only does it support images, it also add support for videos, flash, YouTube, iFrames. It's a full blown media lightbox. The setup is easy and quick, plus the script is compatible in every major browser.

The original implementation can be found here: http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/

This plugin has been tested and is known to work in the following browsers

* Firefox 2.0+

* Safari 3.1.1+

* Opera 9+

* Internet Explorer 6.0+

`collective.prettyphoto` integrates prettyPhoto 2.5.6 into Plone.

Installing
==========

This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.5 and 4.0b5).

Installing without buildout
---------------------------

Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
via the setup.py script.

Installing with buildout
------------------------

If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
collective.prettyphoto is even simpler. You can install
collective.prettyphoto by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::

    [instance]
    eggs = collective.prettyphoto

After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
will take care of updating your system.
