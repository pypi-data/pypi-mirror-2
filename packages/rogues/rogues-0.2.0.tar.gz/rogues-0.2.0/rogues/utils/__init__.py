"""
The "utils" module is a reimplmentation of a few of Nick Higham's "Matrix
Computation Toolbox" [1], into Python, Numpy, and Scipy.  They were
generally ported using the iPython shell and probably work best there.
They were developed from version 1.2 (released on 5-Sep-2002 and downloaded
17 Feb 2009.

Also included in this package some are the generic matrix manipulation
functions that were inclued in Version 3, (1995 downloaded Feb 2009)
of Test Matrix package [2]
