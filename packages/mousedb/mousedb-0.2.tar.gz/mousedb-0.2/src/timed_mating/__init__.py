"""This package defines the timed_mating app.

Timed matings are a specific type of breeding set.  
Generally, for these experiments a mating cage is set up and pregnancy is defined by a plug event.  
Based on this information, the age of an embryo can be estimated.  
When a breeding cage is defined, one option is to set this cage as a timed mating cage (ie Timed_Mating=True).  
If this is the case, then a plug event can be registered and recorded for this mating set.  
If the mother gives birth then this cage is implicitly set as a normal breeding cage."""
