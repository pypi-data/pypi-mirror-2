        ======================
        Null Payment Processor
        ======================
        
        This is a payment processor for getpaid, which doesn't actually
        process any payments. Its sole purpose is for testing other parts
        of getpaid, without the hassle of setting up a merchant/dev account
        with one of getpaid's supported payment processors.
