Flask-ZODB
==========

.. module:: flaskext.zodb

An object database for your Flask application.

Features
--------

Flask-ZODB inherits these features from the ZODB:

* Transparent persistence of arbitrary Python objects.  The only
  requirement is that the objects are "pickleable", which is true for most
  objects that represent data and are not dependent on external resources
  such as a file descriptor.  Any object can also be *made* pickleable as
  per the `pickle protocol`_.

  This feature also means you can save deeply nested datastructures and
  that references between objects are handled correctly.  That is: if you
  reference the same object in more than one place, the references will
  continue to reference the same object until you say otherwise.  This
  means you can associate a blog post with a user object directly rather
  than indirectly by say a user ID or the username as a string, and it Just
  Worksâ„¢ even after the user changes their account data, for example.

  .. _pickle protocol: http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html#the-pickle-protocol

* Scalability through support for multiprocess deployments and selective
  reading and writing of data.  Whereas with the pickle module you would
  normally read and write all data every time the ZODB only writes new and
  changed data and lazily reads data on demand as you try to access it.

* ACID_ properties ensuring reliable operations and integrity of data.

  .. _ACID: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID

In addition the extension offers these features itself:

* On-demand connection management.  If you don't use the ZODB during a
  request, it is never connected.  If you do use it, it connects
  automatically and consequentially disconnects at the end of the request.

* Automatic transaction management.  The automatic connections also act as
  transactions that gets committed unless there was an error in which case
  the transaction is rolled back.

* Clean API and code conforming to best practices for Flask extensions.

* 100% test coverage.  While coverage is a weak measurement of test
  quality, it is at least a starting point.


Installation
------------

Just pip it from the PyPI_, or include it as a dependency for your
application:

.. sourcecode:: console

  $ pip install Flask-ZODB

Development takes place on GitHub_ where you can also report any bugs you
find.

Setting it Up
-------------

First, let's stub a basic Flask application::

  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

To set it up for using Flask-ZODB, we need to configure a storage and then
create an extension object for ZODB which will also initiate the Flask
application for handling ZODB connections::

  app.config['ZODB_STORAGE'] = 'file://app.fs'

  from flaskext.zodb import ZODB
  db = ZODB(app)

The above uses a filestorage called :file:`app.fs`, located relative to the
working directory -- this is rarely what you want in practice but is good
enough for demonstrative purposes and maybe for development.


Using the ZODB from a Flask View
--------------------------------

This `db` object we set up functions like a normal Python dict that is
persistent between requests and server restarts, independent of the user
session and can be set up to propagate between multiple processes or over a
network.  Requests in Flask are treated as a transaction that is committed
if there was no exception raised.

::

  from flask import request, redirect, render_template

  @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def index():
      if request.method == 'POST':
          db['shoutout'] = request.form['message']
          return redirect('index')
      else:
          message = db.get('shoutout', 'Be the first to shout!')
          return render_template('index.html', message=message)

The template might look something like this:

.. sourcecode:: html+jinja

  <h1>{{ message }}</h1>

  <form action="{{ url_for('index') }}" method=POST>
    <input name=message>
    <button type=submit>Post!</button>
  </form>


Connecting from Outside Requests
--------------------------------

All you need to do is set up a test request context for your Flask
application and the ZODB object will be able to connect, and commit when
the request context is "popped":

::

  with app.test_request_context():
      db['shoutout'] = 'Developer was here!'

This can be useful in unit tests or from an interactive shell, or perhaps
in a Flask-Script_ command.  Typically a test request context is already
set up in these cases and you can just use `db` directly.

Gotcha: Mutating Persisted Objects
----------------------------------

If you save a mutable object in the ZODB and later mutate it, ZODB will not
be able to detect this and it won't be saved!  This is because ZODB tries
hard to avoid needless reading and writing and will only write *new*
objects.  You can tell ZODB that an object was changed by setting the
``_p_changed`` attribute to be true, or you can use the data types shipped
with ZODB that handles this for you.

::

  from flaskext.zodb import Object, List

  class User(Object):

      def __init__(self, name, password):
          self.name = name
          self.password = password
          self.shoutouts = List()


API Reference
-------------

.. describe:: ZODB_STORAGE

  Flask configuration option which must be set to one of:

  * A URI string supported by zodburi_
  * A tuple ``(storage_factory, db_keyword_args)``
  * A callable ``storage_factory``

Persistent Objects
""""""""""""""""""

This module exports some shorthand aliases for the persistent types and
balanced trees commonly used with ZODB.

.. class:: Object

  Alias of :class:`persistent.Persistent`.  Use this as the base class for
  your plain objects instead of :func:`object`, if you intend to save
  the object in ZODB.  This way changes to existing objects are detected
  and saved automatically.

.. class:: List

  Alias of :class:`persistent.list.PersistentList`.  Use this instead of
  :func:`list` for lists that you save in ZODB and changes to it will be
  detected and saved automatically.  Not necessary if you won't be changing
  the list after it is saved.

.. class:: Dict

  Alias of :class:`persistent.mapping.PersistentMapping`.  Use this
  instead of :func:`dict` for mappings that you save in ZODB and that you
  might want to make changes to later.  This way those changes will
  automatically be detected and saved.

.. class:: BTree

  Alias of :class:`BTrees.OOBTree.OOBTree`.  Behaves mostly like
  :class:`Dict` but requires that the keys are orderable and performs
  better on large mappings.  Whereas a :class:`Dict` is fully loaded in
  memory every time it is read, a BTree mapping only loads the items that
  you try to read.
