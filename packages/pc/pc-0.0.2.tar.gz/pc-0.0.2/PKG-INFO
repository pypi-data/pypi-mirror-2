Description: Design goals:
        
          * Easy to fork-exec commands, wait or no wait
          * Easy to capture stdout/stderr of children (command substitution)
          * Easy to express I/O redirections
          * Easy to construct pipelines
          * Use short names for easy interactive typing
        
        In effect, make Python a sane alternative to non-trivial shell scripts.
        
        Technically, pc.py is a layer on top of subprocess. The subprocess
        module support a rich API but is clumsy for many common use cases,
        namely sync/async fork-exec, command substitution and pipelining,
        all of which is trivial to do on system shells.
        
        Documentation is at <http://github.com/aht/pc.py/>.
        
        This module depends on Python 2.6, or where subprocess is available.
        Doctests require /bin/sh to pass. Tested on Linux.
        
        This is an alpha release. Some features are unimplemented. Expect bugs.
