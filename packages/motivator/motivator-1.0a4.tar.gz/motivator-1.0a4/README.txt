Motivator
=========

Motivator is a simple command-line app to speak a particular phrase at
the specified interval. Both the phrase and text are currently hardcoded
for my own purposes, but I may extend it in future.

Requires PyWin32 (Windows) and appscript (MacOSX) to control iTunes volume.
iTunes may have to be installed.
