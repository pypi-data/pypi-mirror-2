# a simple example illustrating piecewise linear
# constraints on the value of a variable X.
#
# the minimal objective function value is obtained
# with x=0. because there is a single breakpoint,
# the fixed point (where y=0) is assumed to be
# (0,0) - by adding the keyword "offset=y", this
# can be changed to (0,y). Thus, the optimal
# objective function value at x=0 is 0!
