Changelog
=========

1.2b3 - 2010-06-13
------------------

- Moved ZCML registrations out of functional tests into a layer. This allows
  them to be torn-down correctly and avoids any registrations to end up in the
  local component registry.
  [hannosch]

- Move tests into tests sub-package and avoid some magic.

1.1.2 - 2008-07-10
------------------

- Fixed a deprecation warning by using reg.factory instead of reg.value.
  [davisagli]

- Changed encoding of view registration requirements again, in order to
  properly support portlet renderer templates and fix issue #8275 which
  broke customerize in most cases.  Now *all* the requirements are used.
  [davisagli]

1.1.1 - 2008-07-07
------------------

- Re-enable browsertest introduced in r12928 after David's fix for the
  long-standing security issue (see #6196 and #8154)
  [witsch]

- Fixed request type lookup to use the second requirement for a view
  registration rather than the last.  This making it possible to
  customerize viewlet and portlet templates registered with the same
  name for multiple z3 browser layers.  See test introduced in r21154.
