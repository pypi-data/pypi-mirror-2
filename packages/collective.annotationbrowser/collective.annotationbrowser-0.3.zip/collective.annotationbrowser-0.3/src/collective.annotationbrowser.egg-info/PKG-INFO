Description: collective.annotationbrowser
        ============================
        
        This package allows to browse zope.annotation based items. Package provides
        "ann_view" browser view which lists all available (and allowed) annotation
        keys and their values.
        
        By default, all annotation keys are shown. It is possible to define blacklist
        and whitelist. Go to /Plone Site/manage_propertiesForm and add
        'annbrowser.blacklist' and/or 'annbrowser.whitelist' properties (type: list).
        If no whitelist is defined, .* is used. There is no blacklist by default.
        
        Annotation editor
        -----------------
        
        Page /ann_edit allows site manager to edit basic annotation values (strings,
        integers and floats currently).
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3 - 2010/11/04
        ----------------
        
        - fixed display of Image annotations
        
        0.2 - 2010/08/24
        ----------------
        
        - added ++annotation++KEYNAME view - allows to display required key directly
        and without length limitations. pprint is used for rendering the key
        content. The traverser idea and code is stolen from
        archetypes.fieldtraverser.
        
        - added ann_remove?keyname=KEYNAME view - immediately removes the key
        
        - added links to ++annotation++ traverser and to ann_remove view to ann_view
        page so it is really easy to accidentaly remove any annotation key.
