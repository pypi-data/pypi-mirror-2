Changelog
=========

0.3 - 2010/11/04
----------------

- fixed display of Image annotations

0.2 - 2010/08/24
----------------

- added ++annotation++KEYNAME view - allows to display required key directly
  and without length limitations. pprint is used for rendering the key
  content. The traverser idea and code is stolen from
  archetypes.fieldtraverser.

- added ann_remove?keyname=KEYNAME view - immediately removes the key

- added links to ++annotation++ traverser and to ann_remove view to ann_view
  page so it is really easy to accidentaly remove any annotation key.
