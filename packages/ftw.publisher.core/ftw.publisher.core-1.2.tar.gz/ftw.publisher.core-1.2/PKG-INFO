Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The `ftw.publisher` packages provide tools for publishing plone contents from
        one instance to another.
        
        This package provides shared tools and utils used by `ftw.publisher.sender` and
        `ftw.publisher.receiver`.

        =====
        
        The main project package is `ftw.publisher.sender` since it contains all the
        configuration panels and the most tools - but without the other mandatory
        packages it will not work.
