0.4.0 (2010-10-05)
------------------

- Added undeclared but necessary install dependency on `zope.app.http`.

0.3.0 (2010-10-05)
------------------

- Added not declared test dependencies.

- Updated test set up and fixed tests to run with ZTK 1.0.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.


0.2.5 (2008-09-16)
------------------

- Bug/Misfeature: Finally get handling of URL merging working as desired. Also
  added extensive tests to document the behavior.


0.2.4 (2008-09-04)
------------------

- RESTClient() now correctly interprets `https://` URLs.


0.2.3 (2008-03-20)
------------------

- Bug/Misfeature: Sigh, getting the trailing slash handled correctly turned
  out to be a big pain. I really hope I got it working the way it should be
  for a REST client now.


0.2.2 (2008-03-19)
------------------

- Bug/Misfeature: The client always added a slash to the end of the URL. But
  some REST APIs are very sensitive to this. Now the slash is only preserved
  if present, but nothing will be added otherwise.


0.2.1 (2008-03-06)
------------------

- Bug: Sometimes the response body was not read and the contents of the client
  was empty. Unfortunately, this problem could not be reliably reproduced, but
  debugging showed that the connection was closed to early. (Roy Mathew)

- Feature: Make the package Python 2.4 and 2.5 compatible.

- Feature: Require lxml 2.0 for z3c.rest.


0.2.0 (2008-03-03)
------------------

- Feature: Made the HTTP caller pluggable for the REST client, allowing
  request types other than ``RESTRequest``.


0.1.0 (2008-03-03)
------------------

  * Publisher hooks to build dedicated REST servers

  * Error view support

  * Pluggable REST traverser based on `z3c.traverser`
