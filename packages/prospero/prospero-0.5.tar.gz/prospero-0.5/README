Overview

Prospero is a datastore which addresses content using a RESTful interface. 
It aims to provide a system which is proportionally complex (simplicity).


Example

Here's an example retrieving data from Prospero

>>> from restclient import GET
>>>
>>> url = "http://localhost:9998/database/test_database/collection/test_collection/doc/"
>>> 
>>> result = GET(url, params = {}, accept = ["application/json"],async = False )

Here's an example saving data to a Prospero server

>>> from restclient import POST
>>>
>>> data = {u"foo" : u"bar"}
>>> file_data = {'docs' : {"file":json.dumps(data),"filename":"docs"}}
>>>
>>> url = "http://localhost:9998/database/test_database/collection/test_collection/"
>>> 
>>> result = POST(url, files = file_data, accept = ["application/json"],async = False )

Simple!
