Description

Pickled Data Object (pkldo) is method #470 for saving Python data to a
file.  It provides functionality for create, retrieve, update, and
delete operations and uses Python's built-in Pickle routines.  It also
performs operations atomically and offers file integrity.  Its best
fit is for applications with basic data persistence needs.

* Tested on BSD and Linux.
* Windows compatibility will be next.
* Documentation in progress.

    >>> import pkldo
    >>> class Test(pkldo.Pdo):
    ...     pass
    ... 
    >>> a = Test()
    >>> a.some_data = "howdy"
    >>> a.create_pdo('/tmp/some_file')
    >>> b = Test()
    >>> b.load_pdo('/tmp/some_file')
    >>> b.some_data
    'howdy'
    >>> b.some_data = "hmmmm"
    >>> b.save_pdo()
    >>> c = Test()
    >>> c.load_pdo('/tmp/some_file')
