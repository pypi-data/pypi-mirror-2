Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product was created to help you remove nasty local persistent
        utilities  that won't go away and cab destroy your instance when
        you try to remove a product that registered one.
        
        Features
        --------
        
         - remove adapters
         - remove subscribers
         - remove provided interfaces
         - remove LinguaPlone left-over ugliness
         - remove provided interfaces across the entire site
           - useful for removing collective.flowplayer
        
        Just append '/@@fix-persistent-utilities' onto your plone site root
        or the root of zope(for gsm) and browse through all your registered
        utilities on your site and remove things at will.
        
        By default, the tools prevents you from removing certain 
        registrations; however, you can enter "expert mode" and remove 
        whatever you want.
        
        
        
        
        WARNING!!!
        ----------
        
        You can really screw up things if you do this wrong so use with
        extreme care and backup your instance before you use it.
        
        I will not take responsibility if you misuse this tool...
        
        
        Advice
        ------
        
        Do not include this product as part of your normal set of
        products. Only install this product on debug zope clients.
        
        Also, to actually fix a product, you need to actually have the product
        installed while removing it.
