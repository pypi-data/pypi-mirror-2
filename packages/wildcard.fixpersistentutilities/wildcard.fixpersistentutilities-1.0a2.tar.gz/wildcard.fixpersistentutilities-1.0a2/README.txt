Introduction
============

This product was created to help you remove nasty local persistent utilities that won't go away
and cab destroy your instance when you try to remove a product that registered one.

Just append '/@@fix-persistent-utilities' onto your plone site root and browse through all your
registered utilities on your site and remove things at will.

By default, the tools prevents you from removing certain registrations; however, you can enter
"expert mode" and remove whatever you want.


WARNING!!!
----------

You can really screw up things if you do this wrong so use with extreme care and backup your instance
before you use it.

I will not take responsibility if you misuse this tool...
