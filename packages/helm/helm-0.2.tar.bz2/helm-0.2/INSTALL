Requirements
------------

 * python >= 2.6 (and < 3.0) [http://python.org/download/releases/]
 * python-cairo >= 1.8.8 [http://cairographics.org/pycairo/]
 * python-gtk2 >= 2.17 [http://pygtk.org/]
 * python-imaging >= 1.1.7 [http://pythonware.com/products/pil/]
 * python-xlib >= 0.14 [http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/]


Installation (as user)
----------------------

 $ ./setup.py install --prefix=~/.local

This will install Helm under your ~/.local directory or in any other
directory you want.

$chosen_directory/bin must be in $PATH for the shell to find the "helm" command.

$chosen_directory/lib/python$x.$y/site-packages must be in sys.path for Python
to find the "helm" module (starting with PythonÂ 2.6,
~/.local/lib/python$x.$y/site-packages is added to sys.path automatically;
see PEP 370 for more info).

$chosen_directory/etc/xdg must be in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS for Helm to find the
default config file.


Installation (as root)
----------------------

 # ./setup.py install

The default target directory is /usr/local. You can override it with
prefix=/my/precious/path:

 # ./setup.py install --prefix=/usr


Uninstallation
--------------

This fucking Distutils does not let us uninstall yet so you have to remove
files manually. :/


Getting help
------------

$ ./setup.py --help
