DESCRIPTION
===========

The ClusterShell library obtains node groups configuration options from the
system-wide configuration file */etc/clustershell/groups.conf*.

The configuration file has a format in the style of RFC 822 composed
of several sections which may be present in any order. Sections are:

Main
  General options definition
*Group_source*
  External commands definition for group source *Group_source* (map, all, list and reverse)


[Main]
------
Configuration parameters of the ``Main`` section are described below.

default
  Specify the default group source used by the NodeSet parser when the
  user does not specify explicitly the group source (eg. "@io").

*Group_source*
-----------------
Configuration parameters of each group source section are described below.

map
  Specify the external shell command used to resolve a group name into a
  nodeset, list of nodes or list of nodeset (separated by space characters or
  by carriage returns). The variable *$GROUP* is replaced before executing the
  command.
all
  Optional external shell command that should return a nodeset, list of
  nodes or list of nodeset of all nodes for this group source. If not
  specified, the library will try to resolve all nodes by using the ``list``
  external command in the same group source followed by ``map`` for each group.
list
  Optional external shell command that should return the list of all groups
  for this group source (separated by space characters or by carriage
  returns).
reverse
  Optional external shell command used to find the group(s) of a single
  node. The variable $NODE is previously replaced. If this upcall is not
  specified, the reverse operation is computed in memory by the library from
  the *list* and *map* external calls. Also, if the number of nodes to
  reverse is greater than the number of available groups, the *reverse*
  external command is avoided automatically.

Each external command might return a non-zero return code when the operation
is not doable. But if the call return zero, for instance, for a non-existing
group, the user will not receive any error when trying to resolve such unknown
group.  The desired behaviour is up to the system administrator.


RESOURCE USAGE
==============

All external command results are cached in memory to avoid multiple calls.


EXAMPLES
========

Simple configuration file for local groups and slurm partitions binding.

*groups.conf*
-------------

| [Main]
| default: local
| 
| [local]
| map:  awk -F: '/^$GROUP:/ {print $2}' /etc/clustershell/groups
| list: awk -F: '/^\w/ {print $1}' /etc/clustershell/groups
| 
| [slurm]
| map: sinfo -h -o "%N" -p $GROUP
| all: sinfo -h -o "%N"
| list: sinfo -h -o "%P"
| reverse: sinfo -h -N -o "%P" -n $NODE
