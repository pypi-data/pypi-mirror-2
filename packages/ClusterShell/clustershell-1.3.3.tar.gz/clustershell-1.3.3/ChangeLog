	'stdout_msgtree" and 'stderr_msgtree' Task default keywords, useful if we
	don't want MsgTree internal buffering for fully event-based scripts (eg.
	clush without -b). When disabled, any Task method accessing MsgTree data

	buffers by nodes or nodeset length like clubak (fix trac ticket #54).

2010-02-11 S. Thiell <stephane.thiell@cea.fr>
	
	* Version 1.2 beta 3 released.

	* scripts/clush.py: For clush --copy, when --dest is not specified, set

	path.

	* scripts/clush.py: Added option --nostdin to prevent reading from
	standard input (fix trac ticket #49).

	* Engine/Factory.py: Disable Engine.EPoll automatic selection as an issue

	improvements.

	* scripts/clubak.py: Added clubak utility (trac ticket #47). It provides
	 dshbak backward-compatibility, but always try to sort buffers by nodes or
	 nodeset. It also provides additional -L option to switch to alternative
	 line mode display.

2010-02-09 S. Thiell <stephane.thiell@cea.fr>

	* Worker.py: Updated Task/MsgTree dependencies. Added iter_node_errors()
	method. Added match_keys optional parameter to iter_node_buffers() and
	iter_node_errors(). Added WorkerSimple.error() method (read stderr).
	Added tests.

	* Task.py: Updated MsgTree dependencies. Factorized most tree data's
	access methods.

	* MsgTree.py: Merged Msg and _MsgTreeElem in one class MsgTreeElem. All

	now always sorted by name/pattern (eg. acluster2, bcluster1).

	* scripts/clush.py: Fix stdout/stderr separation issue (introduced
	in 1.2b2) thanks to the new Task.set_default() method.

	* Task.py: As set_info() is now dispatched through the task special port,
	and applied only on task.resume() when called from another thread, add two
	new methods default() and set_default() to synchronously manage another
	task specific dictionary, useful for default configuration parameters.

2010-02-01 S. Thiell <stephane.thiell@cea.fr>

	* Version 1.2 beta 2 released.

	different tasks.
