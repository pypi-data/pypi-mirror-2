Changelog
=========

0.10 - 2010-04-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improve five.grok support [fretin]

- Check if templates are acquisition-aware before trying to wrap them. This
  fixes problems with METAL macros in some ZMI pages. [wichert]

0.9 - 2010-04-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Basic support for five.grok templates. [wichert]

0.8 - 2010-01-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed some calling convention oddity that would result in the view
  instance being passed doubly as the template arguments.

0.7 - 2009-05-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Default encoding of the base template set to UTF-8. [malthe]

- Update to latest Chameleon. [malthe]

- Patch ``macros`` attribute. [malthe]

0.6 - 2009-04-06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Avoid another case of unconditionally attempting to Acquisition wrap
  template files. We do have an interface check for this. [hannosch]

0.5 - 2009-02-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added test function to template context. [malthe]

- Fixed edge-case (special case?) where the view of a
  ViewPageTemplateFile is really only the view for a view. [malthe]

- Added patch for ``Products.PageTemplates.PageTemplateFile``. [malthe]

- Rework the "full namespace provided to path expression" change introduced
  in 0.3. We no longer call the expensive locals() function but construct a
  minimal namespace with the context and request ourselves. [hannosch]

- If the ``__get__`` method is called uninstantiated, just return the
  class itself. [malthe]

five.pt 0.4 (released 2/13/2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue where the ``template`` parameter to a viewlet manager
  directive was effectively ignored. [malthe]

- Fixed acquisition-wrapping issue with the (patched) bound template
  class (could cause infinite loop due to cyclic acquisition
  chain). [malthe]

- Moved evaluate_path and evaluate_exists over to ``z3c.pt``, adding
  support for global ``path()`` and ``exists()`` functions for use in
  ``python:`` expressions to it (LP #317967). [sidnei]

five.pt 0.3 (released 12/17/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use bobo traversal if ``OFS.interfaces.ITraversable`` interface is
  provided. [malthe]

- Adjusted the path expression to provide the full namespace to the render
  function and not just the request. This matches Zope2 behavior. [hannosch]

five.pt 0.2 (released 11/29/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- From Zope 2.12 onwards, do not acquisition-wrap content
  provider. [malthe]

- Split out CMF-related code to separate package. [malthe]

- Compatibility changes to support Zope 2.10. [malthe]

five.pt 0.1 (released 11/19/2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial release.

- Simplified template class inheritance. [malthe]

- Added ``path`` and ``exists`` functions to skin template
  namespace. [malthe]

  expressions. [malthe]

  view page template instances. [malthe]

- Made `EContext` class more robust. [malthe]

- Register custom file-system page template class for use with CMF
  form controllers. [malthe]

- Register custom file-system page template class for use with CMF
  directory views. [malthe]

  viewlet managers using Chameleon templates. [malthe]

- Updated to latest API. [malthe]

- Package structure. [hannosch]
