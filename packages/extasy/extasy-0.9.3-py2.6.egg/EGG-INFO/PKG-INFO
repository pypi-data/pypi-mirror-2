Description: EXTasy
        =======
        
        EXTasy is a Cucumber-like BDD tool for ExtJS developers. It is written in python and built on top of Pycukes.
        
        
        Installation
        =====
        
        You can install it using Python's easy_install::
        
            $ easy_install extasy
        
        Or You can download source code and install using setup.py script::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        First, make sure you have installed story_runner, pyhistorian, pycukes and extasy.
        By default, if you just call ``extasy`` from your command line into some dir, it will look for a ``stories`` dir (expecting your stories files are there).
        Each story file by convention ends with .story, like ``calculator.story``.
        
        So, lets say you have the directory tree::
        
         |-- calculator
            |-- stories
                |-- calculator.story
        
        
        To run your stories, you can simple call::
        
            $ extasy
        
        Or if you can specify exactly what stories run::
            
            $ extasy stories/calculator.story
