        ======
        
        Oraide is a tool to spare presenters the risky proposition of entering
        terminal commands and giving a presentation at the same time. Oraide replays
        presentation scripts composed of notes and terminal commands into a GNU Screen
        session. In addition to presentations, it's also useful for recording
        screencasts.
        
        The name *Oraide* is a portmanteau of *orate* and *aide*.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Before giving your presentation, prepare a script file. A script file looks
        like this::
        
        # connect to the remote server
        ssh host-name
        
        # create a new file
        echo 'Hello, World!' >> hello_world.txt
        
        # Read the file.
        # And by that I mean cat it.
        cat hello_world.txt
        
        # Background activity
        1: ssh host-name
        1: rm hello_world.txt
        
        Script files are interpreted by these rules:
        
        * Blank lines are ignored.
        
        * Lines starting with a hash are presenters notes. They're not executed.
        
        * All other lines are commands to be sent to the Screen session. If such a
        line starts with a number and a colon, the command is sent to the Screen
        window of the name number. Otherwise, the command is sent to window 0.
        
        Once you have a script ready, you can run Oraide. Running Oraide requires a
        script and a Screen session as command line arguments. Thus, run Oraide like
        To run the script against a specific Screen session like so: `oraide script
        session`, where `script` and `session` are the name of the Oraide script and
        Screen sessions respectively. For example, to run a script named `conference`
        on a Screen session named `demo`, enter `oraide conference demo`.
        
        So, a complete example would look something like this::
        
        $ screen -S demo
        # put that screen session on the projector
        # open a new terminal session on your laptop display
        $ oraide my_great_presentation demo
        Starting my_great_presentation. Press ENTER to advance script.
