        Introduction
        ============
        
        The package is meant to be used with the Plone3 theme collective.wowlichking,
        but it is not required.
        
        It includes a custom contenttype (wowcharacter) and a custom view (@@wowcharacter).
        
        wowcharacter
        ------------
        
        The contenttype represents a World of Warcraft character.
        When creating one, you need to state the Name and Realm of the character,
        also its fraction (Horde/Alliance) and its zone (EU/US).
        
        @@wowhcaracter
        --------------
        
        The view uses an API to communicate with the WoW-Armory to display additional
        information about the character, like class, guild, talent specs, professions, equip etc.
        It also implements the wowhead-Tooltip for showing a WoW-ingame-like tooltip when hovering 
        over the equip-icons.
