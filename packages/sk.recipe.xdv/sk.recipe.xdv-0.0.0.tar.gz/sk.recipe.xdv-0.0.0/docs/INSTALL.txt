Installation
============

Since this is a Buildout recipe, there's nothing really to install.  Just
mention the recipe name in a buildout and enjoy!  For example, your
``buildout.cfg`` might be something like this::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        my-webserver
        my-cms
        my-theme
        web-config
    ...
    [my-theme]
    recipe = sk.recipe.xdv
    rules = ${buildout:directory}/etc/rules.xml
    theme = ${buildout:directory}/src/skin/main-template.html
    [web-config]
    recipe = collective.recipe.template
    input = ${buildout:directory}/etc/httpd.conf.template
    output = ${buildout:directory}/etc/httpd.conf
    ...

Then, assuming ``httpd.conf.template`` contains ``${my-theme:output}``, the
generated ``httpd.conf`` will contain the path to the compiled XSLT file.

Easy!
