This is a Buildout_ recipe that automates compilation of XDV_ rules and theme
files into XSLT_ for use with transformation-capable web servers.


Introduction
============

Deliverance_ is a "game-changing" concept in the assembly and theming of
disparate web applications into singular, cohesive units.  XDV_ is an
implementation of a subset of Deliverance that generates pure Extensible
Stylesheet Language (XSL_) Transformation (XSLT_) rules.  Buildout_ is a
civilized way of constructing of applications in repeatable a manner, driven
by "recipes" that tell how to attain specific goals.

This recipe, ``sk.recipe.xdv``, enables a Buildout to automatically construct
the XSLT output of XDV from its source rules and theme.
