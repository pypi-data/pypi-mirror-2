js.jquery_expandbox
*******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery.expandBox`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery.expandBox`: http://projects.stephane-klein.info/jquery.expandBox/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_expandbox``) are published to some URL.
