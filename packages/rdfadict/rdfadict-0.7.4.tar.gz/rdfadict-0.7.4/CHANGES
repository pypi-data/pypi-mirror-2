Change History
**************

0.7.3 (2011-01-27)
==================

* Corrected minor bug; the Sets modules was imported in all cases,
  resulting in a DeprecationWarning.

0.7.1.1 (2010-03-17)
====================

* Added missing MANIFEST.in, which prevented setup.py from working
  when run from an sdist (as opposed to a checkout).

0.7.1 (2009-07-20)
==================

* Updated DictSetTripleSink to coerce ``triple()`` parameters to
  ``unicode`` instead of ``str``.

0.7 (2009-06-02)
================

* DictTripleSink uses ``encode`` instead of ``str``, making it
  friendlier to Unicode.
* Eliminated custom pyRDFa wrapper.
* Added a test for handling Unicode triples. 

0.6 (2008-10-14)
================

* Added DictSetTripleSink

0.5.2 (2008-08-14)
==================

* Corrected bug with parse_url; non-XHTML sources will now be parsed
  correctly.

0.5.1 (2008-08-13)
==================

* Added ``parse_file`` method for parsing data from a file-like
  object.
* ``parseurl`` and ``parsestring`` are now aliased to ``parse_url``
  and ``parse_string`` respectively.

0.5 (2008-08-12)
================

* rdfadict now acts as a wrapper for `pyRdfa
  <http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/>`_ for full compliance with the
  candidate recommendation.
* The ``cc`` namespace is no longer special cased with a default
  value.
* Removed tidy extra and uTidylib dependency; parsing is now handled
  by pyRdfa which uses html5lib for handling more broken HTML.
* Doctests are now in README.txt in the rdfadict package.
* The default XHTML namespace is now
  http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab instead of
  http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml

0.4.2 (2007-06-05)
==================

* Corrected dependency link for uTidylib.

0.4.1 (2007-03-21)
==================

* Use `uTidylib <http://utidylib.berlios.de>`_ instead of ``os.system`` for
  wrapping tidy.

0.4.0 (2007-03-20)
==================

* Provide rudimentary fallback to Tidy when we encounter HTML which is not
  well-formed XML.

0.3.3 (2007-03-14)
==================

* Removed special case for ``cc:license``; instead, ``cc`` namespace simply 
  has a default value of ``http://web.resource.org/cc/``.

0.3.2 (2007-03-12)
==================

* Ignore assertions which have unresolvable namespace prefixes.
* Special case handling for ``cc:license``.

0.3.1 (2007-03-09)
==================

* Fixed bug in subject resolution exception handling.

0.3 (2007-03-08)
================

* Fixed resolution of URIs v. CURIEs
* Drop assertions with non-namespaced CURIEs as the predicate (per updated spec)
* Updated test suite to comply with updated RDFa specification
* Corrected subject resolution behavior for <link> and <meta> elements
* Implemented entry point and extractor interface for compatibility with the
  ccrdf.rdfextract library.
* Fixed parsing of ``rev`` assertions, which was formerly completely broken.

0.2 (2006-11-21)
================

* Directly subclass list and dict for our sample triple sinks
* Additional package metadata for PyPI
* Additional documentation of sink interface and tests for the SimpleTripleSink

0.1 (2006-11-20)
================

* Initial public release
