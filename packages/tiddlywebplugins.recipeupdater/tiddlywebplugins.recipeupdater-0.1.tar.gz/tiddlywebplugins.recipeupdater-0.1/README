Update all the recipes that match a particular bag descriptor
with one or more bags that replace it. For example:

twanager recipeupdate '/bags/foobar/tiddlers?select=bang' \
    '/bags/foobar/tiddlers' '/bags/anotherbag/tiddlers?select=bag'

To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.recipeupdater' to twanager_plugins
in tiddlywebconfig.py

This is a limited functionality early release.
