Description: Library for creating scripts with sub-commands, and options from the command
        line, environment, and config files.
        This module is made up of two separate
        entities:
        
            * Config framework
            * Scripting framework
        
        Commands are specified which are essentially classes with a `__call__`
        defined, and registered with the script. A command specifies the options
        schema that it will have.
