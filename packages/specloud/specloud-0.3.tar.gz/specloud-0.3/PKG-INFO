Description: SpecLoud
        =========
        
        Use nosetests and plugins to take BDD specifications easier.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install specloud is using pip and requirements file::
        
        $ pip install --no-deps specloud -r http://github.com/hugobr/specloud/raw/master/requirements.txt
        
        
        Or you can try finding dependencies by yourself and installing specloud without requirements file.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Get a python file with BDD-style test names (starting with it, ensure, should, must) and add them to the test suite
        
        
        For example::
        
        $ cat example.py
        
        import unittest
        
        
        class CalculatorSpec(unittest.TestCase):
        
        def it_should_sum_integers(self):
        # ...
        pass
        
        def should_not_divide_by_zero(self):
        # ...
        pass
        
        def must_accept_floats(self):
        # ...
        pass
        
        def ensure_it_work_with_fractions(self):
        # ...
        pass
        
        def test_subtract_positive_from_negative_numbers(self):
        # ...
        pass
        
        
        The command line tool `specloud` colorizes **green** for tests with no failures and no errors and **red** for tests with failures and/or errors::
        
        $ specloud example.py
        
        Calculator spec
        - ensure it work with fractions
        - it should sum integers
        - must accept floats
        - should not divide by zero
        - subtract positive from negative numbers

        Old Name
        --------
        
        The project was born as a proof of concept and I named it firstly `pyunitbdd`. But that's a terrible name. So I renamed the project to `specloud`.
