Installation
============

This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.x).

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe
to manage your project, you can add ``collective.updatelinksoncopy``
to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.updatelinksoncopy

(If you are working with a version of Plone < 3.3 then you'll also
need to install a ZCML slug.)
