Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A drop in package for Plone that improves the copy and paste operation
        of folder structures. Reference fields (e.g. relatedItems) and UID
        inline links in text fields are rewritten if they reference any of the
        content within the folder structure being copied so that they now link
        to the copied content.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        the buildout in this package will create a test stub which can be run
        with::
        
        ./bin/test
        
        See the doctests for more information of what this package does.

        Installation
        ============
        
        This package requires Plone 3.x or later (tested on 3.3.x).
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe
        to manage your project, you can add ``collective.updatelinksoncopy``
        to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.updatelinksoncopy
        
        (If you are working with a version of Plone < 3.3 then you'll also
        need to install a ZCML slug.)
