Changes
=======

1.0.1 (2010-05-07)
------------------

- LP #142464:  remove double newline between log entries:  it makes doing
  smarter formatting harder.

- Updated tests to remove use of deprecated ``zope.testing.doctest``.


1.0.0 (2009-07-24)

* Fix test that incorrectly relied on the order of a list that was generated
  from a dict.

1.0a1 (2007-12-18)
------------------

* Initial release, branched from ZODB trunk on 2007-11-08 (aka
  "3.9.0dev").

* Remove (deprecated) support for beforeCommitHook alias to
  addBeforeCommitHook.

* Add weakset tests.

* Remove unit tests that depend on ZODB.tests.utils from
  test_transaction (these are actually integration tests).
