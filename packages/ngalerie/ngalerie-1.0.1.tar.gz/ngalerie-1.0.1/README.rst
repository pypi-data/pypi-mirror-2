========

NGalerie is a Python project that aim to enable fast management of
Reflex Camera pictures.

The picture are store in landscape way even if they shouldn't, there
is a miniature file inside that we could remove.

We also want to be able to resize them at a usable size, create
external thumbnails and give them a meaningful name such as the date
of picture's shots.

NGalerie is a CLI software with useful function to make it do what we
want.
