Description: Object-hash mapping library for Redis.
        ======================================
        
        Oredis is a library for storing objects in Redis, a persistent key-value database. It includes an extensible list of validations and has very good performance.
        
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
            from oredis.models import Model
            from oredis.manager import Manager
            from oredis.fields import String, PrimaryKey, StringPK, Integer, DateTime
        
            class NoteManager(Manager):
                pass
        
            class NoteModel(Model):
                id = PrimaryKey()
                title = String()
                pk_hash = StringPK()
                body = String(required = True)
        
                objects = NoteManager(connection = redis.Redis())
        
            In [19]: note1 = NoteModel(title = "Hello world!",
                ....: body="I am currently engaged in teaching my brother to program.
                He is a total beginner, but very smart. (And he actually wants to learn).
                I've noticed that some of our sessions have gotten bogged down in minor details,
                and I don't feel I've been very organized. (But the answers to this
                post have helped a lot.)")
        
             In [20]: note1
             Out[20]: <NoteModel: 942>
        
             In [21]: note1.title
             Out[21]: 'Hello world!'
        
             In [22]: note1.title
