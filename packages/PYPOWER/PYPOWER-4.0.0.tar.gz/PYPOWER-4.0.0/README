============
Introduction
============

PYPOWER is a power flow and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solver. It is a port of
MATPOWER_ by PSERC (Cornell) to the Python_ programming language. Current
features include:

* DC and AC (Newton's method & Fast Decoupled) power flow and
* DC and AC optimal power flow (OPF)

Installation
------------

PYPOWER depends upon:

* Python_ 2.5 or later and
* SciPy_ 0.7 or later.

It can be easy_installed using setuptools_::

  $ easy_install PYPOWER

Alternatively, `download http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PYPOWER#downloads`_ and
unpack the tarball and install::

  $ tar zxf PYPOWER-4.0.tar.gz
  $ python setup.py install

Using PYPOWER
-------------

Installing PYPOWER creates ``pf`` and ``opf`` commands. To list the command
options::

  $ pf -h

PYPOWER includes a selection of test cases. For example, to run a power flow
on the IEEE 14 bus test case::

  $ pf -c case14

Alternatively, the path to a PYPOWER case data file can be specified.::

  $ pf /path/to/case14.py

The ``opf`` command has the same calling syntax. For example, to solve an OPF
for the IEEE Reliability Test System and write the solved case to file::

  $ opf -c case24_ieee_rts --solvedcase=rtsout.py

For further information please refer to the http://www.pypower.org/ and the
`API documentation`_.
