    Constructs the parameters for linear "basin constraints" on C{Pg}, C{Qg}
    and C{Y} used by the CCV cost formulation, expressed as::

         Ay * x <= by

    where C{x} is the vector of optimization variables. The starting index
    within the C{x} vector for the active, reactive sources and the C{y}
    variables should be provided in arguments C{pgbas}, C{qgbas}, C{ybas}.
    The number of generators is C{ng}.

    Assumptions: All generators are in-service.  Filter any generators
    that are offline from the C{gencost} matrix before calling L{makeAy}.
    Efficiency depends on C{Qg} variables being after C{Pg} variables, and
    the C{y} variables must be the last variables within the vector C{x} for
    the dimensions of the resulting C{Ay} to be conformable with C{x}.
