"""Defines the PYPOWER case file format.

A PYPOWER case file is a Python file or MAT-file which defines the variables
baseMVA, bus, gen, branch, areas, and gencost. With the exception of baseMVA,
a scalar, each data variable is a matrix, where a row corresponds to a single
bus, branch, gen, etc. The format of the data is similar to the PTI format
described in

U{http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/formats/pti.txt}

PYPOWER Case Version Information:
=================================

The PYPOWER case file format defines the data matrices as individual variables.
Case files with OPF data also include an (unused) 'areas' variable.

See also L{idx_bus}, L{idx_brch}, L{idx_gen}, L{idx_area} and L{idx_cost}
regarding constants which can be used as named column indices for the data
matrices. Also described in the first three are additional results columns
that are added to the bus, branch and gen matrices by the power flow and OPF
solvers.

Generator Cost Data Format
--------------------------

NOTE: If C{gen} has C{ng} rows, then the first C{ng} rows of gencost contain
the cost for active power produced by the corresponding generators.
If C{gencost} has 2*ng rows then rows C{ng+1} to C{2*ng} contain the reactive
power costs in the same format.

  4.   C{N}, number of cost coefficients to follow for polynomial
       cost function, or number of data points for piecewise linear
  5.   and following, parameters defining total cost function C{f(p)},
       units of C{f} and C{p} are $/hr and MW (or MVAr), respectively.
       (MODEL = 1) : C{p0, f0, p1, f1, ..., pn, fn}
       where C{p0 < p1 < ... < pn} and the cost C{f(p)} is defined by
       the coordinates C{(p0,f0), (p1,f1), ..., (pn,fn)} of the
       end/break-points of the piecewise linear cost function
       (MODEL = 2) : C{cn, ..., c1, c0}
       C{n+1} coefficients of an C{n}-th order polynomial cost function,
       starting with highest order, where cost is
       C{f(p) = cn*p^n + ... + c1*p + c0}
