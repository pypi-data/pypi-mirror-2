    """Solves a LP problem using a callable LP routine.

    The LP problem is defined as follows:

    min     f' * x
    S.T.    a * x =< b
            vlb =< x =< vub

    All of the equality constraints must appear before inequality constraints.
    nequs specifies how many of the constraints are equality constraints.

    The algorithm (set in ppopt) can be set to the following options:

    220  - solve LP using ICS (equality constraints are eliminated)
    240  - solve LP using Iterative Constraint Search (ICS)
           (equality constraints are preserved, typically superior to 220 and 250)
    250  - solve LP with full set of constraints
