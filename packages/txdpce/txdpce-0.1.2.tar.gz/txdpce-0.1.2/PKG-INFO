Description: txdpce provides a Twisted Python class, DeferredParallelCommandExecutor.
        It allows you to register competing functions that compute a result. The
        execute method of the class calls them all one after another and returns a
        Deferred that will fire with the first success. The deferreds corresponding
        to the incomplete function calls are cancelled.  If all functions fail, the
        deferred errs with a list of the failures.
        
        The point is that you might have a couple of ways of getting a result (out
        of a cache, off the network) and you want to try them all, taking the
        answer from the first one that figures it out.
