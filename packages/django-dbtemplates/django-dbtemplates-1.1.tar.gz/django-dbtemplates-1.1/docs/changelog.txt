Changelog
=========

1.1 (07-06-11)
--------------

* **BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE** Requires Django 1.2 or higher.
  For previous Django versions use an older versions of dbtemplates, e.g.::

      $ pip install django-dbtemplates<1.1

* Added South migrations.

.. note::

    If you are using South in your Django project, you can easily enable
    dbtemplates' migrations, *faking* the first migration by using the
    ``--fake`` option of South's ``migrate`` management command::

        $ manage.py migrate --fake 0001 dbtemplates

    Then run the rest of the migrations::

        $ manage.py migrate dbtemplates

* Removed uniqueness on the ``name`` field of the ``Template`` model. This is
  needed because there isn't a ``unique_together`` for M2M fields in Django
  such as the ``sites`` field in the ``Template`` model.

* Made the ``sites`` field optional to support a way to apply a template to
  all sites.

* Added ``--delete`` option to ``sync_templates`` managment command to delete
  the file or database entry after syncing (depending on used ``--overwrite``
  mode).

* Updated translations.

* Fixed issue with incorrectly splitting paths in ``sync_templates``.

* Extended tests.

* Fixed issue with cache settings handling.

1.0.1 (04-14-11)
----------------

* Minor bugfixes with regard to the new cache handling.

1.0 (04-11-11)
--------------

.. warning::
    This is the first stable release of django-dbtemplates which comes with a
    series of backwards incompatible changes.

* Removed own caching mechanism in favor of Django based caching mechanism.
  The ``DBTEMPLATES_CACHE_BACKEND`` is expected to be a valid cache backend
  URI, just like Django's own ``CACHE_BACKEND`` setting. In Django >= 1.3
  an ``'dbtemplates'`` entry in the ``CACHES`` setting is also considered
  valid.

* Added tox configuration to test ``dbtemplates`` on Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7
  with Django 1.1.X, 1.2.X and 1.3.X.

* Added Transifex configuration.

* Use ``STATIC_URL`` setting instead of ``MEDIA_URL`` for the media prefix.
  Also moved files from media/* to static/* to follow convention introduced
  in Django 1.3.

* Use ReadTheDocs for documentation hosting.

0.8.0 (11-07-10)
----------------

* Added Finnish translation (by jholster)

* Added --overwrite and --app-first options to sync_templates command (by Alex Kamedov).

0.7.4 (09-23-10)
----------------

* Fixed tests.

0.7.3 (09-21-10)
----------------

* Added ``DBTEMPLATES_AUTO_POPULATE_CONTENT`` setting to be able to disable
  to auto-populating of template content.

* Fixed cosmetic issue in admin with collapsable fields.

0.7.2 (09-04-10)
----------------

* Moved to Github again. Sigh.

0.7.1 (07-07-10)
----------------

* Fixed problem with the CodeMirror textarea, which wasn't completely
  disabled before.

* Fixed problem with the ``DBTEMPLATES_MEDIA_PREFIX`` setting, which defaults
  now to ``os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'dbtemplates')`` now.
  
  In other words, if you don't specify a ``DBTEMPLATES_MEDIA_PREFIX`` setting
  and have the CodeMirror textarea enabled, dbtemplates will look in a
  subdirectory of your site's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` for the CodeMirror media files.

0.7.0 (06-24-10)
----------------

* Added CodeMirror_-based syntax highlighting textarea, based on the amaxing
  work_ by `Nic Pottier`_. Set the ``DBTEMPLATES_USE_CODEMIRROR`` setting
  to ``True`` to enable it.

* Make use of the full width in plain textarea mode.

* Added Chinese translation

* Added support for Django 1.2

* Updated French translation

* Added ``DBTEMPLATES_USE_REVERSION`` setting to be able to explicitely enable
  reversion support. (Default: ``False``)
