  used anywhere.
  [keul]

- added ``portletPageColumn`` class to every portlet column.
  [keul]

- title field is not required anymore.
  [keul]

- when not provided, title, description and body are not shown in the

  [nekorin]

  (i18n is the only way right now to translate some stuff).
  [keul]

- changed the "*Portlets*" action tab to "*Manage portlet*".
  [keul]

- changes the ``i18n:domain`` of the configure.zcml of the
  browser module to "plone" (this is not formally right but,
  again, is needed for really translate views name).
  [keul]   

- expanded left or right column if one of the two is missing,
  filling all space available. 
  [keul]

- the Plone 4 "Hide" portlet now works also there.
  [keul]
