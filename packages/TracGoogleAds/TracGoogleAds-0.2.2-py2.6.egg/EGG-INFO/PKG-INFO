Description: TracGoogleAds
        =============
        
        Previously known as `Trac Ads Panel`_, TracGoogleAds_ is a trac_ plugin designed
        to display ads on your trac_ environment.
        
        The main feature of the plugin is that it allows the user to persistently_
        hide the ads, making your trac_ environment less annoying to those who
        dislike ads and supporting open-source projects through them.
        
        *Plugin has been renamed and package hierarchy has changed to join*
        `other trac plugins`_ *that addressed* Google_ *services.*
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Installing the plugin is as easy as::
        
          sudo easy_install TracGoogleAds
        
        And then enabling it:
        
        ::
        
          [components]
          tracext.google.ads.* = enabled
        
        And that's it!
        
        Now, all you have to do is to go to the administration and under **Google**
        you have a **Ads** link to setup the plugin.
