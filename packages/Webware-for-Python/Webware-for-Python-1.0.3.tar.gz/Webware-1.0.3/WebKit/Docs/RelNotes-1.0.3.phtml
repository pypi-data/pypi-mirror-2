<a name="NewFeatures"></a><h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All worker threads are now tagged as daemon threads by default,
	thereby allowing the app server to quit even if some of them cannot
	be told to quit their work. This can be changed via the new
	<span class="filename">AppServer.config</span> setting
	<code>UseDaemonThreads</span>.</li>
	<li>The mod_webkit2 adapter now also works with 64bit builds of Apache 2.2;
	we have included pre-compiled 32bit and 64bit dll files for Windows.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Improvements"></a><h2>Improvements and Refinements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the <code>AutoReloadingAppServer</code>, we do not add files more
	than once to the watchlist any more. If a FAM module cannot be initialized,
	we try to use the alternative FAM modules. Besides <code>python-fam</code>
	and <code>python-gamin</code>, we now support <code>pyinotify</code>.</li>
	<li>Slashes in module names (from nested contexts) are now replaced
	with underscores, to make PSP and KidKit work with PyPy as well.</li>

</ul>

<a name="Bugfixes"></a><h2>Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The mod_webkit2 adapter interpreted the WKServer host address as
	IPv6 in newer Linux versions and then was unable to connect.</li>
	<li>The modified <code>FieldStorage</code> class used by WebKit did not work
	as before with Python 2.6 and newer. These Python versions already add query
	string parameters to the fields passed via POST, but differently to how we
	did this before. In WebKit, POST parameters used to completely override query
	string parameters, the values were not appended to possibly existing values
	in the query string. In order to stay compatible and because it seems to be
	more reasonable, we restored the old behavior even for newer versions of
	Python (thanks to Fionn Behrens for bringing this up).</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with FAM when files were imported while the thread loop
	was initialized.</li>
	<li>The <code>IncludeEditLink</code> setting had always been ignored
	(assumed to be True).</li>.
	<li>The <code>ServletCache</code> page in the Admin context did not show
	anything when caching was not activated.</li>
</ul>
