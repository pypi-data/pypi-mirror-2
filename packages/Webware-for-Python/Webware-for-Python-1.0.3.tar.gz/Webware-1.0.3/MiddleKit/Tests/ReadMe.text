The MiddleKit test suite is quite extensive. It's a great way to see if
MiddleKit is working on your system and it's essential to developing new
adapters.

To run the test suite, create a file, LocalConfig.py like so:

# LocalConfig.py
dbName = 'MySQL'
storeArgs = {'user': 'root', 'passwd': 'blarr'}
sqlCommand = 'mysql -u root -pblarr'
sqlVersionCommand = 'mysql --version'
# end

It can be useful to run one test at a time, especially when developing a
new adapter:
> python Test.py MKBasic

Or you can run a few:
> python Test.py MKBasic MKDateTime MKNone

Run all tests like this:
> python Test.py

Here is another example config file for a fresh MySQL installation on
Windows:

# LocalConfig.py
dbName = 'MySQL'
storeArgs = {'user': 'root'}
sqlClient = r'"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1\bin\mysql" '
  # typical MySQL 3.x: sqlClient = 'C:\\mysql\\bin\\mysql -u root'
sqlCommand = sqlClient + '-u root'
sqlVersionCommand = sqlClient + '--version'
# end

You can see what databases are supported by looking in the MiddleKit/Run
directory. At the time I write this they are MySQL, PostgreSQL and MSSQL.

Here is a Microsoft SQL Server config using trusted authentication:

# LocalConfig.py
dbName = 'MSSQL'
storeArgs = {'dsn': 'LocalServer', 'clear_auto_commit': 0}
sqlCommand = r'"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\80\Tools\Binn\isql" -E'
sqlVersionCommand = None
# end



If you are creating a new test model, here are some additional notes for you:

* You can put a TestEmpty.py in the model that the test suite will execute
  with a fresh store (one that has no initial data). See the TestEmpty.py
  files in the existing test models for details.

* You can put a TestSamples.py in the model that the test suite will execute
  with after the sample values have been loaded into the database. See the
  TestSamples.py files in the existing test models for details.

* You can have more than one config file for the model which will cause the
  test suite to run the model tests for each one. Name them to match
  'Settings*.config'; for example, Settings1.config and Settings2.config.
