<ul>
	<li>The modified <code>FieldStorage</code> class did not work as before
	with Python 2.6 and newer. These Python versions already add query string
	parameters to the fields passed via POST, but differently to how we did
	this before. POST parameters used to completely override query string
	parameters, the values were not appended to possibly existing values in
	the query string. In order to stay compatible and because it seems to be
	more reasonable, we restored the old behavior even for newer versions of
	Python (thanks to Fionn Behrens for bringing this up).</li>
</ul>
