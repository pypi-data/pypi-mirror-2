* Module 'utils.py' improved to have two main new functions: memoize and run_under_process
  - 'memoize' is a decorator that stores function results in memory and use it when the
    function is called again with the same arguments
  - 'run_under_process' is a decorator that run a function under a multiprocessing.Process
    instance, that means you use better the power of multi-core servers to generate reports

* To make the things easier to use decorator 'run_under_process', we created a new method
  on geraldo.base.Report class: 'generate_under_process_by', that stores the generation
  output in a temp file, using a process, and loads that file in the file-like object.
