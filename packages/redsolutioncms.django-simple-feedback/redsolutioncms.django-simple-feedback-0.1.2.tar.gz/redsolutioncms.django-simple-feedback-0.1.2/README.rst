Simple Django feedback application
====================================

Usage
`````

Add ``feedback`` to INSTALLED_APPS ::
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'feedback',
        ...
    ]

Load feedback template tags:


    ``{% load feedback_tags %}``

Insert template tag in your template

    ``{% show_feedback %}``

Include something like
    
    ``(r'^feedback', include('feedback.urls'))``

in urlpatterns. That's all!
    
Requriments
```````````

Note that feedback uses ajax form based on jQuery, so you need to include jQuery
in your page. You can install it from Google hosting. Just include 

	``<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>``

in <head> element.

Customize
`````````

You can customize these settings in your settings.py:
	

		``FEEDBACK_FORM`` - form, that will be displayed to user. 
		By default form contains email, topic and response fields
		
		``DIRECT_TO_TEMPLATE`` - Should application render feedback form 
		direct to template ``fedback/feedback_page.html``, or you prefer to use
		template tag in other templates.
