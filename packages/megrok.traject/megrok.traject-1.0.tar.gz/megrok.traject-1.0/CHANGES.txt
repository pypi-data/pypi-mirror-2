CHANGES.txt
***********

1.0 (2010-08-08)
----------------

- Can now also use @classmethod for ``factory`` and
  ``arguments``. This is useful if these functions depend on
  information on the class they are defined on.

0.10.1 (2010-01-25)
-------------------

- Added notes to documentation about deriving your models from
  ``grokcore.component.Context``, or what to do what you can't.

- Expose ``traject.Context`` for convenience reasons.

- Fixed ReST documentation.

0.10 (2009-11-30)
-----------------

- Support ``traject.Model``, a more compact way to define trajects if
  the model is under the control of the developer.

0.9 (2009-11-16)
----------------

- Initial public release.
