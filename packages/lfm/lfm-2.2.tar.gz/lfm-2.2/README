Introduction
============
**Last File Manager** is a simple but powerful file manager for the
UNIX console. Based on curses, it's written in Python.

Some of the features you can find in *lfm*:

- console-based file manager for UNIX platforms
- 1-pane or 2-pane view
- tabs
- bookmarks
- history
- vfs for compressed files
- dialogs with entry completion
- fast access to the shell
- direct integration of find/grep, df and other tools
- color files by extension [Andrey Skvortsov]
- support for different file names encodings
- fast file viewer with text and binary modes
- ...and many others


From version 0.6 and up *lfm* package also contains **pyview**, a
text / hex file viewer to be used with or without *lfm*. 
Read README.pyview_ for more info about it.

Some screenshots:

  **pyview**:

Type `lfm --help` or `pyview --help` for a complete list of options.

Program preferences are saved in `~/.lfmrc` file.
When the program starts the first time, it tries to discover the location
of some apps in your system to configure *lfm* automatically, but it's not 
perfect, so you should take a look to the configuration (`General Menu [F9] 
-> Edit Configuration [c]`) and change it according to your preferences.


Requirements
============
*Lfm* and *Pyview* are written in Python_ and require curses module.
It should run on Python v2.4 or higher, as but I'm only have v2.6 on my
computers I haven't tested older versions.

All modern UNIX flavours (Linux, \*BSD, Solaris, etc) should run it without 
problems. If they appear please notify me.

Since version 0.90, *lfm* needs ncurses >= v5.x to handle terminal resizing.

Python v2.5+ and ncurses v5.4+ to use wide characters.

Note that python curses module should be linked against ncursesw library 
(instead of ncurses) to get wide characters support. This is the usual case 
in later versions of Linux distributions, but maybe not the case in older 
Linux or other UNIX platforms. Thus, expect problems when using multibyte 
file names (f.e. UTF-8 or latin-1 encoded) if your curses module isn't 
compiled against ncursesw. Anyway, I hope this issue will disappear with new 
releases of those platforms eventually.

Consult `Files name encoding`_ section below for more information
about support of different encodings.

Finally, take a look at TODO_ file to see bugs and *not-implemented-yet* (tm) 
features.

'lfm' is very easy to install, just keep next steps:

1. Download sources_
2. Uncompress file
3. Build:
    `$ python setup.py build`
4. Install, as root:
    `# python setup.py install`
5. Run it:
    `$ lfm`
6. Edit settings:
     `General Menu [F9] -> Edit Configuration [c]`

    
To let 'lfm' to change to panel's current directory after quiting with
`q`, `Q` or `F10` keys, you must add next code to `/etc/bashrc` or to
your `~/.bashrc`::

    lfm()
    {
	/usr/bin/lfm "$*"		# type here full path to lfm script
	LFMPATHFILE=/tmp/lfm-$$.path
	cd "`cat $LFMPATHFILE`"
	rm -f $LFMPATHFILE
    }

If you don't use bash or csh shell, above lines could differ.


Upgrading
=========
If you upgrade from versions < 2.0, please remove first `~/.lfmrc` to 
regenerate a valid configuration as file format has changed. I advise you 
to make a backup copy before.

Also, note that some keys have changed since previous versions. 
Read carefully following section.


Keys
====
These are the complete list of key bindings:

+ **Movement**
    - cursor_up, k
    - cursor_down, j
    - previous_page, backspace, Ctrl-B
    - next_page, space, Ctrl-F
    - home, Ctrl-A: first file
    - end, Ctrl-E: last file
    - cursor_left: upper dir
    - cursor_right: enter dir / vfs
    - Ctrl-S: go to file in current panel
    - Ctrl-L: center cursor in current panel
    - Ctrl-P, Ctrl-left: move cursor 1/4th of page upwards
    - Ctrl-N, Ctrl-right: move cursor 1/4th of page downwards

+ **Movement in non active pane** [#]_
    - Alt/Shift-cursor_up, K
    - Alt/Shift-cursor_down, J
    - Alt/Shift-previous_page, B
    - Alt/Shift-next_page, F
    - Alt/Shift-home, A: first file
    - Alt/Shift-end, E: last file
    - Alt/Shift-cursor_left: upper dir
    - Alt/Shift-cursor_right: enter dir / vfs
    - P: move cursor 1/4th of page upwards
    - N: move cursor 1/4th of page downwards
   
.. [#] Some key shorcuts combinations such as Alt or Shift + key may not work, as it
       depends on the capabilities of the terminal program you are using.
       F.e. it doesn't work in my computer console running Fedora 11 Linux, but it works
       under gnome-terminal in X. Your results could be different.
       Anyway, there are alternative shortcuts (K J B F A E), but not for everything.
       Consult your terminal emulation program documentation to check it.
       Also note that you can allow/disallow this navigation with Ctrl-W, it's disabled
       by default.

Files name encoding
===================
Since v2.0, *lfm* uses the encoding defined in the locale of your system
if found, this will be UTF-8 likely.

Since v2.2, *lfm* was rewritten to always use unicode strings internally,
but employ terminal encoding (f.e. UTF-8) to interact with the user in
input forms, to display contents, and to pass commands to run in shell.

When *lfm* detects a file with invalid encoding name it asks the user to
convert it (can be automatic with the proper option in the configuration).
If not converted, *lfm* will display the file but won't operate on it.

Please note there are some restrictions to support wide characters by now,
as explained in the `Requirements`_ section.


Virtual File Systems (VFS)
==========================
You can navigate inside some special files (known as vfs files in *lfm*)
just *entering into* them (press *enter* or *cursor_right* when the
cursor bar is over one of these files). By now, supported types are
`.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.zip`, `.rar`, and `.7z` files. 

The virtual directory name ('path_to_vfs_file#vfs/dir') is not propagated, so 
tmpdir (`/tmp/@6421.2/dir`) is showed in the copy/move/... dialogs or when
view/edit/... a file, but this is just an estetic issue.

When returning from one of such vfs files, a question dialog appears asking to
allow you to regenerate the vfs file and update all changes (i.e., it is 
compressed again, so it could be slow in some machines), but `lfm` checks if it 
can do first, to avoid waste of time. This behaviour (rebuild or not rebuild, ask 
it or not) can be modified in the configuration file. By default the question is
showed but it's set to *not regenerate vfs*.
In case of `panelize` vfs type (after find/grep), deleted / moved files
are not deleted / moved in real path.

*lfm* doesn't implement remote vfs such as ssh, ftp, smb, webdav, ...
This is a design criterion, we don't want to add external dependencies
beyond python standard library. If you need to access remote file
systems you could mount them using something like *fuse* and treat them
as local directories from inside *lfm*.


FAQ
===
+ **How and why lfm born?**

  Everything is explained in next sections. `list.com` and `midnight commander`
  were the muses who guided.

+ **Isn't python slow? why develop lfm on python?**

  No. It's fast enough. And programming in python is funny.

+ **I've reading the sources and sometimes you don't use newer python features like ternary operator, with statement, and many others**

  We want to mantain compatibility with python v2.3 by now. Btw, you
  can find some of these interesting new features in the TODO_ file.

+ **does it work with Python v3.x?**

  No. We'll support Python v3.x when it is mainline (read, when my linux
  distribution of choice package it as default).

+ **lfm does not change to current directory after quiting**

  This can't be made inside the program, but you could get it using
  the shell tip mentioned in `Download & Installation`_ section.

+ **Why doesn't lfm implement remote vfs such as ssh, ftp, smb, webdav, ...?**

  One of the design goals for *lfm* is simplicity, we don't want to add
  external dependencies beyond python standard library. Also you can
  use something like *fuse* to mount those remote volumes anyway.

+ **Keybindings customization?**

  Not for the near future. Anyway, you can modify `actions.py` in the
  sources if it's so important for you.

+ **Mouse support? UI to configure settings?**

  I'm afraid we speak different languages.

+ **When will be support for internationalization?**

  If we are talking about translating *lfm*, the answer is mostly
  never. Ncurses programming makes very difficult to control the
  length of every text for every possible language translation.

  If you mean support for file names in foreign languages and
  encodings then it's almost here already.

+ **Some Chinese, Japanese or Korean files make lfm crash**

  Known issue. The characters of these languages span over 2 cells, so
  it's not possible for *lfm* to guess the real width they need.
  We expect to solve this in a near future as we are studying
  different methods.

+ **[Any other question / feature request]**

  Consult if it's mentioned in the TODO_ file and/or send me an email.


History
=======
Many many years ago I began to write a program like this in C, but after
some weeks of coding I never finished it... I'm too lazy, yes.
Then I saw the light and I started writing `lfm` to learn python_.

Code evolved and application got more and more features, used by many
people around the world on different UNIX systems.

But after the release of version 0.91 (June 2004) they were not more releases.
Not that I had stopped working on *lfm*, new code was written, tested,
rewritten again... silently... but different reasons made me to postpone public
releases... code refactoring, a new essential feature, source cleaning,
a wedding, a child, ahem... more code refactoring....

Anyway, from now on I'll do my best to release often.


Thanks
======
Thanks are obviously due to the whole python community, specially to GvR 
(of course! ;-) and all the people who answered my questions in c.l.p.

It's a great pleasure to code in a language like this.

Alexei Gilchrist, for his cfm program from which I took some ideas.

`Midnight Commander`__ developers, whose program was the guide.

`Vernon D. Buerg's list.com`__, the best program ever coded (well, just after emacs ;-).

And also to all the people who have contributed with ideas, reporting
bugs and code over these years: Antoni Aloy, Sebastien Bacher, Grigory
Bakunov, Luigi M. Bianchi, Hunter Blanks, Witold Bołt, Fabian Braennstroem,
Jason Buberel, Ondrej Certik, Kevin Coyner, Tim Daneliuk, Mike Dean, Arnå DG,

Daniel T. Schmitt, Chengqi Song, Robin Siebler, Andrey Skvortsov, Espartaco Smith,
Jörg Sonnenberger, Joshua Tasker, Tim Terlegård, Edd Thompson, Walter van den Broek,
Alejandro Weil, Hai Zaar and many others...

You have made posible to run *lfm* in all those platforms!
