Description: smartopen
        =========
        
        smartopen is a command line program that will transform text according
        to handlers to URLs and open them 
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``smartopen --help`` displays the program usage:
        
        """
        Usage: smartopen [options]
        
        Options:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG
                                config file to read
          -u, --url             print the first url handled
          -a, --all             print all handlers that match the query
          -H HANDLERS, --handler=HANDLERS
                                name of the handler to use, in order
          --print-handlers      print all handlers in order they would be tried
        """
        
        smartopen reads text from standard input or command line arguments.
        The handlers are then iterated through in a configurable order and, if
        the handler can transform the text into a URL, the URL is then
        processed.  Unless otherwise specified by command line options
        (e.g. --url, --all), the first matching URL is then opened in firefox.
        
        
        Handlers
        --------
        
        smartopen has a pluggable system of configurable handlers.  The
        setuptools entry point ``[smartopen.locations]`` is an extension point
        for the handlers.  Several handlers come with smartopen, or you can
        write your own.
        
        URL:  a resolvable URL
        Google: a google search
        Wikipedia: a Wikipedia article
        GoogleMaps: an address in google maps
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        smartopen uses a configuration file that defines the order of the
        handlers and their behavior.
        
        
        Interfacing With Your Environment
        ---------------------------------
        
        While smartopen is useful of its own right, its utility may be
        enhanced by using as part of an environment.  For instance, I run the
        fluxbox window manager which allows the use of hotkeys.  By binding
        smartopen to Ctrl+Alt+s and using xclip, I can open a URL that is
        mappable to a smartopen handler with a keyboard shortcut.  The
        relevant line from my ~/.fluxbox/keys file reads:
        
        Control Mod1 s :ExecCommand /home/jhammel/python/smartopen.py "$(xclip -o)" # smartopen
