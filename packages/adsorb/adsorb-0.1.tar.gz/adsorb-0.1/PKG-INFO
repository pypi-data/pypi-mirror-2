Description: Adsorption
        ==========
        
        Lightweight loose coupling library for Python. Add listeners to a named event
        and call them from anywhere to collect their responses.
        
        Event listeners are called in an undefined sequence and all responses are
        collected before execution resumes with the caller. Future versions may
        add support to call listeners in parallel threads.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Run ``easy_install adsorb`` or ``pip install adsorb`` to get from
        `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/>`__ (not yet implemented).
        
        To install from source, run ``python setup.py install``.
        
        To run the tests, install ``nose`` and ``coverage`` and run
        ``python setup.py nosetests``.
