Description: ``pyramid_exclog``
        ===================
        
        A package which logs Pyramid application exception (error) information to a
        standard Python logger.  This add-on is most useful when used in production
        applications, because the logger can be configured to log to a file, to UNIX
        syslog, to the Windows Event Log, or even to email.
        
        See the documentation at
        https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_exclog/dev/ for more
        information.
        
        This package currently will not work with any released Pyramid; it requires
        the Pyramid trunk (aka "1.2dev"), available from
        https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid .
