Description: A simple but flexible parser of SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) model and decay files.
        
        pyslha is a parser/writer module for particle physics SUSY Les Houches Accord
        (SLHA) supersymmetric spectrum/decay files, and a collection of scripts which
        use the interface, e.g. for conversion to and from the legacy ISAWIG format, or
        to plot the mass spectrum and decay chains.
        
        The current release supports SLHA version 1. Assistance with supporting version
        2 will be gladly accepted!
        
        The plotting script currently provides output in a source form usable by the
        Rivet make-plots system, but alternative formats are in the pipeline. Again,
        contributions or suggestions of new formats are very welcome.
        
        TODOs:
         * Identify HERWIG decay matrix element to use in ISAWIG
         * Split writeSLHA into writeSLHA{Blocks,Decays}
         * Handle SLHA2
         * Handle RPV SUSY in ISAWIG
