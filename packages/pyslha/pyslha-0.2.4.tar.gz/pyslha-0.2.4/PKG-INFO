Description: A simple but flexible parser of SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) model and decay files.
        
        pyslha is a parser/writer module for particle physics SUSY Les Houches Accord
        (SLHA) supersymmetric spectrum/decay files, and a collection of scripts which
        use the interface, e.g. for conversion to and from the legacy ISAWIG format, or
        to plot the mass spectrum and decay chains.
        
        The current release supports SLHA version 1. Assistance with supporting version
        2 will be gladly accepted!
        
        TODOs:
         * What to do about unlisted PIDs?
         * Split writeSLHA into writeSLHA{Blocks,Decays}
         * Handle SLHA2
         * Handle RPV SUSY in ISAWIG
         * Identify HERWIG decay matrix element to use in ISAWIG
         * Order decay products as required by HERWIG in ISAWIG
