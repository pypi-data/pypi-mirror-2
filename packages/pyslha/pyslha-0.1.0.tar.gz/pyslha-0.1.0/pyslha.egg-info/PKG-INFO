        supersymmetric spectrum/decay files, and a collection of scripts which use the
        interface, e.g. for conversion to and from the legacy ISAWIG format, or to plot
        the mass spectrum and decay chains.
        
        The current release supports SLHA version 1. Assistance with supporting version
        2 will be gladly accepted!
