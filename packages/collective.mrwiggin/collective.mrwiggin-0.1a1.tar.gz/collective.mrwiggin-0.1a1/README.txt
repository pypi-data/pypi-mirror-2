Introduction
============

Let ``collective.mrwiggin`` be your plone site architect and provide you with
flexibility to structure your sites with the power of portlets. It also provides
you with easy plugin methods you can use to define new layouts now with Plone
3.x and later. [so you dont have to wait for Deco :P /me hides]

This is alpha release of mrwiggin. Documentation as well screencast in on its
way so please come back when package gets to out of alpha or proceed with
reading the code.


Detailed documentation
======================

still to come ... but please feel free to kick my butt if i forget to fill this
