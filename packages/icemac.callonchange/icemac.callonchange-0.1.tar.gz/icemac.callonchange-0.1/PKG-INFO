Description: 
        
        icemac.callonchange calls a specific command when a directory or
        something in it has changed. It was developed to ease test driven
        development (TDD): it can call the test case under development each
        time the test case or the developed code changes.

        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Mac OS X 10.5+ (Leopard)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        icemac.callonchange can be used as standalone script and in buildout.
        
        Usage as script
        ---------------
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To install icemac.callonchange as script call::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        or install it using a package manager like easy_install or pip.
        
        Call as script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To call it as a script add the path to the directory to be observed
        and the command (script or program) to be called when the directory or
        something in it has changed.
        
        Example to call ``xeyes`` when something changed in the Downloads
        directory enter::
        
        $ callonchange ~/Dowloads xeyes
        
        
        In Buildout
        -----------
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Add a section to your buildout to generate a script for
        icemac.callonchange (don't forget to add it to the parts!)::
        
        [coc]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = icemac.callonchange
        arguments = "src", "bin/test"
        
        This creates a callonchange script for the src directory which calls
        ``bin/test`` on each change in src or a subdirectory.
        
        Usage as buildout script
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can add additional parameters when you call the generated script::
        
        $ bin/callonchange -t testObserver
        
        This command line calls ``bin/test -t testObserver`` on each change in
        the src directory.
        
        Run tests
        ---------
        
        To run the tests of icemac.callonchange call::
        
        $ python setup.py test
        
        or use buildout::
        
        $ python bootstrap.py
        $ bin/buildout
        $ bin/test
        
        
        Thanks
        ======
        
        Thanks to Malte Borch for the great MacFSEvents_ which
        icemac.callonchange is based on.
        
        
        .. _MacFSEvents: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MacFSEvents
        
        To do
        =====
        
        - Ease buildout integration by providing a buildout recipe with
        default arguments.
        
        - icemac.callonchange is currently not useable in situations where the
        command changes something in the observed diretory. (e. g. LaTeX
        documents can't be created with it as the creation changes the
        observed diretory which starts creation ... over and over again.
        (Need an ability to select file extension(s) for which the command
        should be run.)
