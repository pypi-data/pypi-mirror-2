==================================
themetweaker.themeswitcher Package
==================================

Overview
--------

A product for switching themes on folders (ATFolder and ATBTreeFolder) in Plone.

Author: WebLion Group, Penn State University.

Requirements:

- *plone*: 3.1+

Using ThemeSwitcher
-------------------

With quickinstaller installation:

Each folder will have a *ThemeSwitcher* tab that will bring up the switcher form. Here you will be able to choose from a list of installed themes.

Without quickinstaller installation:

Same as with installation except, you will need to manually type the switcher form path. e.g. http://localhost:8080/plonesite/folder1/switcherform, because the actions tabs have not been installed.
