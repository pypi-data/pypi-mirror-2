Description: ==================================
        themetweaker.themeswitcher Package
        ==================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A product for switching themes on folders (ATFolder and ATBTreeFolder) in Plone.
        
        Author: WebLion Group, Penn State University.
        
        Requirements:
        
        - *plone*: 3.1+
        
        Using ThemeSwitcher
        -------------------
        
        With quickinstaller installation:
        
        Each folder will have a *ThemeSwitcher* tab that will bring up the switcher form. Here you will be able to choose from a list of installed themes.
        
        Without quickinstaller installation:
        
        Same as with installation except, you will need to manually type the switcher form path. e.g. http://localhost:8080/plonesite/folder1/switcherform, because the actions tabs have not been installed.

        To Do List *(for developers)*
        -----------------------------
        
        - TODO (esteel, pumazi) use gloworm to change viewlet ordering on the subfolder basis [requires that each subfolder have a viewletsettingsstorage (via localconf?)]
        - rename to collective.themeswitcher and release into the collective
        
        
        =======================================
        themetweaker.themeswitcher Installation
        =======================================
        
        To install themetweaker.themeswitcher into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        - When you're reading this you have probably already run ``easy_install themetweaker.themeswitcher``. Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        - Create a file called ``themetweaker.themeswitcher-configure.zcml`` in the ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file should only contain this::
        
        <include package="themetweaker.themeswitcher" />
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        - Add ``themetweaker.themeswitcher`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs = themetweaker.themeswitcher
        
        - Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        themetweaker.themeswitcher
        themetweaker.themeswitcher-overrides
        sd.common
        
        - Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        Installing ThemeSwitcher in plone through quickinstaller is not all together necessary. At this point it only gives you an actions tab on your folders. Everything else is zcml declared.
