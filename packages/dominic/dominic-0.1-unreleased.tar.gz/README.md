# What

python-pure implementation of CSS selectors, and DOM traversing

# Basic usage

## documentation

    from dominic import DOM

    html = """<html>
      <head>
        <title>My Title</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p class="paragraph" id="main">Hello!</p>
        <input type="text" id="string" value="value" />
      </body>
    </html>"""

    dom = DOM(html)

    p1 = for p in dom.find("p")[0]
    p2 = for p in dom.find("p").get()

    p3 = for p in dom.find("#main").get()
    p4 = for p in dom.find(".paragraph").get()

    assert p1.text() == p2.text()
    assert p2.text() == p3.text()
    assert p3.text() == p4.text()
    assert p4.text() == "Hello!"
    assert p4.html() == "<p class="paragraph" id="main">Hello!</p>"

# Why ?

As a webdeveloper I have to handle HTML nodes within python code all
the time.

Hence this I love [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) and have a
extensively use of it's
[CSSSelector](http://codespeak.net/lxml/cssselect.html), I mean,
totally.

Althrough, lxml is built with
[C-based](http://www.python.org/doc/ext/intro.html) python extensions,
and whenever I need to use it in a sandboxed environment,
[Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=18),
for example, I cannot use lxml.

So that, when I've met
[py-dom-xpath](http://code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/), I decided to
write my own python implementation of CSSSelector, which translates
into xpath paths.

# Inspiration and thanks

dominic's test suite is a python port of sizzle's test suite.

thanks to [@jeresig](http://github.com/jeresig) for its **TERRIFIC** work
on [sizzle](http://github.com/jeresig/sizzle), such a clean and
easy-to-understand test suite.

thanks to [py-dom-xpath](http://code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/) crew,
it rocks out loud!
