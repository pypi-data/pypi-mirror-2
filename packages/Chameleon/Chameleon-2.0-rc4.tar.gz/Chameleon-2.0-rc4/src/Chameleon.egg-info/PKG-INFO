Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Chameleon is an HTML/XML [1]_ template language compiler.
        
        It includes a feature-complete engine for the Zope Page Templates
        (ZPT) language.
        
        The software is released on PyPi. To download and install the latest
        release::
        
          $ easy-install -U Chameleon
        
        Platforms
        ---------
        
        This library has been successfully tested on the following platforms:
        
        * Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
        * Python 3.1, 3.2
        * PyPy
        
        What's New in 2.x
        ------------------
        
        The 2.x series is a complete rewrite of the library and supports both
        Python 2.5+ and Python 3.1+ with a single source code.
        
        For most users it should be an easy upgrade, however note that at
        present, there is no engine for the Genshi language.
        
        New parser
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This series features a new parser, implemented in pure Python. It
        parses both HTML and XML inputs (the previous parser relied on the
        expat system library and was more strict about its input).
        
        Language changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The 2.x engine matches the output of the reference implementation more
        closely (usually exactly). There are less differences altogether; for
        instance, the method of escaping TALES expression (usually a
        semicolon) has been changed to match that of the reference
        implementation.
        
        This series also introduces a number of new language features:
        
        1) Support for the ``tal:on-error`` from the reference specification
        has been added.
        
        2) Inspired by the Genshi language, a pair of new attributes has been
        added: ``tal:switch`` and ``tal:case``, allowing flexible conditions.
        
        Expression engine
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The expression engine has been redesigned to make it easier to
        understand and extend.
        
        The engine is built on the ``ast`` module (available since Python 2.6;
        backports included for Python 2.5).
        
        Performance
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The compiler output has been optimized for complex templates. For most
        applications, the engine should perform similarly to the 1.x
        series.
        
        Very simple templates with tight loops (such as that of the "big
        table" benchmark) will see a decrease in performance. The compiler is
        optimized for dynamic variable scope and this lowers performance for
        templates that require only a static scope.

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.0-rc4 (2011-03-03)
        --------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed an issue where the output of an end-to-end string expression
          would raise an exception if the expression evaluated to ``None`` (it
          should simply output nothing).
        
        - The ``convert`` function (which is configurable on the template
          class level) now defaults to the ``translate`` function (at
          run-time).
        
          This fixes an issue where message objects were not translated (and
          thus converted to a string) using the a provided ``translate``
          function.
        
        - Fixed string interpolation issue where an expression immediately
          succeeded by a right curly bracket would not parse.
        
          This fixes issue #5.
        
        - Fixed error where ``tal:condition`` would be evaluated after
          ``tal:repeat``.
        
        Features:
        
        - Python expression is now a TALES expression. That means that the
          pipe operator can be used to chain two or more expressions in a
          try-except sequence.
        
          This behavior was ported from the 1.x series. Note that while it's
          still possible to use the pipe character ("|") in an expression, it
          must now be escaped.
        
        - The template cache can now be shared by multiple processes.
        
        
        2.0-rc3 (2011-03-02)
        --------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed ``atexit`` handler.
        
          This fixes issue #3.
        
        - If a cache directory is specified, it will now be used even when not
          in debug mode.
        
        - Allow "comment" attribute in the TAL namespace.
        
          This fixes an issue in the sense that the reference engine allows
          any attribute within the TAL namespace. However, only "comment" is
          in common use.
        
        - The template constructor now accepts a flag ``debug`` which puts the
          template *instance* into debug-mode regardless of the global
          setting.
        
          This fixes issue #1.
        
        Features:
        
        - Added exception handler for exceptions raised while evaluating an
          expression.
        
          This handler raises (or attempts to) a new exception of the type
          ``RenderError``, with an additional base class of the original
          exception class. The string value of the exception is a formatted
          error message which includes the expression that caused the
          exception.
        
          If we are unable to create the exception class, the original
          exception is re-raised.
        
        2.0-rc2 (2011-02-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed upload issue.
        
        2.0-rc1 (2011-02-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Initial public release. See documentation for what's new in this
          series.
