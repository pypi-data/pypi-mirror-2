Description: Overview
        --------
        
        Chameleon compiles templates to Python byte-code. It includes a
        complete implementation of the Zope Page Templates (ZPT) language.
        
        The engine itself performs 10-15 times better than the reference
        implementation and real-world benchmarks show an overall performance
        improvement in complex applications of 30-50%.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Works on Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, including Google App Engine.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        The code is maintained in a subversion repository::
        
        svn://svn.repoze.org/svn/chameleon/trunk

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.2.0 (released 2010-03-29)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where nested translations would fail.
        
        - Added support for passing in a translation function to the template
        constructor.
        
        - Fixed issue where translation name mappings would conflict with
        template function definitions.
        
        - Fixed symbol lookup issue with list comprehensions and lambda
        expressions.
        
        - Fixed issue with interpolation flag and CDATA; the effect of this
        flag is now recursive, which indirectly means that CDATA elements
        will be affected by a setting on a parent tag.
        
        - XML namespace fixes.
        
        - Template instances may now be used as macros; this will use the
        template in its entirety, including any XML declarations. This
        addresses issue #139.
        
        - Integrated Genshi implementation.
        
        - Allow expression interpolation on any tag which is not part of the
        Chameleon or ZPT namespaces (e.g. TAL, METAL, I18N or META).
        
        - Improve XML parsing error handling.
        
        1.1.2 (released 2010-02-24)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Avoid printing document header strings (XML header and DOCTYPE)
        twice; this would previously happen if a template would define these
        and use a macro on the top level which also provided them.
        
        - The repeat variable attributes (``odd``, ``even`` etc.) are now
        *callable strings*, e.g. legacy users may still call these attributes,
        but it is no longer required.
        
        - The ``odd`` and ``even`` attributes now return the English strings
        ``"odd"`` and ``"even"`` in place of ``True`` and the empty string
        ``""`` instead of ``False``.
        
        1.1.1 (released 2010-01-26)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Python 2.5 compatibility fixes (symptom: ``TypeError: default
        __new__ takes no parameters`` with the statement generating the
        error something like ``ast.Name("econtext", ast.Load())``).
        
        1.1 (released 2010-01-26)
        -------------------------
        
        - Made all tests compatible with Python 2.4.
        
        - Use the 2.5 AST for code transformation for compatibility with
        Google App Engine. The AST utilities required were copied from
        Genshi (license document included).
        
        1.0.8 (released 2010-01-12)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Use RPL license (http://repoze.org/license.html); include RPL and
        copyright notice in software.
        
        1.0.7 (released 2010-01-07)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed encoding issue of translated attributes. [kobold]
        
        - Fixed translation issue, that would prevent translation of tag
        contents with both named and unnamed subtags. [kobold]
        
        - Fixed issue where messages could contain a double space. [kobold]
        
        1.0.6 (released 2009-12-14)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed white space issue.
        
        - Fixed character encoding issue.
        
        - Fixed issue where macro extension would fail.
        
        1.0.5 (released 2009-12-08)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where the translation compiler would break on messages
        that contained the formatting character '%'.
        
        - Fixed white space issue.
        
        1.0.4 (released 2009-11-15)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where the file-based template constructor did not accept
        the ``encoding`` parameter.
        
        - Use more caution when falling back to dictionary lookup.
        
        1.0.3 (released 2009-11-12)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where traceback would contain erroneous debugging
        information. The source code is now taken directly from the
        traceback object.
        
        - Include Python expression in syntax error exception message.
        
        1.0.2 (released 2009-11-10)
        ---------------------------
        
        - Really fixed ZCA import fallbacks.
