Description: pyroutes
        =========
        A really small framework for rapid development of small python
        web applications
        
        Why?
        -----
        I got tired of dealing with the same boring WSGI-stuff everytime
        I wanted to make a small web-utility in django, but I didn't want
        to go to far away from it, so I made this little thing to ease the
        work a bit.
        
        How it works
        -------------
        The core of the system is WSGI, and a decorator called @route.
        You simple create add a route decorator in front of the function
        you want to handle requests to a certain path. pyroutes always
        tries to use the most specified path-handler available for the request.
        That means ``@route('/foo/bar')`` will always be used over ``@route('/foo')``
        given that request path is ``/foo/bar`` or longer that is :-)
        Notice that paths have to be given without a trailing slash.
        
        Example::
        
            @route('/')
            def index(request):
                return Response('Hello world!')
        
        
        Templating
        ----------
        
        pyroutes includes a small xml-based templating system called xml-template.
        For more information about xml-template, check out its bzr-repo from 
        http://bzr.sesse.net/xml-template
        XML-Template is released under the GPLv2 license.
        
        
        For more information about usage, see the wiki example.
