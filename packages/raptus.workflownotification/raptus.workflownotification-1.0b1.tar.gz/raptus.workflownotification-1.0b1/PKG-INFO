Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        raptus.workflownotification provides a pluggable way to send notifications to 
        predefined recipients on a workflow transition.
        
        To enable notifications an adapter is registered providing the INotificationEnabled 
        interface is registered for the desired content type, where the transitions method
        returns a list of transitions on which notifications are to be sent.
        
        To define default recipients for notifications an adapter is registered
        providing the INotificationRecipientProvider interface. Those may be named by the desired
        workflow name or by a combination of workflow name and transition name to allow
        different recipients by transition or workflow.
        
        To define a template for a notification register an adapter providing the
        INotificationTemplateProvider interface, where the same naming convention as 
        for the recipient provider applies.
        
        The adapters for INotificationRecipientProvider are additiv, recipients are collected
        from all registered adapter in the given context. For INotificationTemplateProvider
        adapters the most precise adapter win:
        
        1. named adapter with name [workflow_name].[transition_name]
        2. named adapter with name [workflow_name]
        3. unnamed adapter
