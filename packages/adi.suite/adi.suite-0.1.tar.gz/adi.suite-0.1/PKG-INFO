        =============
        
        This product will add a content-type 'Suite' to your portal.
        
        In a suite you can add several galleries, containing mixed contenttypes and file-formats.
        
        Currently supported contenttypes in a popup-display:
        
        - Image
        - File
        - Page
        - News-Item
        
        Currently supported file-formats in a popup-display:
        
        - all common image-formats
        - mp4 and flv for movies
        - mp3 for audio
        - swf for flash-animations
        
        Note: This product will add an additonal image-preview-size to your plonsite-settings (image handling). In case you have already customized these settings, please backup your setting before installing, because it will override formerly made customizations.
