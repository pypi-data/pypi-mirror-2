    <para role = "synopsis"> The script rtf2xml converts Microsoft's
     proprietary rich text format (RTF) format to XML. It preserves as much
     information the RTF files as possible, giving an XML author the choice of
     what elements to use for further transformations. </para>
     
     <para>After you transform the RTF file to XML, you can further transform
     the resulting file to simplified docbook with the xsl stylesheet I have provided.
     There is also a script

     <para>Please see the documentation for the full details.</para>




    <para>
        The raw XML file that results from an rtf2xml transformation seeks to be identical to 
        the original file--with the exception that the transformation is structured XML. 
        Ideally, only one could use rtf2xml and XSLT to change a file to and from RTF with
        not data loss.
