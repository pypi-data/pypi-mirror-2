        <title>Changing the name of the script (optional)</title>

        <para> I've been informed that Windows users need to have the
            extension ".py" at the end of the script in order to execute it
            directly. If you want to name your script rtf2xml.py, change to the
            scripts directory and rename the "rtf2xml" script to "rtf2xml.py".
        </para>

    <section id = "move-.rtf2xml">
        <title>Moving the .rtf2xml Configuration File (optional)</title>

        <para>The .rtf2xml configuration file determines how the script
            rtf2xml runs. You will find the .rtf2xml file in same directory as
            the one in which the tarball got unpacked. (This file will probaby
            appear invisible if you are using unix.) You want to move
            this file to a location where the script can read it. If you do
            not move this file to a location where the script can read it, the
            script will simply use the default values. You probably want the
            script to read the configuration file so that you can permenantly
            set certain options.</para>

        <para> Where you move the .rtf2xml file depends on what type on your
            operating system and your privleges. You can even have multiple
            configuration files on your system. How does the script rtf2xml
            determine which .rtf2xml file to read?</para>

        <para> The script first looks for a file called .rtf2xml in your home
            directory. If it does not find it there, it looks for in the same
            directory as the rtf2xml script. If it does not find it in either
            location, it uses the value in the rtf2xml script. So if you
            cannot create an .rtf2xml file in any of the above locations, open
            the rtf2xml script with a text editor and fill in the path to your
            .rtf2xml file. If you leave the value in the rtf2xml script as an
            empty string (""), and the rtf2xml cannot find any configuration
            file, it will use the default values. </para>

        <title>If All Else Fails</title>

        <para> If for some reason you cannot or do not want to use the
            standard installtion method involving build and make, you can
            still use rtf2xml. Simply copy the actual script found in the
            scripts directory to the rtfxml directory, both of which
            reside in the main directory created when you unpacked the
            tarball. If you want to use a configuration file, copy the
            .rtf2xml file to the rtf2xml directory as well.</para>

        <para> Now when you want to run the script, type: </para>

        <para>
            <command moreinfo="none">python &lt;path to script&gt; &lt;path to file&gt;
            </command>
        </para>

        <para> With this installation you use the script exactly as you would
            with a standard installation.  </para>
