* How can I integrate unittest2 and distribute?  Specifically, what would I
  set my setup()'s test_suite keyword to, in order to let unittest2 do
  discovery when I type 'python setup.py test'?

* Will that allow for passing the -m and -s options to unittest2, and really
  how can I get unittest2's richer discovery command line options passed in?

* unit2 -p takes shell globs, but I like zope.testrunner's regexp filter, both
  because it's more powerful and because it works correctly with doctests.
  E.g. I can say 'bin/test -vv -t using' and it will only run my using.txt
  doctest.  unit2 does not seem to filter doctests.

* load_tests() not called when -p is used?

* doctest example.
