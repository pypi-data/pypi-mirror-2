        Buildout recipe that creates self signed certificates, useful for adding SSL support to your
        development deployment.
        
        It needs the openssl binary installed in your system.
        
        Tests need to be written.
        
        Use at your own risk and specially, use real certificates in production.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Example usage::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = mycert
        
          [mycert]
          recipe = yaco.recipe.cert
          hostname = test.example.com
          country = US
          city = Springfield
          organization = Example Corp.
          locality = Springfield
        
        After running buildout you will have your self signed certificate in the parts directory.
