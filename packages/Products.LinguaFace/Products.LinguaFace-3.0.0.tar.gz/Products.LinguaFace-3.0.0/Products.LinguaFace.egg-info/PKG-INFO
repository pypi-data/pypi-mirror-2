        About
        =====
        
        LinguaFace : A product provinding an alternate view and behaviour for LinguaPlone
        
        Features:
        
        * Neutral contents is now visible in all the translations of its parent folder
        * Copy/pase, cut/paste, delete now acts on all the translations of a content
        * Workflow is optionally (in the ZMI) synchronised between the translations of a content
        
        Dependencies:
        
        * LinguaPlone 3.x
        * Plone 3.1.x
        * Zope 2.10.4
        
        **Important**
        
        After installation your portal catalog will be cleaned because a new index & new
        metadata are created You need to rebuild it. See "Install" below.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        1. Copy the directory of this product in your product's directory of your Zope
        instance.
        
        2. Go to the Plone ControlPanel > Addon Products, and install LinguaFace.
        
        3. Go to the ZMI > your plone site > portal_catalog, Click on Advanced tab,
        Click on "Clear and rebuild" to rebuild your site catalog
        
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        LinguaFace overloads a subset of LinguaPlone's and Archetype's templates.  It
        also adds a new extended path index which is the path of the canonical
        translation.
        
        Known problems when displaying neutral contents from all translated folders:
        
        - getObjPositionInParent has no more sense, so it will be useful to change the
        default sort_on parameter for navtree and folder views.
        TODO: an option in tool to change the ``sort_on`` parameter
        
        - In some situations, you could have some surprises when using the
        getFolderContents method, to retrieve the standard behavior just add
        ``contentFilter['getPhysicalTree'] = True``.

        * languageSelectorData & global_languagemenu deleted : these scripts are no more used by linguaplone 2.0

        in the contents view (too much confusion, too much problems with delete/cut/copy/paste/reorder actions)
