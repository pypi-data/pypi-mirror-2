0.3 (2011-06-02)
================

- Actually got the output wrong so jsgettext couldn't work with it. Fixed.

  evidently polib accepts *any* file and still gives output...

0.2 (2011-06-02)
================

- Error when referring to non-existent po file

0.1 (2011-05-04)
================

- Initial release.
