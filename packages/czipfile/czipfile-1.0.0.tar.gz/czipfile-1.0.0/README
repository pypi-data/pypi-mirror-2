czipfile is a replacement for Python's builtin "zipfile" module, and
provides much faster, C-based zipfile decryption.  The code is actually
95% identical to Python 2.6.5's Lib/zipfile.py, with some very minor
modifications to allow it to compile in Cython, and the _ZipDecrypter
class adapted to take advantage of native C datatypes.

Many thanks to _habnabit from #python in Freenode for pointing me in
the right direction in Cython.

To build:

  $ python setup.py build
  # python setup.py install

Cython is not required to build the extension, though if you want to make
any changes you'll want to edit the .pyx and install Cython rather than
trying to edit the generated .c file.

Included in the source distribution is a patch versus Python 2.6.5's
Lib/zipfile.py which can be used to create czipfile.pyx, if you want.

This package might require Python 2.6; I haven't tested it in earlier
Python versions.

I've put this release under the Python Software Foundation License,
specifically the 2.6.2 version.  I believe this to be the most
appropriate license for the code, given its lineage, though if I
should just use GPLv3 instead, feel free to let me know.
