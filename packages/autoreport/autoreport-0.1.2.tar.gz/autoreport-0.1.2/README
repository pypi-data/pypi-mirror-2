autoreport for django
=====================

Requirements
------------
  Tested with Django 1.1.1.
  Requires relatorio.

How to use it
-------------

  Install it by adding 'autoreport' to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings,
  (it requires running syncdb again for new models to be installed).

  Then, add a line like this into your main URLConf:

    (r'^autoreport/', include('autoreport.urls')),

  You should overwrite templates from autoreport's templates folder
  in order to match your project.
