Description: 
        =================
        xhostplus.gallery
        =================
        
        A image gallery product for Plone 3. It consists of a special image gallery
        folder, which can hold further image gallery folders and images, and a portlet.
        The portlet shows random images of the configured image gallery.
        
        The image gallery view is based on Plone's atct_album_view. This product
        comes with an modified version of fancybox. It does not conflict with any
        further installations of fancybox.
        
        jQuery is required in order to run the gallery as it is supposed to be.
