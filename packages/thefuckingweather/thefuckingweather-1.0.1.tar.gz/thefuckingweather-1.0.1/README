I wrote this mainly for fun. The implementation is ridiculously thorough
out of irony, up to the point of writing specific error classes -- but
be glad I wasn't insane enough to create a new class for the data. (Even
though I easily could have.)

The code is self-documenting so you shouldn't have any problem using it.
The basic way to use it, if you're including it in a program, is:

>>> import thefuckingweather
>>> thefuckingweather.get_weather("Wichita, KS")

and you'll get lots of return data. The data format is documented under
get_weather(). You can also run it from a shell: this output is pretty
to the average user but can also be parsed by the likes of sed.

If you're interested, the git repository is located at

disclaimer), so please don't treat it as an actual weather reporting
system or as trustworthy.

Enjoy!
