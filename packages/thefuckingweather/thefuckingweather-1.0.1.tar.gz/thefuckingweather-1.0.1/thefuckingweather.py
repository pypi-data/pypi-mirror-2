def get_weather(location, celsius=False):

    Retrieves weather and forecast data for a given location.

    Data is presented in a dict with three main elements: "location" (the
    location presented by TFW), "current" (current weather data) and "forecast"
    (a forecast of the next two days, with highs, lows, and what the weather
    will be like).

    "current" is a dictionary with three elements: "temperature" (an integer),
    "weather" (a list of descriptive elements about the weather, e.g., "ITS
    FUCKING HOT", which may be coupled with something such as "AND THUNDERING";
    this element is named as such because it always begins with "ITS FUCKING")
    and "remark" (a string printed by the server which is meant to be witty but
    is often not. each to their own, I guess).

    "forecast" is a dictionary with two elements, 0 and 1 (both integers). Each
    of these is a dictionary which contains the keys "day" (a three-letter
    string consisting of the day of week), "high" and "low" (integers
    representing the relative extreme temperature of the day) and "weather" (a
    basic description of the weather, such as "Scattered Thunderstorms").

    The default is for temperatures to be in Fahrenheit. If you're so inclined,
    you can pass True as a second variable and get temperatures in Celsius.

    If you need a degree symbol, you can use thefuckingweather.DEGREE_SYMBOL,
    for your convenience.
