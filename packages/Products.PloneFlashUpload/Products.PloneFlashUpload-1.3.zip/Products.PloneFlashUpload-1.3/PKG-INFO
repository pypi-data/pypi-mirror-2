Description: Plone Flash Upload
        ==================
        
        Plone Flash Upload is a Plone add-on product which adds an upload tab to
        folders which takes the user to an upload form. This upload form uses a flash
        applet to provide the ability to upload multiple files simultaneously.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The 1.3 version only works on Plone 3.2 or later. Product is compatible
        with Plone 4.0 and 4.1.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Use buildout and specify 'Products.PloneFlashUpload' as an egg dependency. (Or
        depend on it in your own product's setup.py).
        
        Once Zope is running, go to the Plone site's *Add/Remove Products*
        configuration screen and install the *PloneFlashUpload* product.
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        After installation of the product is complete, go to any folder within the
        Plone site and a new *upload* tab should be present if the current user has
        access to add new files to the folder.
        
        Additional Notes
        ----------------
        
        - The flash applet has been tested (and runs successfully) on MSIE6, MSIE7,
        Firefox 1.5 (WinXP), Firefox 2.0 (WinXP/Linux) and various Safari and Firefox
        versions on MacOSX. If a particular browser is found not to work, please
        submit an issue to the issue tracker.
        
        - Any file that is uploaded will try to use the content type registry to
        determine what portal type should be the result of the file being uploaded
        (ie jpg's created as Image's and random binary files created as File's). It
        should be observed though that only portal types defined within the PFU
        configlet are possible candidates (ie add more here if you have additional
        custom types you are using and have registered with CTR).

        Testing
        -------
        
        To run the Plone Flash Upload tests you must use the standard Zope testrunner::
        
        ./bin/instance test -s Products.PloneFlashUpload
        
        SWFUpload integration
        ---------------------
        
        Attempting to wedge SWFUpload 2.2 into PloneFlashUpload in an effort
        to resolve problems with Flash 10.
        
        See http://swfupload.org/
        
        Status
        ~~~~~~
        
        First pass integration of SWFUpload 2.2.0 Beta 2 using. Largely replicates
        the original behavior of PloneFlashUpload. Targeting:
        
        - Plone 3.1 (Uses jquery - support for older versions of Plone would require
        jquery to be included.)
        
        - Flash 9 or 10. (SWFUpload version 2.2 drops support for Flash 8.)
        
        Next up is a wider browser testing. Tested and works with:
        
        - Flash 9,0,124,0, Mac OS X 10.5, Safari 3.1 and Firefox 3.0
        
        - Flash 10, Windows x64, Firefox 3.0, IE 7, Chrome 0.3.154.9
        
        - Flash 9,0,124,0, Windows XP SP 2, IE 7
        
        Todo
        ~~~~
        
        - Wider browser based testing.
        
        - Update documentation to reference use of SWFUpload and it's licensing.
        
        - Style the Upload queue.
        
        - Move the JavaScript into resource registries.
        
        - Provide a simple switch to enable debug.
        
        - Use SWFObject for loading the Flash object to provide warnings about old
        versions of Flash? Is there already a SWFObject plugin for Plone?
        
        - portal_status_message (ploneflashupload.js) is used in the pre 3.0-way. This
        will need to be changed to the new cookie-based mechanism.

        - Load CMF permissions.zcml when on Plone 4.1 so the instance can start.
        [maurits]
        
        - Added Plone 4.1 compatible formbase import.
        [maciej.zieba]
        
        
        1.3b2 (2010-07-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Compatibility with Plone 4. Product still works with Plone 3.3.1.
        [sargo]
        
        - Handle non ascii filenames.
        [do3cc]
        
        - Corrected permission for ticket view.
        [do3cc]
        
        1.3b1 (2009-10-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated content creation logic to use the normal invokeFactory, so all the
        normal events are called. Also updated the file name normalization logic to
        use plone.i18n directly.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed folder listing from upload form. It was confusing, as it wasn't
        updated when new items had been uploaded.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed old Extensions/Install.py installation approach.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Updated documentation and package data to modern layout.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Use the new extracted `z3c.widgets.flashupload` instead of bundling part of
        `z3c.widget` ourselves.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Converted GenericSetup import step to use ZCML based registration.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Updated GS profile to be a simple integer to follow best practices.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Call processForm after ATCT content is created. This unmarks AT creation flag
        and calls IObjectInitializedEvent subscribers.
        [naro]
        
        - The allowed file size limit can be now set in the portal_properties as a site
        property with the key 'pfu_file_size_limit'. Defaults to 100MB (see
        browser.py L: 180)
        [ramonski]
        
        - When the user uploads image.gif but a file with that name has
        already been uploaded, try image-1.gif (up to image-100.gif).
        Fixes http://plone.org/products/ploneflashupload/issues/7

        - profiles/default/controlpanel.xml: renamed **new** configlet to be not
        deleted by the import_steps seetuphandlers.  This fixes also #27 - Can't
        find the configlet. [ramonski]
        
        - Added SWFUpload 2.2 into PloneFlashUpload in an effort to resolve problems
