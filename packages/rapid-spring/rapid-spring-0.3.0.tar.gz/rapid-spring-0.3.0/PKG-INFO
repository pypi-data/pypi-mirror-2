Description: Requirements
        ============
        
        
        -  Python (tested on 2.6.2 and 2.6.4)
        -  `python-bitarray <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray/0.3.2>`_
        (easy\_install bitarray)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Linux
        -----
        
        You can use *easy\_install* to get the package from the
        `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rapid-spring/>`_.
        
        ::
        
        easy_install -U rapid-spring
        
        If you do not have the script *easy\_install* available then use
        your distribution's package manager to install the
        python-setuptools (or similar) package.
        
        ::
        
        apt-get install python-setuptools      # Debian/Ubuntu
        yum install python-setuptools-devel    # Fedora
        
        Windows
        -------
        
        As there is currently no binary package, go through the following
        steps to run rapid on Windows:
        
        
        -  Download and install
        `python 2.6 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/>`_
        -  Download and install
        `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files>`_ (for
        python 2.6!)
        -  Suppose you installed python in ``c:\python26``, make sure the
        PATH environment variable contains ``c:\python26`` and
        ``c:\python26\scripts``
        -  Open a console and run ``easy_install -U rapid-spring``
        -  Rapid is now installed! Continue reading to learn how to use
        rapid :-)
        
        Why python 2.6? Simple answer: bitarray binary packages are not
        available yet for python 2.7
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
        rapid <verb> [arguments...]
        
        Where the different verbs and their arguments are:
        
        
        -  ``upgrade``: Install the latest package for all pinned tags.
        -  ``clean-upgrade``: Equivalent to 'upgrade' followed by
        'uninstall-unpinned'.
        -  ``pin <tag>``: Pins a tag and installs the latest package for
        that tag.
        -  ``unpin <tag>``: Unpins a tag. Does not uninstall any packages.
        -  ``install <package>``: Install a package. Does not pin any tags.
        -  ``uninstall <package>``: Uninstall a package. Unpin its tag if
        any.
        -  ``list-tags [tag]``: List all tags that match *tag*.
        -  ``list-pinned-tags [tag]``: Idem, but only pinned tags.
        -  ``list-packages [package]``: List all packages whose name
        contains *argument*.
        -  ``list-installed-packages [package]``: Idem, but only installed
        packages.
        -  ``uninstall-unpinned``: Keep only the pinned tags and all
        dependencies. Uninstall all other packages.
        -  ``collect-pool``: Remove pool files not needed by any installed
        package.
        -  ``make-sdd <tag|package> <dir>``: Extract pool files of a
        package into ``~/.spring/mods/<dir>``.
        
        Usually when a verb has a tag or a package as argument, an exact
        match is not required. The ``list-*`` commands will list all
        packages/tags that contain the given string and other commands will
        ask you to disambiguate when multiple matching packages/tags were
        found.
        
        Examples:
        
        ::
        
        rapid pin xta:latest   # installs latest XTA
        rapid pin s44:latest   # installs latest Spring: 1944
        rapid upgrade          # upgrade all pinned tags
        
        (the other commands are for advanced users mostly)
        
        Bugs/quirks
        ===========
        
        
        -  ``~/.spring/packages`` isn't scanned. This means that packages
        which have been installed using a different tool (e.g.
        SpringDownloader.exe) and were removed from the server (I don't
        think that ever happens now) before rapid was ever started, will
        not be picked up by rapid. As such, they can not be uninstalled,
        don't appear in listings, and collect-gc may even break them by
        removing their pool files.
        
        -  unitsync is noisy on standard output. This should be fixed in
        unitsync however, and not worked around in rapid.
        
        -  unitsync insists on scanning all maps and mods while we only
        want to know the location of the data directory. This should also
        be fixed in unitsync.
        
        
        Please file any other bugs you find on
        `the issue tracker <http://github.com/tvo/rapid/issues>`_.
        
        Feature suggestions
        ===================
        
        
        -  make-sdz command (similar to make-sdd) could be useful
        -  Improve the GUI (``rapid-gui``)
        -  Add GUI progressbar, even for the commandline script (may be
        useful when integrating it in another app)
        -  Machine friendly progressbar, so other apps can parse it and
        render their own progressbar
