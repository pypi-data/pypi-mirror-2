django-postgresql-manager Installation Instructions
========================================================================
This file contains information on how to download and install
django-postgresql-manager in your system.


Requirements
------------
This application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a functional installation
of Django. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from
http://www.djangoproject.com/.

Detailed information about the minimum supported Django version and other
Python modules that may be required in order to run this software are
available in the `requirements.txt` file.


Download
--------
You can download the latest django-postgresql-manager releases either from the
project page at the Python Package Index (PyPI):

  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-postgresql-manager

Or you can clone the project's public source code repository and then
check-out any stable release, all of which are tagged:

    hg clone https://source.codetrax.org/hgroot/django-postgresql-manager
    hg tags
    hg update 0.1.1


Install
-------
To install django-postgresql-manager, use the provided installation script:

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python `easy_install` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step:

   easy_install -Z django-postgresql-manager

(the `-Z` flag is required to force `easy_install` to do a normal
source install rather than a zipped egg; django-postgresql-manager cannot be
used from a zipped egg install)

Or if you're using `pip`:

    pip install django-postgresql-manager

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the `PostgreSQL_manager` directory,
which exists under `src`, somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it
from somewhere on your Python path.
