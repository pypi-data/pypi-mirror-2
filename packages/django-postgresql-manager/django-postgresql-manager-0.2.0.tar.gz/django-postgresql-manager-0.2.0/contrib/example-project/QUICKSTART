Running the example project
===========================
This document will guide you through the steps needed to run the example
Django project shipped with ``django-postgresql-manager``.

The example project has the following requirements:

- Django (``pip install Django``)
- Python bindings for SQLite 3 (``pip install pysqlite``)
- Python bindings for PostgreSQL (``pip install psycopg2``)

Once these are installed in your system, create the ``administrator`` role
in your PostgreSQL Cluster as described above::

    CREATE ROLE administrator WITH LOGIN CREATEDB CREATEROLE PASSWORD '1234';

Then load the example project's settings file in a text editor::

    vi settings.py

And make sure the ``postgresql_manager_conn`` database connection settings
are correct, otherwise the Django project won't be able to connect to the
PostgreSQL Cluster.

Next synchronize the Django project database (``test.db``)::

    python manage.py syncdb

Make sure you create a root account when prompted.

Finally run Django's internal web server::

    python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

Use any web browser to connect to the admin interface::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Enjoy.
