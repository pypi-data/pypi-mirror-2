Description: ==========
        Transhette
        ==========
        
        A simple Django application that  eases the translation process 
        of your Django projects. 
        
        Some of its features are:
        
        * Database independent
        * Reads and writes your project's gettext catalogs (po and mo files)
        * Installed and uninstalled in under a minute
        * Uses Django's admin interface CSS
        * Translation suggestions via Google AJAX Language API 
        
        Transhette was originally based on `rosetta
        <http://code.google.com/p/django-rosetta/>`_ , which uses
        `polib <http://code.google.com/p/polib/>`_. Both projects are distributed
        under the MIT License.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install transhette:
        
        1. Download the application and place the transhette folder anywhere in your Python path (your project directory is fine, 
           but anywhere else in your python path will do)
        2. Add a ``transhette`` line to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's ``settings.py``
        3. Add a ``BASEDIR`` settings in your project's ``settings.py``, with a value like this::
        
            from os import path
            BASEDIR = path.dirname(path.abspath(__file__))
        
        4. Add an URL entry to your project's urls.py, for example::
        
            from django.conf import settings
            if 'transhette' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
            urlpatterns += patterns('',
                    url(r'^transhette/', include('transhette.urls')),
                    )
        
        Note: you can use whatever you wish as the URL prefix.
        
        To uninstall transhette:
        
        1. Comment out or remove the 'transhette' line in your INSTALLED_APPS
        2. Comment out or remove the url inclusion 
        
        Security
        --------
        
        Because transhette requires write access to some of the files in your Django project, access to the application is restricted to 
        the administrator user only (as defined in your project's Admin interface)
        
        If you wish to grant editing access to other users:
        
        1. create a 'translators' group in your admin interface
        2. add the user you wish to grant translating rights to this group 
        
        Tutorial
        --------
        
        Start your Django development server and point your browser to the URL prefix you 
        have chosen during the installation process. You will get to the file selection window. 
        
        Select a file and translate each untranslated message. Whenever a new batch of messages 
        is processed, transhette updates the corresponding django.po file and regenerates the 
        corresponding mo file.
        
        This means your project's labels will be translated right away, unfortunately you'll still 
        have to restart the webserver for the changes to take effect.
        
        If the webserver doesn't have write access on the catalog files an archive of the catalog 
        files can be downloaded. 
        
        There is a useful search box where you can enter keywords to find the desired string.
        
        It is possible to filter the strings by their state "Only translated", "Only non-translated" 
        and "Fuzzy". Fuzzy strings are the ones that have been automatically translated by ugettext, 
        so be careful about them. You *should* check all Fuzzy Strings before saving your catalog. 
        You can identify them in search results because they are yellow colored.
        
        As well as you can download the catalog you are editing, you can also upload a catalog. 
        The "Priority" option defines if the catalog that is going to be uploaded has priority
        over the stored one. This means that *without* priority if transhette finds in the new catalog
        an already translated string, it will respect the old translation. If you *enable priority*
        the old value will be always overriden. Transhette manages empty translations as they don't 
        exist.

        Development
        -----------
        
        You can get the last bleeding edge version of transhette by doing
        a checkout of its subversion repository. This way you can add it
        as an external into your main project directory::
        
            svn checkout http://svnpub.yaco.es/djangoapps/transhette/trunk transhette
        
        Bug reports, patches and suggestions are more than welcome. Just put
        them in our Trac system and use the 'transhette' component when you fill
        tickets::
