        ===================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        ``collective.ATClamAV`` aims at providing antivirus integration to Plone
        sites. It does that by defining a validator that can be used with any content
        type that uses File or Image field(s). The open-source `Clam Antivirus`_  is
        supported which is available for all platforms.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To start, you need to have ``clamd`` running on some host accessible by your
        instances. ``collective.ATClamAV`` supports either UNIX socket connections or
        remote connections.
        
        Install collective.ATClamAV and setup the host & port or the path to the
        ``clamd`` socket in the control panel (default is a network connection to
        ``clamd`` listening on *localhost* at port 3310). By default *Files* and
        *Images* are going to be checked for viruses when added or updated.
        
        Adding anti-virus protection to non-ATFile based content
        --------------------------------------------------------
        In order to add anti-virus protection to your custom content types you only
        need to add the *isVirusFree* validator to your FileField(s). For instance:
        
        ::
        
              FileField('file',
                validators = (('isNonEmptyFile', V_REQUIRED),
                              ('isVirusFree', V_REQUIRED),),
                widget = FileWidget(label=u'File'),
              )
        
        Testing
        -------
        By default tests mock ``clamd`` and do not require it being installed. If you
        want to test your ``clamd`` setup as well, run tests on all levels i.e.
        
        ::
        
          ./bin/test -a2
        
        using the provided buildout. Two ``plone.app.testing`` layers (with the mocker
        and without) are provided if you want to integrate the package in your own
        tests, see ``testing.py``.

        ----------------
        
        - Disable virus validator during debug mode but log a warning. This allows
