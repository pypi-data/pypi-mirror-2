        ====
        
        Public Endpoint Entities Registry
        
        PEER is envisioned as a lightweight, global registrar for SAML Metadata
        representing both SAML and non-SAML endpoints (e.g., OpenID, IMI). It is
        intended as a focused activity to catalyze international use of federated
        identity. The service is not intended to be a replacement for federation
        or inter-federation, but is intended to be a tool supporting such activities.
