:Release: |release|

PEER is envisioned as a lightweight, global registrar for SAML Metadata representing both SAML and non-SAML endpoints (e.g., OpenID, IMI). It is intended as a focused activity to catalyze international use of federated identity. The service is not intended to be a replacement for federation or inter-federation, but is intended to be a tool supporting such activities.
