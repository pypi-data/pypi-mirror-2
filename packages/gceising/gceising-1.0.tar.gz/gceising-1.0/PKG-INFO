Description: ====================================================================================
        GCEISING: the Monte Carlo simulator of Generalized Canonical Ensemble of Ising Model
        ====================================================================================
        
        Gceising is a Monte Carlo simulation toolkit of the Generalized Canonical Ensemble of 2D Ising Model.
        
        The programming of this project involves tasks in three aspects: Time consuming jobs, Numerical calculation and Data virtualization.
        To improve the performance of time consuming job, we code it in C++ and then bind it via swig as a python module, which can be used by other modules.
        Python has many advanced data structures, from which it is so free to do scientific jobs such as numerical calculation.
        Though Matplotlib python package, we also can easily deal with data virtualization. If we use pyQT, UI design is amazing.
        
        Gceisng bases on C++, swig, Numpy, Matplotlib, and PyQt4.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        This package depends on Numpy, Matplotlib, and PyQt4 (swig are optional if you need modify the \*.i files).
        Once you have fulfilled these dependencies you can install the package with the usual command::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        if you INSTALL ON WINDOWS, you can use mingw32 or MS VC++ as C++ compiler.
        For installation of PyQt4 on Windows, PyQt4 binary package (build-in with qt and sip) is strongly recommended instead of source packages.

        Usage
        -----
        
        There are various ways to use ``gceising``. The simplest is add inline code as argument to the Python interpreter::
        
            $ python -c "from gceising import qIsing;qIsing.main()"
        
        This will create a GUI window which you can operate. Or execute ``python qIsing.py`` after ``_Ising.so`` or ``_Ising.pyd`` is built.
        
        It is also possible to manually call ``qIsing.py`` inside
        Python code::
        
            >>> from gceising import qIsing
            >>> qIsing.main()
        
        *Note*: 
        	``Ising.py`` in ``gceising`` package can be freely extended as need like ``qIsing.py``.
        
        Development
        -----------
         
        Get a local copy of the ``gceising`` mercurial repository with this command::
        	
        	hg clone https://gce-ising.googlecode.com/hg/ gce-ising 
        
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        The source code has been successfully tested on Linux and Windows with Python2.5 and Python2.6 respectively.
        Bugs on Mac OS are unknown.
