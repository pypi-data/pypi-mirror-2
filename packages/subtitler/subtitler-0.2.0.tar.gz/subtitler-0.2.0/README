Subtitler
=========

Subtitler is a small tool for downloading subtitles from opensubtitles.org,
contains a simple library for theirs XML-RPC API.

Right now you can download subtitles for films, series by hash or just write
search query and manage searching by your self. It is automatic tool and
suitable for automatic downloading, you will LOVE IT!

In next few days/weeks I want to add a simple Qt frontend suitable for doing
Krusader's action or any other file manager's action. It will be usable by media
players too, at least I hope.
