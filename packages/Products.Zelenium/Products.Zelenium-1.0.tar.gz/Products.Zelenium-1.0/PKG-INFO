Description: Zelenium Product README
        =======================
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This product allows developers to create TTW Selenium test suites
        inside their Zope instance, in order to do browser-based functional
        testing of their site.
        
        
        Installing the Product
        ----------------------
        
        1. Unpack the tarball in a temporary location.
        
        2. Copy or move the ``Zelenium`` directory to the ``Products`` directory
           of your INSTANCE_HOME.
        
        3. Restart Zope.
        
        
        Using Zelenium
        --------------
        
        You can add a ``Zuite`` object at any location within your Zope
        site.  It behaves as a standard ordered folder, with a couple of 
        differences:
        
        - It's ``index_html`` is the "TestRunner.html" view familiar
          from Selenium.
        
        - It derives the test suite (in the upper left corner iframe)
          from all OFS.Image.File objects whose names start with ``test``.
          You can use the OrderedFolder support to modify the order in
          which the test case files are run.
        
        - It provides a "Zip" action, which allows you to export the
          test suite, all test cases, and the supporting Selenium
          Javascript / CSS files as a single, self-contained zipfile.
        
        
        Reporting Bugs against Zelenium
        -------------------------------
        
        Please use the `collector
        <http://www.zope.org/Members/tseaver/Zelenium/issues>`_ to report any bugs
        you find against the product, as well as to submit patches, request
        features, etc.
        
        
        Adding Tests
        ------------
        
        Tests are just ``File`` instances whose names begin with ``test``.
        They should have a content type of ``text/html``, and should contain
        a table which defines the steps which make up the test case.
        
        See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/testrunner.html for documentation
        on the table structure and the Selenese language.
        
        
        Using Additional Metatypes as Test Cases
        ----------------------------------------
        
        On the "Properties" tab of your test suite, you can add / modify
        the list of meta_types which the suite will allow as test cases.
        Adding "Script (Python)", for instance, allows you to define
        test cases in PythonScripts.
        
        
        Nesting Test Suites
        -------------------
        
        Each test suite automatically includes the test cases of any
        suite it contains.  You can take advantage of this feature to
        organize your test cases in a hierarchy, running them in separate
        segments, or all at once.
        
        
        Including Tests from the Filesystem
        -----------------------------------
        
        Test suites now have a property, ``filesystem_path``;  if set, the
        suite will recursively load testcases from files in / under the
        directory pointed to by that path.
        
        The list of files to be included is computed via the following
        rules:
        
        - If the testsuite_name property contains the name of a file that
          exists in the directory, it is presumed to contain a list of
          files containing tests, one per line. The test cases will be
          presented in the order indicated in the file, and test cases
          may be included more than once.
        
        - If the testsuite_name property is empty but the directory
          contains  a file, ``.objects``, it is presumed to
          contain a list of files to be included, one per line;  only those
          files / subdirectories (if present) will be included.  In this case,
          the test cases will be presented in the order indicated in the file,
          followed by any test cases from subdirectories.
        
        - Otherwise, if the suite's property, ``filename_glob`` is non-empty,
          it will be expanded (via Python's ``glob.glob``) to compute the list
          of filenames.  The test cases will be presented in alphabetical
          order, followed by any test cases from subdirectories.
        
        - Otherwise, any file will be considered a testcase.  The test cases
          will be presented in alphabetical order, followed by any test cases
          from subdirectories.
        
        
        Exporting an Archive
        --------------------
        
        On the "Zip" tab, supply a filename and click the "Download" button.
        The Zuite object will construct a zip file with the following
        contents:
        
        ``index.html``
          the "TestRunner.html" framework page
        
        ``TestSuite.html``
          the list of test case files (rendered as static HTML)
        
        ``test*``
          your test case files (appending ``.html`` if the IDs do not have
          extensions)
        
        The archive will also contain each of the supporting ``.js`` and ``.css``
        files which drive the browserbot.
        
        
        Creating a Snapshot
        -------------------
        
        On the "Zip" tab, supply a filename and click the "Download" button.
        The Zuite object will construct a zip file with the same contents
        described above, and then save it as a File object in its own contents.
        
        
        Generating Testcases using tcpwatch
        -----------------------------------
        
        1. Download the ``tcpwatch`` product from Shane Hathaway's site:
        
           http://hathawaymix.org/Software/TCPWatch
        
        2. Unpack and run tcpwatch in its "HTTP proxy" mode, with recoring
           turned on.  E.g., the following command runs the proxy on
           port 9999, recording the request / response data to the directory
           ``/tmp/recorded_scenario``::
        
            $ python /path/to/tcpwatch/ tcpwatch.py \
                -p 9999 -r /tmp/recorded_scenario 
        
        3. Configure your browser to use an HTTP proxy on localhost, port 9999.
        
        4. Click through your site, exercising the features you are testing.
        
        5. Stop the proxy.  Run the ``generator.py`` script, pointing to the
           directory where tcpwatch was recording::
        
            $ python /path/to/Zelenium/generator.py \
               --logfile-directory=/tmp/recorded_scenario \
               --output-file=test_case_name.html
        
        6. Edit the generated test case, removing / correcting the various
           steps.
        
        7. Upload the test case to a Zelenium Zuite and run it.
        
        
        Capturing Results from the Test Run
        -----------------------------------
        
        Selenium has a feature which allows the testrunner to upload
        result data from an automated test run to the server.
        
        Invoke the test suite from your browser as usual, but append the
        query string ``?auto=true``, to the URL, e.g.:
        
          http://localhost:8080/test_suite?auto=true
        
        Selenium will run all test cases, and then upload its result data
        to the ``postResults`` method of your suite. (Note that you no longer
        need the ``postResults`` PythonScript in the root of your site, because
        the latest version of Selenium posts to that name relative to the
        test suite).
        
        
        Zelenium Product Changelog
        ==========================
        
        
        1.0 (2010-04-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Eggified, tested and removed deprecations under Zope 2.12.
        
        - Moved from ``svn.zope.org`` to Launchpad.
        
        - Updated included selenium to selenium-core 0.8.3.
        
        - Applied a fix from Rob Miller to make Zelenium Zuite objects functional
          in the presence of ``five:traverse``, making ``index_html`` the explicit
          default view.
        
        - Corrected the documentation in the README for capturing results of a test
          run (``auto=1`` -> ``auto=true``, in line with the Selenium documentation).
          Thanks to Yoshinori Okuji for pointing this out.
        
        
        0.8 (2006/05/16)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed unit tests by wrapping filesystem objects that are rendered
          during ZIP file creation - code in OFS.Image wants to acquire
          REQUEST and use RESPONSE.
        
        - Found how to make the dependency on ExternalEditor optional (thanks
          to Andreas Jung for the bug report).
        
        - Stripped empty filenames out of manifest, to avoid infinite
          recursion.
        
        - Added the testsuite_name property that allows multiple test
          suites to be built up from test cases within a single filesystem
          directory.
        
        - Upgrade to selenium version 0.6
        
        - Suites now recurse through all "folderish" subobjects, looking
          for tests (allows, for instance, tests to be loaded from disk via
          CMF's FileSystemDirectoryView).  Thanks to Malcom Cleaton for the
          patch!
        
        - Define zelenium_globals in __init__.py to be able to
          register the ``selenium`` directory for use as a CMF skin directory.
        
        - If debug-mode is set to "on" in zope.conf, filesystem-based testcases
          files are reloaded every time they are used, to ease development of
          filesystem-based test suites. This behavior emulates what the CMF
          Filesystem Directory Views do with debug-mode on.
        
        - Moved repository to Subversion:
          svn+ssh://svn.zope.org/repos/main/Zelenium/
        
        
        0.7 (2005/06/07)
        ----------------
        
        - Upgrade to use the Selenium "core application" from Selenium 0.4.0.
          See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for a summary
          of changes.
        
        .. note::
        
            The semantics of ``click`` have changed;  that command
            no longer waits by default, and the ``nowait`` modifier is no longer
            meaningful.  Use ``clickAndWait`` to get the desired semantics.
        
        
        0.6 (2005/05/09)
        ----------------
        
        - Add ability to suppress inclusion of Selenium support files in
          snapshot / download.
        
        - Add support for returning testcases from a mapped directory path,
          including recursion through subdirectories of that path.  Currently,
          the implementation has the following issues:
        
          o It only creates OFS.Image.File objects for test cases (no templates,
            scripts, etc.)
        
        - Add unit tests for Zuite.__getitem__ behavior, including support files.
        
        
        0.5.1 (2005/05/07)
        ------------------
        
        - Make passing / failing test cases in results view more obvious in
          printed representation by adding icons.  N.B.: at the moment, we do
          this by sniffing the HTML of the test case for the "pink" backgrounds.
        
        - Apply patch from the selenium-devel list to fix regression in
          testcase HTML extraction in ``postTestResults``.
        
        - Make the posted results folder into its own class, derived from
          Folder (moving the template out to a PageTemplateFile).
        
        - Further repaired recursive ZIPfile generation, including normalizing
          URLs in generated HTML.
        
        - Extended zuite unittests to test ``listTestCases`` and
          ``manage_createSnapshot``, as well as recursive ZIPfile generation.
        
        
        0.5 (2005/05/04)
        ----------------
        
        - Updated to use the "TestRunner core" from Selenium version 0.3.0.
          See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for more
          information.
        
        - Add unit tests for Zuite class.
        
        - Make ZIPfile generation work with nested suites.
        
        
        0.4.1 (2005/05/02)
        ------------------
        
        - Repair breakage of ExternalEditor link in ``manage_main``.
        
        - Compensate in display of test tables for non-padded integers
          in the IDs (make them sort properly).
        
        
        0.4 (2005/04/27)
        ----------------
        
        - Make Zuite instances recursively include their Zuite children's
          test cases (to allow easier organization of the test cases in a
          hierarchy).
        
        - Allow indiviual zuites to override the list of metatypes which
          can be test cases, via a new ``testcase_metatypes`` property.
        
        - Force Zuite objects to show order support, even in the presence of
          ExternalEditor, whose monkey patching seems to trip it up.  Surface
          the EE icon, if the product is available
        
          Note:  we are *forking* OFS/dtml/main.dtml and the version in
          ExteranalEditor/manage_main.dtml to surface order support, which
          is a pretty brutal hack.  We should probably get ExteranalEditor
          fixed, instead, and rip out the forked copy.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2005/04/26)
        ------------------
        
        - Record server-side data during ``postResults``:  Zope version string,
          product names and versions.
        
        - Captured additional request parameters in ``postResults``:  user agent,
          HTTP host, remote address).
        
        
        0.3 (2005/04/25)
        ----------------
        
        - Added ``postResults`` handling code to capture results as a sub-
          folder of the suite.
        
        
        0.2.1 (2005/04/21)
        ------------------
        
        - Correct the emitted HTML for input widgets (close the tr tag).
        
        - Fix unpack bug in code which punts on requests to "foreign" hosts.
        
        - Punt on handling XML-RPC requests (e.g., Epoz calls back to the
          server to run Tidy).
        
        
        0.2 (2005/04/20)
        ----------------
        
        - Added script, ``generator.py``, to create Selenium testcase files
          from the request / response logfiles created by tcpwatch.
        
        - Allowed test cases to be PageTemplates, as well as Files, to permit
          indirecting through properties of the test suite (e.g., for
          user id / password).
        
        
        0.1 (2005/04/15)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release
