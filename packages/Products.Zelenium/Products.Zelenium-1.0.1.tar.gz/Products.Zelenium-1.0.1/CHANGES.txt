Zelenium Product Changelog
==========================


1.0.1 (2010-04-07)
------------------

- Packaging update only, fixin brown-bag release (minus metadata files).
  Also, note move of bug tracker from www.zope.org to Launchpad.


1.0 (2010-04-07)
----------------

- Eggified, tested and removed deprecations under Zope 2.12.

- Moved from ``svn.zope.org`` to Launchpad.

- Updated included selenium to selenium-core 0.8.3.

- Applied a fix from Rob Miller to make Zelenium Zuite objects functional
  in the presence of ``five:traverse``, making ``index_html`` the explicit
  default view.

- Corrected the documentation in the README for capturing results of a test
  run (``auto=1`` -> ``auto=true``, in line with the Selenium documentation).
  Thanks to Yoshinori Okuji for pointing this out.


0.8 (2006/05/16)
----------------

- Fixed unit tests by wrapping filesystem objects that are rendered
  during ZIP file creation - code in OFS.Image wants to acquire
  REQUEST and use RESPONSE.

- Found how to make the dependency on ExternalEditor optional (thanks
  to Andreas Jung for the bug report).

- Stripped empty filenames out of manifest, to avoid infinite
  recursion.

- Added the testsuite_name property that allows multiple test
  suites to be built up from test cases within a single filesystem
  directory.

- Upgrade to selenium version 0.6

- Suites now recurse through all "folderish" subobjects, looking
  for tests (allows, for instance, tests to be loaded from disk via
  CMF's FileSystemDirectoryView).  Thanks to Malcom Cleaton for the
  patch!

- Define zelenium_globals in __init__.py to be able to
  register the ``selenium`` directory for use as a CMF skin directory.

- If debug-mode is set to "on" in zope.conf, filesystem-based testcases
  files are reloaded every time they are used, to ease development of
  filesystem-based test suites. This behavior emulates what the CMF
  Filesystem Directory Views do with debug-mode on.

- Moved repository to Subversion:
  svn+ssh://svn.zope.org/repos/main/Zelenium/


0.7 (2005/06/07)
----------------

- Upgrade to use the Selenium "core application" from Selenium 0.4.0.
  See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for a summary
  of changes.

.. note::

    The semantics of ``click`` have changed;  that command
    no longer waits by default, and the ``nowait`` modifier is no longer
    meaningful.  Use ``clickAndWait`` to get the desired semantics.


0.6 (2005/05/09)
----------------

- Add ability to suppress inclusion of Selenium support files in
  snapshot / download.

- Add support for returning testcases from a mapped directory path,
  including recursion through subdirectories of that path.  Currently,
  the implementation has the following issues:

  o It only creates OFS.Image.File objects for test cases (no templates,
    scripts, etc.)

- Add unit tests for Zuite.__getitem__ behavior, including support files.


0.5.1 (2005/05/07)
------------------

- Make passing / failing test cases in results view more obvious in
  printed representation by adding icons.  N.B.: at the moment, we do
  this by sniffing the HTML of the test case for the "pink" backgrounds.

- Apply patch from the selenium-devel list to fix regression in
  testcase HTML extraction in ``postTestResults``.

- Make the posted results folder into its own class, derived from
  Folder (moving the template out to a PageTemplateFile).

- Further repaired recursive ZIPfile generation, including normalizing
  URLs in generated HTML.

- Extended zuite unittests to test ``listTestCases`` and
  ``manage_createSnapshot``, as well as recursive ZIPfile generation.


0.5 (2005/05/04)
----------------

- Updated to use the "TestRunner core" from Selenium version 0.3.0.
  See http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/release-notes.html for more
  information.

- Add unit tests for Zuite class.

- Make ZIPfile generation work with nested suites.


0.4.1 (2005/05/02)
------------------

- Repair breakage of ExternalEditor link in ``manage_main``.

- Compensate in display of test tables for non-padded integers
  in the IDs (make them sort properly).


0.4 (2005/04/27)
----------------

- Make Zuite instances recursively include their Zuite children's
  test cases (to allow easier organization of the test cases in a
  hierarchy).

- Allow indiviual zuites to override the list of metatypes which
  can be test cases, via a new ``testcase_metatypes`` property.

- Force Zuite objects to show order support, even in the presence of
  ExternalEditor, whose monkey patching seems to trip it up.  Surface
  the EE icon, if the product is available

  Note:  we are *forking* OFS/dtml/main.dtml and the version in
  ExteranalEditor/manage_main.dtml to surface order support, which
  is a pretty brutal hack.  We should probably get ExteranalEditor
  fixed, instead, and rip out the forked copy.


0.3.1 (2005/04/26)
------------------

- Record server-side data during ``postResults``:  Zope version string,
  product names and versions.

- Captured additional request parameters in ``postResults``:  user agent,
  HTTP host, remote address).


0.3 (2005/04/25)
----------------

- Added ``postResults`` handling code to capture results as a sub-
  folder of the suite.


0.2.1 (2005/04/21)
------------------

- Correct the emitted HTML for input widgets (close the tr tag).

- Fix unpack bug in code which punts on requests to "foreign" hosts.

- Punt on handling XML-RPC requests (e.g., Epoz calls back to the
  server to run Tidy).


0.2 (2005/04/20)
----------------

- Added script, ``generator.py``, to create Selenium testcase files
  from the request / response logfiles created by tcpwatch.

- Allowed test cases to be PageTemplates, as well as Files, to permit
  indirecting through properties of the test suite (e.g., for
  user id / password).


0.1 (2005/04/15)
----------------

- Initial release
