Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package implements a new user interface for `Plone <http://plone.org/>`_.
        The design goals for this user interface are:
        
        * support a single form toolkit well instead of multiple toolkits
        reasonably well. The chosen form toolkit is `z3c.form
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form>`_.
        
        * Do not store application configuration in the ZODB, but use simple
        .ini-style textfiles.
        
        * One Zope - one site. No support for multiple sites in a single instance.
        
        * Use tiles everywhere. No viewlets, portlets or other concepts.
        
        * Only support one way to create pages: browser views. CMF skins are
        explicitly not supported.
        
        * Use documented markup patterns to add behaviour to pages. No KSS or
        page-specific javascript.
        
        * Minimal markup, move complexity to standard and documented CSS.
        
        
        
        Disclaimer
        ==========
        
        Although the name of this package may suggest otherwise there is little relation
        between this package and the old `NuPlone
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.NuPlone>`_ plone theme.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b3 - October 5, 2010
        -----------------------
        
        * Correct font reference for IE6 and IE7.
        [wichert]
        
        * Update form field dependency checker to deal with z3c.form's madness of
        always using :list for checkbox field names.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.0b2 - September 29, 2010
        --------------------------
        
        * Form CSS improvements.
        [cornae]
        
        
        1.0b1 - September 23, 2010
        --------------------------
        
        * Modify site menu to generate the contents of the actions menu in code. This
        makes it easier to extend the menu using a derived class.
        [wichert]
        
        * Make the email address and name of the contact person where emails are send
        to configurable via appconfig.
        [wichert]
        
        * Move ``dfn`` elements for tooltips outside ``label`` elements to make sure
        we can handle click events for them. Otherwise browsers pretend the click
        was targeted to the input element inside the label.

        1.0a2 - September 9, 2010
        -------------------------
        
        * Update error page handler to deal with double acquisition wrapping which
        can happen on certain NotFound errors in Zope 2.12.
        [wichert]
        
        * Add `plone.app.testing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.testing>`_
        based test fixture.
        [wichert]
        
        * Delete some old copy/paste leftovers from `Euphorie
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Euphorie>`_.
        [wichert]
