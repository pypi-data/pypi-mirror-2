Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package implements a new user interface for `Plone <http://plone.org/>`_.
        The design goals for this user interface are:
        
        * support a single form toolkit well instead of multiple toolkits
        reasonably well. The chosen form toolkit is `z3c.form
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form>`_.
        
        * Do not store application configuration in the ZODB, but use simple
        .ini-style textfiles.
        
        * One Zope - one site. No support for multiple sites in a single instance.
        
        * Use tiles everywhere. No viewlets, portlets or other concepts.
        
        * Only support one way to create pages: browser views. CMF skins are
        explicitly not supported.
        
        * Use documented markup patterns to add behaviour to pages. No KSS or
        page-specific javascript.
        
        * Minimal markup, move complexity to standard and documented CSS.
        
        
        
        Disclaimer
        ==========
        
        Although the name of this package may suggest otherwise there is little relation
        between this package and the old `NuPlone
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.NuPlone>`_ plone theme.
