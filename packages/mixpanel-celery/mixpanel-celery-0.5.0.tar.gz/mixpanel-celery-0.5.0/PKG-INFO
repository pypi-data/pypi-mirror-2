        mixpanel-celery - Asynchronous event tracking for Mixpanel

        Documentation
        =============
        
        mixpanel-celery helps you use `Celery`_ to asynchronously track your `Mixpanel`_
        events. Waiting on HTTP requests to Mixpanel's api to complete every time you
        want to record something slows you down. Using mixpanel-celery gives you all of
        the Mixpanel goodness without any of the potential performance impact.
        
        mixpanel-celery works great with Django, but because Celery works with just
        python, so does mixpanel-celery.
        
        For full documenation, you can build the `sphinx`_ documentation yourself or
        vist the `online mixpanel-celery documentation`_
        
        This project isn't affiliated with the `Mixpanel`_ company. Just a customer's
        implementation of a client for their service.
