        ==============
        
        0.2rc (2011-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        * setDefaultRoles for the add permission, otherwise the permission won't exist to
        some of the old CMF stuff. [robinharms]
        * Tests not layer based [robinharms]
        
        
        0.2b (2011-03-03)
        -----------------
        * Updated tests for Plone 4 compatibility [robinharms]
        * Using locales instead of i18n. The later had problems with the i18n message factory [robinharms]
        * Dropping skin layer creation of MemberProfiles to cause less
        incompatibility-problems with other packages [robinharms]
        * Dropped support for complete profile methods by default. May be readded later. [robinharms]
        * No longer automatic installation of Kupu properties in Plone 3. See KNOWN_ISSUES.txt [robinharms]
        
        0.1b6/7 (2010-10-26)
        --------------------
        
        * Added a fullname sync. [mlundwall]
        * Added a title fallback to username if no fullname exists. [mlundwall]
        * Added zcml auto include. [mlundwall]
        * Don't run kupu tests if kupu doesn't exist. (TinyMCE default on P4) [robinharms]
        * Add same config to TinyMCE as Kupu would have had. (Plone4 Support) [robinharms]
        
        0.1b5 (2010-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Added configuration for whether or not to enforce complete profiles. [mlundwall]
        
        0.1b4 (2010-01-26)
        ------------------
        
        * Memberprofile creation uses contenttype setting in portal_membersip. [mlundwall]
        * author.py script now redirects correctly. [mlundwall]
        * Archetypes initialized event thrown on memberarea creation. [mlundwall]
        * Made MemberProfiles registered as collection for Kupu. [mlundwall]
        * Check for existence of a memfolder was wrong. [mlundwall]
        
        0.1b3 (2009-12-01)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed i18n problems, Swedish showed up wrong. [mlundwall]
        
        0.1b2 - (2009-11-10)
        --------------------
        
        * The manifest file excluded the GS xml. Fixed [robinharms]
        
        0.1b1 - (2009-11-09)
        --------------------
        
        * Added tool for creating member areas which is called by the overriden, login_next.cpy in skins.
        Subscribers don't work for this case, and it wasn't a good idea to let Plone run createMemberArea script. [robinharms]
        * Firstname and Lastname are now installed as default. [robinharms]
        * Added controlpanel for choosing firstname / lastname or userid as title. [robinharms]
        * Removed overrides.zcml - Blocking the Plone dashboard should be optional, or a skin [robinharms]
        * getText is no longer an accessor for description changed. Now description is more of a tagline, and text field can be biography or similar. [robinharms]
        * Managed to get rid of all subscribers. Everything works without them now. [robinharms]
        * Controlpanel for membership ids, so it's possible to enable only lowercase ids. (Uses portal_registration tool) [robinharms]
        
        0.1b - (2009-10-30)
        -------------------
        
        * Initial beta release [robinharms]

        Known Issues
        ============
        
        
        * Installation as linkable type in kupu library tool stopped working in 3.3.5.
        Since Kupu will disappear and support for Plone 3 will be dropped sooner or later
        I'm not fixing this. It's possible to add the config manually anyway.
        It doesn't affect Plone 4 at all unless you're using Kupu.
