-- Blocklist rather than delete

Block a member by it's id.
A lot of lookups is on the members id rather than the uid. If a user is deleted and someone else registers in the same name it will look like the newly registered users owns the old content items. (That user can't change them though)
A blocklist managed through the control panel could disable login and decide what to do with memembers.

-- Delete tool
Wee need a tool to delete members that also handles their comments, content items and might delete profile page. The block might need to stay in effect though, since new members could register in the same name.

-- Revert manager
Open enviroments are particularly vulnerable to bot attacks. We might need a revert manager similar to what wikis use. Should be able to handle regex pattern matching or match on user name.
