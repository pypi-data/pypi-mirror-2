PloneKeywordExplorer is an alternative to the usual Plone search.
Searches are restricted to combinations of keywords.

The search is iterative. Keywords can be added and removed from
the search at any time, allowing the user to conveniently explore
the document space. The result set can be narrowed down to a few
documents in a few steps. 

PloneKeywordExplorer depends on well-chosen keywords, and supports
finding documents that don't have keywords associated. When you
click on the [no keywords], you get a list of all documents that
do not have keywords. You can browse through this list and start
annotating your documents.

Requirements
############

Plone 2.1, Plone 2.5 or Plone 3.0


How does it work?
#################

A search form is provided that offers a choice of keywords. These
keywords are chosen from the published documents of your site. 
You can select and remove keywords by clicking on them.
