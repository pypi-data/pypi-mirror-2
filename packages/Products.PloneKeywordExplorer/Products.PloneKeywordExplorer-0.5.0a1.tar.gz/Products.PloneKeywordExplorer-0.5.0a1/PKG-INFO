        PloneKeywordExplorer is an alternative to the usual Plone search.
        Searches are restricted to combinations of keywords.
        
        The search is iterative. Keywords can be added and removed from
        the search at any time, allowing the user to conveniently explore
        the document space. The result set can be narrowed down to a few
        documents in a few steps. 
        
        PloneKeywordExplorer depends on well-chosen keywords, and supports
        finding documents that don't have keywords associated. When you
        click on the [no keywords], you get a list of all documents that
        do not have keywords. You can browse through this list and start
        annotating your documents.
