Schools Plone Theme Installation
================================

To install quintagroup.theme.schools to your Plone 4 buildout-based project:

* Add ``quintagroup.theme.schools`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.theme.schools

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.theme.schools

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
    
* Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/instance restart
   
* Install Schools Theme with Quickinstaller in Plone (Site Setup -> Add/Remove Products)
