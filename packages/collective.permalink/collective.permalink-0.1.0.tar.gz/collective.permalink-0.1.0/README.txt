Manual
======

This product will add a `permalink`__ to every supported Plone content, using the Plone *resolveuid*
feature.

__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink

This will not work (and show anything) for contents without the *UID* information. You can however 
customize and develop additional adapters for providing permalink for yours non-AT contents (or customize
the default one).

The new resource will be added to the *document actions* section.
