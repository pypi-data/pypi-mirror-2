        Virtual 3D gallery for Plone
        ============================
        
        hexagonit.virtualgallery is a Plone add-on that renders a Flash-based 3D virtual gallery.

        Installation
        ============

        Usage
        =====
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        This package adds the "Virtual 3D gallery" display mode to Folder and Collection. So, go to any folder or collection that contains images and select "Virtual 3D gallery" from the display drop-down menu. That's it!
        
        AJAX usage
        ----------
        
        You might want to display the gallery somewhere else or possibly in a toolbarless new window. To keep all Plone stuff away from the virtual gallery use a URL like below to only get the title of the gallery and the Flash object that displays it::
        
            http://<path>/<to>/<your>/<gallery>/<folder>/virtualgallery?ajax_load=1&ajax_include_head=1
