=====================
Using Zope 2 Instance
=====================

The use of Zope 2 Instance is best demonstrated by example. The
:file:`buildout.cfg` below shows all the elements of the recipe you
are likely to need:

- You should lock down the versions of packages used to those in the
  "known good set" for the Zope version you are targetting using an
  `extends` key pointing at the configuration containing the
  relevent "known good set". 

- You specify the name of the deployment section the instance should
  use with the `deployment` key.

- Any extension packages you wish to use in your instance, such as
  those containing Zope Products, should be specified in the `eggs`
  key.

- The full contents of the :file:`zope.conf` you require should be put
  in the key of the same name. You should use buildout's templating to
  define the paths required within :file:`zope.conf`. In particular,
  you should use the locations provided by the deployment section to
  build the paths for the relevent resources, as shown in he example
  below.

.. topic:: buildout.cfg
 :class: write-file

 ::

  [buildout]
  parts = instance
  # if you want to use a particular zope version, include a line
  # such as:
  # extends = http://download.zope.org/Zope2/index/2.12.7/versions.cfg

  [instance]
  recipe = zope2instance:server
  deployment = demo
  eggs = 
    mailinglogger
  zope.conf =
    instancehome ${buildout:directory}
   <http-server>
     address 8080
   </http-server>
   %import mailinglogger
   <eventlog> 
     level info
     <logfile>
       path  ${demo:log-directory}/${demo:name}-event.log
       level info
     </logfile>
     <mailing-logger>
       level   critical
       from    support@example.com
       to      monkeys@example.com
     </mailing-logger>
   </eventlog>
   <logger access>
     level WARN
     <logfile>
       path ${demo:log-directory}/${demo:name}-Z2.log
       format %(message)s
     </logfile>
   </logger>

   <zodb_db main>
     <filestorage main>
        path ${buildout:directory}/Data.fs
     </filestorage>
     mount-point /
   </zodb_db>

   <zodb_db temporary>
     <temporarystorage>
       name temporary storage for sessioning
     </temporarystorage>
     mount-point /temp_folder
     container-class Products.TemporaryFolder.TemporaryContainer
   </zodb_db>

  [demo]
  recipe = gocept.recipe.deploymentsandbox

Running the buildout will show you the locations of the normal
:file:`zopectl` and :file:`runzope` scripts::

  Installing demo.
  Installing instance.
  Generated script '/sample-buildout/parts/demo/etc/init.d/demo-instance-zopectl'.
  Generated interpreter '/sample-buildout/parts/demo/etc/init.d/demo-instance-py'.
  Generated script '/sample-buildout/parts/demo/etc/init.d/demo-instance-runzope'.

.. -> output

A python interpreter with
a name ending in :file:`-py` will also be created. This is required
for :file:`runzope` to work but can also be a handy way of getting a
python prompt with all your packages available but without the
overhead of start up a `zopectl debug` session.

A :file:`zope.conf` will also de created in the `etc-directory`
defined by the deployment. For the above example, it would contain::

   instancehome /sample-buildout
   <http-server>
   address 8080
   </http-server>
   %import mailinglogger
   <eventlog>
   level info
   <logfile>
   path  /sample-buildout/parts/demo/var/log/demo/demo-event.log
   level info
   </logfile>
   <mailing-logger>
   level   critical
   from    support@example.com
   to      monkeys@example.com
   </mailing-logger>
   </eventlog>
   <logger access>
   level WARN
   <logfile>
   path /sample-buildout/parts/demo/var/log/demo/demo-Z2.log
   format %(message)s
   </logfile>
   </logger>
   <zodb_db main>
   <filestorage main>
   path /sample-buildout/Data.fs
   </filestorage>
   mount-point /
   </zodb_db>
   <zodb_db temporary>
   <temporarystorage>
   name temporary storage for sessioning
   </temporarystorage>
   mount-point /temp_folder
   container-class Products.TemporaryFolder.TemporaryContainer
   </zodb_db>

.. -> zope_conf


.. invisible-code-block: python

  # check the buildout worked
  check(output,system(buildout))

  # check the contents of zope.conf
  check(zope_conf.strip(),
        td.read('parts/demo/etc/demo/demo-instance-zope.conf').strip())

  # fix the port to the one we know is free
  replace('parts/demo/etc/demo/demo-instance-zope.conf',
          '8080',port)

  # Mac OS has funny ideas about how long socket paths can be
  replace(
      'parts/demo/etc/init.d/demo-instance-zopectl',
      td.path+'/parts/demo/var/run/demo/demo-instance-zdaemon.sock',
      dir+'/z.sock'
      )

.. some tests:

  Check the instance starts:

  >>> print system(td.path+'/parts/demo/etc/init.d/demo-instance-zopectl start')
  . 
  daemon process started, pid=...
  <BLANKLINE>

  >>> wait_for_started('parts/demo/var/log/demo/demo-event.log')

  Check we can connect to it:

  >>> from urllib import urlopen
  >>> 'Welcome to <strong>Zope</strong>' in urlopen('http://127.0.0.1:'+port).read()
  True

  Check the instance stops:

  >>> print system(td.path+'/parts/demo/etc/init.d/demo-instance-zopectl stop')
  . 
  daemon process stopped
  <BLANKLINE>
