===============
Zope 2 Instance
===============

This package provides a `buildout`__ recipe for creating a Zope 2
instance based around a `deployment`. 

The `deployment` concept originates from `zc.recipe.deployment`__ and
allows the deployment to control where resources of a particular type
are created.

While `zc.recipe.deployment` is suited to production use, you will
likely find that `gocept.recipe.deploymentsandbox`__ is more useful for
development.

This recipe is only compatible with Zope 2.12+.
