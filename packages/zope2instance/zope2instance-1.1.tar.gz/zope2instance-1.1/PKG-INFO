Description: ===============
        Zope 2 Instance
        ===============
        
        This package provides a `buildout`__ recipe for creating a Zope 2
        instance based around a `deployment`. 
        
        The `deployment` concept originates from `zc.recipe.deployment`__ and
        allows the deployment to control where resources of a particular type
        are created.
        
        While `zc.recipe.deployment` is suited to production use, you will
        likely find that `gocept.recipe.deploymentsandbox`__ is more useful for
        development.
