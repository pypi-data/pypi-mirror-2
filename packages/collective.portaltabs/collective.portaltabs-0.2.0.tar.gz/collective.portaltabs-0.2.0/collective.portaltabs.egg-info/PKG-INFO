        When you need this
        ------------------
        
        You need this product when you want to give to your non-technical users the ability to
        manage the *portal tabs* section of your Plone site.
        
        Going deeply:
        
        * you don't want that your users (even if Manager) go to ZMI
        * you users don't know nothing about TAL and python, and commonly want only to add static
          links to the site
        * your additional tab don't need advanced features like condition for being seen, or permissions
        
        When you don't need this
        ------------------------
        
        If you only need to port into Plone the "*portal_action*" tool customization, you will find
        a great product in `quintagroup.plonetabs`__

        How to use
        ==========
        
        First note
        ----------
        
        This product only manage portal tabs that are not automatically generated from Plone. For this
        reason, a warning message is displayed if the "*Automatically generate tabs*" option is selected
        in the "*Navigation settings*" panel.
        
        Handling tabs
        -------------
        
        From the "*Site Setup*" panel, go to the new "*Manage portal tabs*" link you'll find after the
        product installation.
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/collective.portaltabs-0.1.0a-1.png
           :alt: View of the Site Setup panel
        
        The "*Portal Tabs settings*" view is composed by two section; the first one for make changes to
        existing tabs (and also order and delete them), and the second for adding new tabs.

           :alt: Manage portal tabs panel view
        
        Newly created tab only need two kind of information: the name of the tab to be displayed (title)
        and the URL. When creating a tab you can also handle the id of the tab, or this will be
        automatically generated.
        
        What I can write inside an URL section?
        ---------------------------------------
        
        The product try to hide some of the too-technical feature you have available in the ZMI
        portal_actions tool management, however all features are still there.
        
        * to create a link to something, just type the link (e.g: "http://foo.org")
        * TAL espression are still available, but you need to start them with a "*tal:*"
        * inside an URL, you can still use expressions in the normal form "${foo1/foo2/...}"
        
        Manage additional actions categories
        ------------------------------------
        
        You can use collective.portaltabs to handle also others than "*portal_tabs*". To do this you
        need to go to ZMI, in the "*portal_properties*" tool and change the "*portaltabs_settings*".
        
        In the "*manageable_categories*" you can add additional entries::
        
            portal_tabs|Portal tabs
            foo_tabs|My special tabs 
        
        All entries are if the form "actions_id|Title to be displayed" and the *action_id*
        action category *must* be exists.
        Going back to the "*Portal Tabs settings*" make possible to handle also those new actions

        Upload directly an "actions.xml" file
        =====================================
        
        If you have defined your anc portal tabs using a *Generic Setup* profile, you can upload your ``actions.xml``
        (or compatible file) file directly in the manage form.
        
        Plone is an helephant, remember all
        -----------------------------------
        
        Please, remember that if you used an ``actions.xml`` in one of your product, Plone will remember all action you have
        loaded, and changes done manually later will be reverted if you reinstall it.
        
        To make Plone stopping remember about those actions, you need to:
        
        * uninstall your product that added the actions
        * remote the products from the ``portal_quickinstaller`` ("Contents" tab)
        * remove the ``actions.xml`` file from your product
        * install again
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Simplify creation of tabs that simply are links to site contents
        * Make possible for non-Manager users to handle tabs
        * Block users from creating TAL/Python expression if you don't want
        * Tests
