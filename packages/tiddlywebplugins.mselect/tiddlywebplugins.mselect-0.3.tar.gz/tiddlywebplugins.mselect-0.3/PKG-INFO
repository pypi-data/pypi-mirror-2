Description: 
        This is a TiddlyWeb plugin which extends the TiddlyWeb filter syntax
        to add 'mselect' which provides multiple selects in one selection. The
        following example will select those tiddlers which have tag blog OR tag
        published and then sort by modified time:
        
        mselect=tag:blog,tag:published;sort=-modified
