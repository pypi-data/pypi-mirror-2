repoze.who integration example
==============================

This example demonstrates:

* Handling authentication against a custom user "database" using repoze.who.
* Using repoze.who to load additional information about the authenticated user.
* Protecting a resource (/secret) from anonymous access.
* Login/logout.
* Passing the authenticated user's identity to the templates to allow templates
  to adapt the UI.


Main points of interest:

Most, if not all, of the repoze.who-specific code is in example/who.py. The
repoze.who middleware configuration is in who.ini.

The repoze.who middleware is configured in example/wsgiapp.py. It's after the
basic environ setup to allow it to see the WSGI environ for database
configuration etc, and before the actual application so the middleware can
intercept "401 Unauthorized" errors.

The Templating class in example/lib/templating.py adds the repoze.who identity
to the template args so the templates can display user information and adapt
the UI where appropriate.

Because the /secret resource is protected from unauthorized access all of its
children (if it had any) would be protected too.

The "user database" is a stupid dict of information to keep the example simple
but could easily be a full database, a file on disk, or a call to a remote
system.
