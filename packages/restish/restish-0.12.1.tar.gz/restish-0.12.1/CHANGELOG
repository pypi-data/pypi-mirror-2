Changelog

0.12.1 (2011-03-16)
-------------------

* Updated CHANGELOG for 0.12.x release.

0.12 (never released, see also 0.12.1)
--------------------------------------

* Bad 'Accept' headers are now sanitized.
* Default HEAD implementation now forwards to a returned resource.
* 'Accept' match order fixed for latest mimeparse (mimeparse >= 0.1.13 now
  required).
* Improved tests and coverage.

0.11 (2010-04-27)
-----------------

* Raise useful error message when templating has not been configured.
* Support additonal headers in restish.http redirect funcs.
* Improved paster-generated projects.
* Remove setuptools dependency for those that prefer distribute.


0.10 (2010-02-17)
-----------------

* Fixed serious bug that caused Resource's request handlers to leak into other
  Resources.
* Added default HEAD implementation (calls GET, discards content) with ability
  for Resource subclasses to specialise when necessary.
* Fixed http.created signature. If there's a body there has to be a content
  type header too. [INCOMPATIBLE]
* Extend the @resource.GET et al decorators so they can be used on functions
  (i.e. not methods) to benefit from request method checking and content
  negotiation checking.
* Extend the @templating.page decorator to allow the decorated methods to
  return just the args (a dict) or a (headers, args) tuple.
* Fix "method not allowed" response when the Resource has no handlers for the
  request's method.
* Add support for resources that are WSGI applications.
* Added unittest setup to paster template.
* Start using WebTest in unittests for improved response validation and simpler
  testing.
* Improvements to "python setup.py test".
* Minor Python 2.4/2.6 compatability changes.


0.9 (2009-04-21)
----------------

* Allow a response to be returned during URL traversal, i.e. as the result of a
  @child-decorated method.
* Replaced copy of mimeparse with an external dependency to the mimeparse
  package.
* Fixed @child decorator to match static, unicode strings.
* Add setup-app entry point for newly generated paster template projects.
* Add test suite location to setup.py so "python setup.py test" just works.


0.8 (2009-03-02)
----------------

* Rewrote/refactored restish.templating to be more flexible, less weird ;-) and
  to make resources need no direct relation to an application's lib.templating
  module. WARNING: backwards incompatible change ... sorry.
* Extract render_page, render_response and render_element from templating
  decorators allowing greater control over the response when the decorator's
  convenience gets in the way.
* Performance improvments: restish's Request and Response objects now directly
  subclass webob's classes avoiding lots of getattr() calls; restish.app now
  uses the PATH_INFO from the WSGI environ instead of creating a number of URL
  instances to work out the same thing.
* Added Request.application_path as a convenience for getting the path part of
  the application's root URL.
* Added the ApplicationURLAccessor contrib util, an attempt to make it easy for
  an application to define and create its fixed/canonical URLs.
* Added Tempita templating renderer "contrib" module.


0.7.2 (2009-02-17)
------------------

* Fix @child matching so it passes unquoted, decoded URL segments to the
  decorated method.


0.7.1 (2009-02-12)
------------------

* Fix to work with WebOb 0.9.6.


0.7 (2009-01-22)
----------------

* Python 2.4 compatability (thanks to Chuck Thier for the patch).
* Fix templating.Renderer to call the intance's method rather a module-scope
  function.
* Extend a renderer's signature to include the output encoding; only
  Renderer.page() sets the encoding by default. This change makes it easier to
  build a page form fragments without causing unicode decode errors.
* Changed paster template to be explicit about path to public resources. (Makes
  it work correctly with Spawning.)
* Use WebError for the paster template's error handing. It's prettier.


0.6 (2009-01-13)
----------------

* Changing the path (child, parent, sibling, etc) of a URL now removes the
  query string and fragment.
* Add a set of server error response factories/exceptions to restish.http,
  similar to those that already existed for client errors.

0.5.2 (2009-01-08)
------------------

* setup.py now specifies zip_safe=False to make it work correctly with the 
  "paster create" command.

0.5.1 (2009-01-06)
------------------

Cleaned up repo

* Added files recommended by pypi including license

0.5 (2009-01-05)
----------------

NOTE: First External Release
