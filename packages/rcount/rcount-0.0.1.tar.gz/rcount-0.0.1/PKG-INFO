        =======
        
        Redis-powered counting, comparing, and ranking. It is Part One of a planned trilogy of thin Redis abstraction modules.
        
        rcount is a small abstraction layer over Redis, focused on an abstract counter object. A counter does one thing: it keeps a count. You can increase or decrease the count, and return the value of the counter. Then, you can use your counter objects to do comparisons (which is bigger? by how much? are they equal?) and do rankings (order the counters by their associated integer size).
