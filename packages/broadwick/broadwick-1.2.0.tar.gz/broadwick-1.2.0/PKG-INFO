Description: =========
        Broadwick
        =========
        
        Broadwick is a simple python stack designed for business applications
        and business process management. Almost all of Broadwick is built upon
        the Twisted framework. 
        
        Comprises:
        
        * broadwick.messaging : Messaging abstraction. Currently contains
          twisted STOMP implementation.  
        
        * broadwick.web : A CherryPy?-like web framework built upon
          twisted.web 
        
        * examples : messaging examples (including a simple STOMP broker) and web
          examples
        
        Most of broadwick is platform-independent EXCEPT the appserver
        module. The appserver module uses supervisor (http://supervisord.org)
        which only runs on Unix, to manage processes. If anyone knows of a
        similar Windows-based process manager, an adaptor could be
        written. We're not looking into this though.
