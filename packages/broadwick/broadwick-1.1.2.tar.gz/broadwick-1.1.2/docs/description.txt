Broadwick
=========

Broadwick is a simple python stack designed for business applications
and business process management. Almost all of Broadwick is built upon
the Twisted framework. 

Comprises:

* broadwick.messaging : Messaging abstraction. Currently contains
  twisted STOMP implementation.  

* broadwick.web : A CherryPy?-like web framework built upon
  twisted.web 

* examples : messaging examples (including a simple STOMP broker) and web
  examples

Most of broadwick is platform-independent EXCEPT the appserver
module. The appserver module uses supervisor (http://supervisord.org)
which only runs on Unix, to manage processes. If anyone knows of a
similar Windows-based process manager, an adaptor could be
written. We're not looking into this though.
