X set up service mock so we can tweak & test without using API calls
X provide a helper for recipient sources to iterate over their instances' settings
X cache client objects on the ZODB connection

infrastructure:
X create z3c.suds
X create collective.cicero
X integration test
X make sure it only shows up if installed

data details:
X fail gracefully if address can't be mapped
X handle timeouts, connection errors
X deal properly with the case where the returned e-mail is a web form
X double-check what district types are available
X support limiting lookups to a particular set of states
X make sure required fields are required

scalability:
X do lookup asynchronously to avoid conflict errors due to long cicero calls (at least when JS is available)
X cache results to avoid unnecessary API calls (see collective.googleanalytics)
- support pre-geocoding via Google or Yahoo so we can take advantage of the free API offer?


Notes where Cicero docs are out of date:
- Street addresses with Suite/Apt #s seems to work okay
- Incomplete list of district types
