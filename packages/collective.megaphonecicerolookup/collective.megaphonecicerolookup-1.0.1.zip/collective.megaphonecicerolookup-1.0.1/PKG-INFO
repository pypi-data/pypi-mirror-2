Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Azavea_'s `Cicero API`_ can be used to look up the elected officials
        for a given address. ``collective.megaphonecicerolookup`` integrates this
        functionality with the Megaphone_ online advocacy tool, so that recipients
        of Megaphone letters and petitions can be found via a Cicero lookup based
        on the address entered by the user.
        
        .. Note::
        If Cicero returns an e-mail address for the official, Megaphone can
        deliver the message directly.  However, some officials only publicize
        web forms for accepting messages. In this case, Megaphone will record
        the letter but can't deliver it.
        
        Megaphone will also record but not deliver the letter if it is unable
        to find an elected official for the given address (if data is unavailable
        for the given address or if Cicero cannot be reached.)

        Installation
        ============
        
        ``collective.megaphonecicerolookup`` has been tested with Plone 4.
        
        Adding to buildout
        ------------------
        
        ``collective.megaphonecicerolookup`` has several dependencies. These should get
        pulled in automatically if you add the collective.megaphonecicerolookup egg to your
        buildout. _However_, you need to make sure that you get versions of the
        dependencies that are compatible with your version of Plone. To do so, you may
        extend the following known good set of version pins::
        
        [buildout]
        extends = http://good-py.appspot.com/release/collective.megaphone/2.1?plone=4.0.1
        
        [instance]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.megaphonecicerolookup
        
        Of course, you may need to adjust the specified Plone version, or create a
        derivative set of version pins if the ones in this set conflict with those
        recommended for some other add-on.
        
        Activating the add-on
        ---------------------
        
        After running buildout and starting your Zope instance, install
        collective.megaphonecicerolookup via the Add-ons control panel in Plone
        Site Setup.
        
        Now go to the ``Configuration registry`` control panel and configure your
        Cicero API username and password.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        1. Add a new Megaphone Action. Select the 'letter' type and continue through
        the wizard. (Megaphone petitions do not have specific recipients.)
        2. When you reach the Recipients step of the wizard, click the ``Add Recipient``
        button.
        3. If ``collective.megaphonecicerolookup`` is correctly installed, you can now
        choose to add a recipient of the ``Cicero lookup: address to official`` type.
        4. Configure the lookup by specifying the label that will be shown to the user
        sending a letter and the type of official you want to look up.
        
        You may optionally specify a set of states for which lookups will be
        performed. If you do so and the user chooses a different state, their letter
        will be recorded but without a specific recipient.  If you leave this option
        blank, lookups will always be attempted.
