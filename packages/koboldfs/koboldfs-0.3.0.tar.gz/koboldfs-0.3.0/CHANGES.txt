0.3.0 (2010-04-01)
------------------

- Removed the koboldfs.zope module and related dependencies; the same
  functionality can be achieved using koboldfs.client.ClientPool, without
  depending on any zope package.

- Introduced koboldfs.client.TransactionalClientPool, which supports
  (optionally two-phase) transactions.

- Use SQLAlchemy instead of directly depending on psycopg2 for the database
  connection; koboldfs is now (virtually) compatible with any database back-end
  which is supported by SQLAlchemy.

- Added init scripts using buildout.

- Added unit tests using sqlite as database back-end.

0.2.2 (2009-07-05)
------------------

- Fixes in the Data Manager: use the connection pool instead of always keeping
  a database connection open.

0.2.1 (2009-05-28)
------------------

- koboldfs.zope is an extra package now.

0.2.0 (2009-05-28)
------------------

- First public release.
