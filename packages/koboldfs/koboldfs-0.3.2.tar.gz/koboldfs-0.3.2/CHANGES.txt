0.3.2 (2011-01-13)
------------------

- Added the method "client.put_stat(key, source)" to the client; it works like
  the put method, but instead of a boolean it returns None in case of error,
  and a dictionary {'digest': ..., 'size': ...} in case of success.

0.3.1 (2011-01-10)
------------------

- Require SQLAlchemy >= 0.6; this fixes some corner-cases in the UTF-8 encoding
  of data retrieved from the database; updated the models to the new syntax of
  SQLAlchemy.

- Added support for parsing of ini files.

0.3.0 (2010-04-01)
------------------

- Removed the koboldfs.zope module and related dependencies; the same
  functionality can be achieved using koboldfs.client.ClientPool, without
  depending on any zope package.

- Introduced koboldfs.client.TransactionalClientPool, which supports
  (optionally two-phase) transactions.

- Use SQLAlchemy instead of directly depending on psycopg2 for the database
  connection; koboldfs is now (virtually) compatible with any database back-end
  which is supported by SQLAlchemy.

- Added init scripts using buildout.

- Added unit tests using sqlite as database back-end.

0.2.2 (2009-07-05)
------------------

- Fixes in the Data Manager: use the connection pool instead of always keeping
  a database connection open.

0.2.1 (2009-05-28)
------------------

- koboldfs.zope is an extra package now.

0.2.0 (2009-05-28)
------------------

- First public release.
