Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.geo.kml provides KML views for georeferenced objects, allowing Plone containers and collections to be visualized in Google Earth.
        
        It also provides a map view to Plone Folder and Topic content types to display kml data.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2 (2010-10-31)
        ----------------
        * Removed zgeo.kml dependency
        * Removed Large Plone Folder configurations
        * Added ability to select what content properties to display either in the
        Control Panel or on a per-content basis.  Properties can be changed at will
        and likewise reordered as required.
        [rockdj]
        * Display a Collection's saved rich text on the KML view, if it exists.
        [rockdj]
        * Retrieve default customised styles from those set in the site's control
        panel.
        [rockdj]
        * Moved the link to the given content in the KML view to be the title.
        [rockdj]
        * Added further unit tests to test the KML document view (in conjunction with
        testing customised styles)
        [rockdj]
        * Added ability to display custom styles for content in the KML-openlayers
        view, with the styles managed through the relevant annotation.
        [rockdj]
        * Added standard above-content elements to the KML-openlayers view
        (byline, description, etc).
        [rockdj]
        * Updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to handle the case of
        accessing the KML-openlayers view directly.
        [rockdj]
        * Changed KML links to content to point to the content's *View* action
        if their portal type is set that way in the Site Properties.  This
        follows in the same manner as views like the Folder Summary View.
        [rockdj]
        * Added *dc* object to BrainPlacemark to allow access to original
        content item in KML view.  This allows direct access to the content's
        methods and properties (eg for image display, see below)
        [rockdj]
        * Allowed KML feature/placemark description to display image thumbnail
        if the content possesses such (eg Images and News Items).  Images are
        displayed in same style as that of the Folder Summary View.
        [rockdj]
        * Added extra metadata into KML feature/placemark output (item type,
        modification date, creation date)
        [rockdj]
        * Changed KML output to exclude feature/placemark description tag
        on no content description being present.
        [rockdj]
        * Added uninstall GenericSetup profile
        [rockdj]
        * Added action for downloading KML to desktop (for Google Earth or
        other applications)
        [rockdj]
        * Added ability to set marker image size in control panel
        [rockdj]
        * Allowed for marker image not have to be in the hard-coded /img/ directory.
        This allows for custom markers to be specified anywhere in Plone.
        img/marker.png is set as default to keep things the same.
        [rockdj]
        * Changed linewidth to be able to accept float values.
        [rockdj]
        * Integrated zgeo.plone.kml package.
        * Updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to use the current URL's
        context to access @@kml-document.  Accessing this in a relative manner
        represents problems for URLs being rewritten in a proxy (eg Deliverance).
        [rockdj]
        * Renamed Kml Layer
