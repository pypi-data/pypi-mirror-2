2.8.0rc5
========

* Fixed a critical issue where an image would be attempted restored at
  every request. [malthe]

* Fixed an issue where the AT tool for scaling images would pass a
  unicode file path which would result in a bug because the code was
  only looking for a regular string (else deciding that it's a stream
  object). [malthe]

* Fixed an issue with HTTP range leading to a missing file size. With
  some clients (seen in Firefox 3.6), the ``end`` value is trivial and
  must be explicitly set to the file size before returning the
  iterator. [malthe]

2.8.0rc4
========

Plone 4 support

* "from Globals import InitializeClass" <- "from App.class_init ..." closes
  deprecation warning.

* AT moved from Zope2 style to Zope3 style interfaces since the old Zope 2
  "Interfaces" package has gone away with Zope 2.12. We have a workaround that
  supports both styles.
  [glenfant]

* (Deprecated) tabindex removed from all templates.
  [glenfant]

* Added a view for content items that allows managers to see where in the file
  system the fields are stored.
  [glenfant]

2.8.0rc3
========

* Change the behaviour of upload on fss. No more memory consuption for that
  now. We use always use fileiterator when inspecting big file. To achieve to
  that, VirtualDate override _read_data of OFS.Image.File to construct an clean
  FSSPdata.
  [yboussard]

* Monkey patching with collective.monkeypatcher. All monkey patches should be
  made that way.
  [glenfant]

* Using z3c.autoniclude when available.
  [glenfant]

* Change behaviour of VirtualData class. Now VirtualData work as OFS.image ie to
  acces data you MUST pass by a chained list (FSSPdata) that contain only a
  block of data. This block of data is getting by a filestream iterator. So no
  more memmory consuption (max 65536 , a block of data). This is an important
  change because when Products.Archetype.Field.FileField get metatada of a File
  old version of fss get all file data for this (ie myField.getFilename() -> you
  have your all data in memory !!). Also when you invoke
  Field.download(instance, no_output = True) you get now a filestream iterator
  (There is a patch to this method because of dowload must set content-length
  header for the publisher)
  [yboussard]

* fix content_type retreving for migration process.
  [yboussard]

=======

2.8.0a3
=======

* Fixed a NameError in migrations that could not be raised by unit tests.
  [glenfant]

2.8.0a2
=======

  image.tag().
  [b_mathieu]

  [b_mathieu]

* Test case for FSS registration.
  [glenfant]

* Hint in README.txt to set FSS storage only if iw.fss is installed.
  [glenfant]

* The ZMI "Overview" tab shows the various types changed to use FSS.
  [glenfant]

* I18N domain is now "iw.fss" being consistent with new styles
  components.
  [glenfant]

* Translations moved to zope 3 style in place of PTS style. As a
  consequence, the config panel title is not translated any more
  ("plone" domain).
  [glenfant]

* Public function to patch a type and registering patched types
  for migration purposes
  [glenfant]

* Renamed flat2directory.py into strategymigrator.py since future
  other strategy migrations will go there.
  [glenfant]

  FSS.
  [glenfant]

2.6.2 - 2007/12/07
==================

* Fixed range header processing: if one range - specific file stream
  iterator if multiple range - OFS.image traitment (1680760
  sourceforge tracker) Add some unit test to test range header

2.6.1 - 2007/10/29

* Changed in depth the way we configure FSS with the ZConfig
  way. Changing the storage and backup path, and the storage strategy
  TTW is disabled [glenfant]

  using a 'flat' storage strategy in a storage filled using a
  'directory' strategy)

2.5.4 - 2007/03/13
==================

* Fix a bug on Plone 2.5 when moving a folder containing items using
  FSS storage. Those items were losing their FSS content. (CL)

2.5.3 - 2007/02/12
==================

* Don't monkey patch BaseObject __bobo_traverse__ under Plone 2.5, but
