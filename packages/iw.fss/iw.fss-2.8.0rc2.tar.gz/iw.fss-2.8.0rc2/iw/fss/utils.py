## Upgrade steps decorator

# *not* installed in the site, and let the Manager execute these
# upgrade steps. This is somehow harmful. While this bug is not fixed,
# this safety belt will prevent managers executing the exposed upgrade
# steps.
# See https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8507
# Usage:
#
#  @IfInstalled('Collage')
#  def someUpgradeScript(setuptool):
#      # Usual upgrade script
