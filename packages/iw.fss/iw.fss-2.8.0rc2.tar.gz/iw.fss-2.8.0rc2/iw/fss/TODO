Pending issues and future features

Issues
######

* Fix CMFEditions support for strategies site1 and site2

* Fix migration unit tests (they work only for the first strategy in
  the list of tests, wharever's the order).

Features
########

* Include migration script "Original storage -> FSS". See ATCT2FSS in
  the collective reposo. https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ATCT2FSS/
  Note that the migration script may use the zcml.patchedTypesRegistry.

* Include migration script "FSS -> original storage" to provide iw.fss
  removal support.

* Add checksum to be sure files are not corrupted on filesystem.

* The "storage-strategy" should be mandatory and not implicitely
  "flat" in plone-filesystemstorage.conf.

* Deprecate the "flat" storage strategy (may be removed in FSS 2.8 or
  2.9).


Code cleanup and refactoring
############################

* Is Extensions.toolbox useful?

* Testcase: we don't need test types any more for unit tests since we
  can load "atct.zcml" in tests fixures, then use ATFile and ATImage
  contents in test cases.
