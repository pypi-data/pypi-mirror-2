=====

* Monkey patching with collective.monkeypatcher. All monkey patches should be
  made that way.
  [glenfant]

* Using z3c.autoniclude when available.
  [glenfant]

* Change behaviour of VirtualData class. Now VirtualData work as OFS.image ie to
  acces data you MUST pass by a chained list (FSSPdata) that contain only a
  block of data. This block of data is getting by a filestream iterator. So no
  more memmory consuption (max 65536 , a block of data). This is an important
  change because when Products.Archetype.Field.FileField get metatada of a File
  old version of fss get all file data for this (ie myField.getFilename() -> you
  have your all data in memory !!). Also when you invoke
  Field.download(instance, no_output = True) you get now a filestream iterator
  (There is a patch to this method because of dowload must set content-length
  header for the publisher)

  for migration purposes
  [glenfant]

* Renamed flat2directory.py into strategymigrator.py since future

  TTW is disabled [glenfant]

2.5.5 - 2007/06/13
==================

* Make FSS works when calling _setUID method on an AT object (CL)

* Add a strategy mark in the storage in a '.strategy' file such we
  could forbid strategy changes of storages at Zope startup. (i.e.,
  using a 'flat' storage strategy in a storage filled using a
  'directory' strategy)

2.5.4 - 2007/03/13
==================

* Fix a bug on Plone 2.5 when moving a folder containing items using
