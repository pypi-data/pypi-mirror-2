        About FileSystemStorage
        #######################
        
        FileSystemStorage (FSS) is an Archetypes storage for storing fields
        raw values on the file system. This storage is used to avoid
        unnecessary growth of the ZODB's FileStorage (Data.fs) when using a
        lot of large files.
        
        Please note that FSS is a Plone component for **content types
        developers**. Do not expect anything more in your Plone site if you
        don't use Plone components that may use FSS, such as AttachmentField_.

        Requirements
        ############
        
        * `Plone 3.0+ bundle <http://plone.org/>`_
        
        
        Upgrading
        #########
        
        From FSS 2.5.x and older
        ========================
        
        The way we configure the storage and backup paths as well as the
        storage strategies **HAVE CHANGED IN DEPTH**. There's no automatic
        migration from this version. Please create a configuration file that
        clones your old configlet preferences as indicated in `FSS main
        configuration`_.
        
        From iw.fss 2.7.1
        =================
        
        From this version and later version, iw.fss registers upgrade steps in
        GenericSetup. When upgrading to a newer version of iw.fss, just have a
        look at the "Upgrade" tab of the portal_setup tool in your Plone site.
        
        Warning, due to the removal of the `portal_fss` tool upgrading from 2.7.1 does
        not retain the RDF options (activated and specific script). If you used RDF with
        2.7.1, you need to redo the same RDF setting in the FileSystemStorage config
        panel.
        
        Installation
        ############
        
        With buildout
        =============
        
        This example speaks of itself::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        iw.fss
        ...
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        iw.fss
        iw.fss-meta
        ...
        
        You may also use the `iw.recipe.fss`_ recipe egg to configure fully an
        instance.
        
        
        From SVN reposo
        ===============
        
        * Inflate iw.fss package into your zope instance lib/python directory.
        I'm sure it's already done.
        
        * Add `$INSTANCE_HOME/etc/package-includes/iw.fss-meta.zcml` file with
        this line::
        
        <include package="iw.fss" file="meta.zcml"/>
        
        * Add `$INSTANCE_HOME/etc/package-includes/iw.fss-configure.zcml` file
        with this line::
        
        <include package="iw.fss" />
        
        Configuring your Plone sites
        ============================
        
        * **Read carefully** `Storage strategies`_ and `FSS main
        configuration`_ below and configure your instance in
        `plone-filesystemstorage.conf` accordingly. You may use the
        `iw.recipe.fss`_ recipe in your `buildout.cfg` to do this.
        
        * Start your Zope instance
        
        * In ZMI, go into your plone site and install the product using
        portal_quickinstaller
        
        * Optionally, tweak some - self explained - preferences in the
        FileSystemStorage configuration panel of your Plone site.
        
        
        Storage strategies
        ##################
        
        A storage strategy defines how field values will be stored in your
        files system.
        
        
        Strategies overview
        ===================
        
        FSS comes with 4 storage strategies. Each strategy requires two directories:
        
        * The storage directory stores the values of relevant fields in files
        according to the selected strategy.
        * The backup directory that keeps the values of the fields of deleted
        contents for "Undo" purpose.
        * Only one storage strategy can be selected on a given Plone site,
        but different Plone site in the same Zope instance may have distinct
        storage strategies.
        * You need the best performances: choose the `Flat storage strategy`_
        or `Directory storage strategy`_.
        * You need a storage that looks like your Plone site (in example to
        publish the storage directory in a read only samba or NFS share):
        choose the `Site storage strategy 1`_ or the `Site storage strategy 2`_.
        * If you care about CMFEdition support (means that one of the content
        types using FSS is versioned with CMFEditions), you should *not* use
        the `Site storage strategy 1`_ or the `Site storage strategy 2`_.
        
        See `FSS main configuration`_ to configure the best suited strategy on
        your Zope instance and Plone sites.
        
        
        Flat storage strategy
        =====================
        
        All field values are stored in a flat structure. This strategy is the
        default one.
        
        * Filename of these stored values: `<uid of content>_<field name>`
        * Filename of rdf file: `<uid of content>_<field name>.rdf`
        * Filename of backup values: `<uid of content>_<field name>.bak`
        
        Rdf files are not backed up. They are automatically generated.
        
        Example of storage::
        
        fssDirectory
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_image
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_image.rdf
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_file
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_file.rdf
        
        fssBackupDirectory
        |
        |- 9efeb7638fb35f5f9b9955da3e2dbfec_file.bak
        
        
        Directory storage strategy
        ==========================
        
        All field values are stored in a directory structure. Sub directories
        are defined on two level. First level of directory uses the 2
        characters of content uid.  Second level of directory uses the 4
        characters of content uid. Backup files are stored in a flat
        structure.
        
        * Filename of these stored values: `<uid of content>_<field name>`
        * Filename of rdf file: `<uid of content>_<field name>.rdf`
        * Filename of backup values: `<uid of content>_<field name>.bak`
        
        RDF files are not backed up. They are automatically generated
        
        Example of storage::
        
        fssDirectory
        |
        |- f42
        |
        |- f42ad
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_image
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_image.rdf
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_file
        |
        |- f42ad00adb7d4580f929d734bf1ed3ab_file.rdf
        
        fssBackupDirectory
        |
        |- 9efeb7638fb35f5f9b9955da3e2dbfec_file.bak
        
        Depending in one hand on your file system performances facing a huge
        amount of files in the same directory, and in the other hand on the
        number of contents relying on FSS, you might choose this strategy or
        the `Flat storage strategy`_.
        
        
        Site storage strategy 1
        =======================
        
        All field values are stored in a directory structure mirroring
        structure of PloneSite.  Backup files are stored in a flat structure.
        
        * Filename of these stored values: Filename of field value or field
        name if not defined
        * Filename of rdf file: `<field name>.rdf`
        * Filename of backup values: `<uid of content>_<field name>.bak`
        
        Rdf files are not backed up. They are automatically generated
        
        Example of storage::
        
        fssDirectory
        |
        |- members
        |
        |- john
        |
        |- dummy-document

        |
        |- 9efeb7638fb35f5f9b9955da3e2dbfec_file.bak
        
        
        Site storage strategy 2
        =======================
        
        All field values are stored in a directory structure mirroring
        structure of PloneSite. Backup files are stored in a flat structure.
        
        * Filename of these stored values: Filename of field value or field
        name if not defined
        * Filename of rdf file: `<field filename>.rdf`
        * Filename of backup values: `<uid of content>_<field name>.bak`
        
        Rdf files are not backed up. They are automatically generated
        
        Example of storage::
        
        fssDirectory

        FSS main configuration
        ######################
        
        FSS is mainly configured the ZConfig way. At startup, the
        configuration file will be searched (in that order) in:
        
        * $INSTANCE_HOME/etc/plone-filesystemstorage.conf
        * /path/to/iw/fss/etc/plone-filesystemstorage.conf
        * /path/to/iw/fss/etc/plone-filesystemstorage.conf.in
        
        A sample working configuration in provided in this last file. It
        assumes you have $INSTANCE_HOME/var/fss_storage and
        $INSTANCE_HOME/var/fss_backup directories, both being read/write
        enabled to the user that runs the Zope process, unless Zope will raise
        an error at startup.
        
        All configuration doc you need is in `plone-filesystemstorage.conf.in`
        comments.
        
        Inconsistent configuration features raise explicit error messages at
        Zope startup.
        
        Note that we didn't include this in `zope.conf` in order to keep Zope
        2.7 and Zope 2.8 compatibility.
        
        
        Configuration panel
        ###################
        
        FSS and RDF
        ===========
        
        As mentioned above in `Storage strategies`_, FSS can optionally store
        RDF files in the back-end storage. These RDF files conform the
        `DCMES-XML standard`_ on XML expression of DublinCore elements.
        
        If you select the `Flat storage strategy`_, the RDF files may be used
        to build a files tree as close as possible of the Plone tree structure
        from the storage back-end, with the `build_fs_tree.py` utility::
        
        $ cd /path/to/iw/fss/bin
        $ python build_fs_tree.py --help
        
        
        FSS maintenance
        ===============
        
        The "Maintenance" tab of FSS configuration panel shows some statistics
        about the amount of files managed by FSS.
        
        In addition 2 additional buttons are provided:
        
        * **Update FSS files** : Cleans up the back-end storage
        directories. Files not referenced from a content object are removed.
        
        * **Update RDF files** : Builds all RDF files, in the event you chose
        to select the generetion of RDF files after having inserted relevant
        contents.
        
        
        Zope backups
        ############
        
        Of course, you need to synch your Data.fs backups with the storage
        paths backups, unless you may restore corrupted/incomplete sites.
        
        
        Caveats and pittfalls
        #####################
        
        Note that whatever's the selected strategies, **DO NEVER CHANGE ANY
        FILE IN THE STORAGE PATHS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO**, otherwise
        you'll loose your contents, your job, your money, your friends, your
        wife/husband and children.
        
        **DO NEVER CHANGE THE STRATEGY FOR A PLONE SITE ONCE THIS SITE HAS
        FIELDS STORED IN ITS FSS STORAGE PATH** unless you ran the appropriate
        strategy migrator - see `Migrating between strategies`_ otherwise
        you're loose your contents, your job, ...
        
        Thought it is possible to share the same storage path and backup path
        within various Plone sites, since you don't mind of your data in
        development sites, you should really configure FSS such each Plone
        site has its own private storage path and backup path. In cas you
        ignore this warning, **DO NEVER CLICK ANY BUTTON IN THE MAINTENANCE
        TAB OF THE FSS CONFIGURATION PANEL** otherwise you'll loose your
        contents, your job, ...
        
        Zexp exports **don't embed the associated FSS storage**. So don't move
        your Plone site within Zope instances using zexp exports unless you
        move the storage and backup directories along with the zexp file.
        
        After changing your configuration (see `FSS main configuration`_),
        always restart your Zope instance in foreground since configuration
        errors are not reported when Zope is started as daemon or Windows
        service.
        
        Developer's corner
        ##################
        
        Using FSS in your content types
        ===============================
        
        We assume that creating AT based content types is a familiar activity.
        
        When creating the schema of a content type, you usually don't mention
        the storage of your fields since AT provides a default ZODB
        storage. You can choose another storage, either another one that ships
        in the Archetypes bundle, or a third party storage like FSS.
        
        Here is a small example that doesn't need much comments::
        
        # Usual Zope/CMF/Plone/Archetypes imports
        ...
        from iw.fss.FileSystemStorage import FileSystemStorage
        ...
        my_schema = Schema((
        FileField('file',
        ...
        storage=FileSystemStorage(),
        widget=FileWidget(...)
        ),
        ...
        ))
        ...
        
        You may have a look at `examples/FSSItem.py` to see a demo content
        type using FSS. If you want to play with this content type::
        
        $ $INSTANCE_HOME/bin/zopectl stop
        $ export FSS_INSTALL_EXAMPLE_TYPES=1
        $ $INSTANCE_HOME/bin/zopectl start
        
        
        Monkey patching a third party content type
        ==========================================
        
        The Python way
        ++++++++++++++
        
        This works with any Zope version listed in the Requirements_. If you
        run a Zope 2.9 or later instance, you should prefer `The ZCML way`_.
        
        This simple example shows how to plug the ATFile standard type from
        any custom product. Let's say we're in the `__init__.py` of your
        custom product::
        
        ...
        from iw.fss import zcml as fss_utils
        from Products.ATContentTypes import atct
        ...
        fss_utils.patchATType(atct.ATFile, ['file'])
        ...
        
        The ZCML way
        ++++++++++++
        
        This works only with Zope 2.9 and up, and is the recommanded way to
        wire your AT based content types with FSS since this way hides the API
        details that may be deprecated in the future.
        
        You just need to add the "fss" namespace support and some directives
        in your "configure.zcml" like this to have the same effect as in the
        example of `The Python way`_ above::
        
        <configure
        ...
        xmlns:zcml="http://namespaces.zope.org/zcml"
        xmlns:fss="http://namespaces.ingeniweb.com/filesystemstorage"
        ...>
        ...
        <fss:typeWithFSS
        zcml:condition="installed iw.fss"
        class="Products.ATContentTypes.atct.ATFile"
        fields="file" />
        ...
        </configure>
        
        The (required) attributes of this directive are:
        
        * **class**: the dotted name of the AT based content type class.
        * **fields**: one or more (space separated) field names to wire with FSS.
        
        
        Storing Plone standard content types with FSS
        =============================================
        
        Include this ZCML element either in your instance `package-includes`
        directory or in any personal `configure.zcml` in your instance
        packages::
        
        <include package="iw.fss" file="atct.zcml" />
        
        This ZCML file wires FSS with the relevant content types that ship with Plone bundle:
        
        * File
        * Image
        * News Item
        
        
        Customize RDF info set
        ======================
        
        You can add data to the RDF info set via a FSS dedicated - and
        optional - hook.
        
        Open the FSS configuration panel and give the name of your personal
        RDF data script, let's call it `fss_custom_rdf` for this example. This
        script will add or change the RDF default data set.
        
        
        RDF script interface
        ++++++++++++++++++++
        
        The script may be in any Plone layer like `custom` or any other in the
        skins path.
        
        Such script is expected to have 4 parameters:
        
        * `name`: the name of the field
        * `instance`: the content object being processed
        * `properties`: FSS field properties mapping, depending on the type of
        field associated to FSS storage.
        * `default_rdf`: a mapping structure of the RDF data, including the
        namespaces, and the elements.
        
        Such script is expected to return an updated `default_rdf` mapping
        structure.
        
        Please read the source of classes `FSSInfo`, `FSSFileInfo` and
        `FSSImageInfo` from module `FileSystemStorage.py`, `RDFWriter` from
        module `rdf.py` for detailed information on formats of expected data.
        
        
        Simple example
        ++++++++++++++
        
        We need to add the date of RDF file generation in an element like
        this::
        
        <fss:rdf_date>2007-05-13 13:21:00</fss:rdf_date>
        
        Here's the script::
        
        ## Script (Python) "fss_custom_rdf"
        ##bind container=container
        ##bind context=context
        ##bind namespace=
        ##bind script=script
        ##bind subpath=traverse_subpath
        ##parameters=name, instance, properties, default_rdf
        ##title=
        ##
        """We add the date of RDF file generation"""
        
        rdf_args = default_rdf.copy()
        
        # Add the date of RDF generation
        new_props = []
        new_props.extend(rdf_args['field_props'])
        new_props.append({'id': 'fss:rdf_date', 'value': DateTime().ISO()})
        rdf_args['field_props'] = new_props
        
        return rdf_args
        
        
        More complex example
        ++++++++++++++++++++
        
        In this more complex (and stupid - don't do this ;) example, we remove
        the elements from `fss` namespace and simulate the standard behaviour
        for other elements (`dc` and `rdf` elements).
        
        Here's the code::
        
        ## Script (Python) "fss_custom_rdf"
        ##bind container=container
        ##bind context=context
        ##bind namespace=
        ##bind script=script
        ##bind subpath=traverse_subpath
        ##parameters=name, instance, properties, default_rdf
        ##title=
        ##
        from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName
        
        rdf_args = {}
        
        # Set RDF charset
        ptool = getToolByName(instance, 'portal_properties')
        rdf_args['charset'] = ptool.site_properties.default_charset
        
        # Set RDF namespaces
        rdf_args['namespaces'] = (
        {'id': 'xmlns:rdf', 'value': 'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'},
        {'id': 'xmlns:dc', 'value': 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'},
        {'id': 'xmlns:fss', 'value': 'http://namespace.ingeniweb.com/fss'},)
        
        # Set field url
        utool = getToolByName(instance, 'portal_url')
        portal_path = utool.getPortalObject().getPhysicalPath()
        portal_path_len = len(portal_path)
        rel_path = '/'.join(instance.getPhysicalPath()[portal_path_len:])
        fss_path = '%s/%s' % (rel_path, name)
        rdf_args['field_url'] = fss_path
        
        # Set RDF properties
        props = (
        {'id': 'dc:title', 'value': instance.title_or_id()},
        {'id': 'dc:description', 'value': instance.Description()},
        {'id': 'dc:language', 'value': instance.Language()},
        {'id': 'dc:creator', 'value': instance.Creator()},
        {'id': 'dc:date', 'value': instance.modified()},
        {'id': 'dc:format', 'value': properties.get('mimetype', 'text/plain')},
        )
        rdf_args['field_props'] = props
        
        # Returns the RDF structure
        return rdf_args
        
        
        Recommanded practices on custom RDF
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Do not change the existing elements under `fss` namespace unless the
        `bin/build_fs_tree.py` utility won't work. In other terms, do not use
        the script of the `More complex example`_.
        
        Adding or changing elements to the `dc` and `rdf` namespaces may screw up
        external utilities based on canonical `DCMES-XML standard`_.
        
        Consider adding your own namespace for your custom extra elements.
        
        Migrating from AttributeStorage or AnnotationStorage
        ####################################################
        
        We assume that, at this point, you got :
        
        * A production Plone site filled with contents which storage is supported by the
        standard AT storages (AttributeStorage or AnnotationStorage).
        
        * A development site with the **same** AT based content types (ATCT plus
        others), `iw.fss` and a ZCML setup that stores fields of some contents with
        `iw.fss`. See how to do it `The ZCML way`_ or use the `atct.zcml` file that's
        included in this package.
        
        Backup your production site
        ===========================
        
        Yes, at this early stage, we didn't test migration with lots and lots of content
        types. Only the basic OTB content types have been tested. But this should work
        with any other. Whatever, you should always backup a site before proceeding to a
        deep migration like this one.
        
        Add the `iw.fss` settings
        =========================
        
        Install `iw.fss` and the ZCML settings from your develoment site on your
        production site. Note that at this step, it's safer to deny access to the users
        (use Apache settings or whatever).
        
        Start your Zope instance in forground mode (recommanded if you want to follow
        the migration logging).
        
        Do the migration
        ================
        
        Open the FileSystemStorage configlet. Check that the main control panel reports
        the expected settings (storage paths and strategies, supported content types and
        fields).
        
        Click the "migration" tab of this control panel, check the options, and proceed
        to migrations.
        
        Pack the ZODB
        =============
        
        After a successful migration, you may pack immediately the ZODB to appreciate
        the effect of using `iw.fss`.
        
        Migrating between strategies
        ############################
        
        Use the `bin/strategymigrator.py` shell utility that ships with FSS. Get
        more info on this utility using the `--help` option.
        
        Note that only flat -> directory and directory -> flat are available
        today. Sponsorship is welcome - as indicated in `Support and
        feedback`_ - if you need other strategy migrations.

        CHANGES
        #######
        
        trunk
        =====
        
        * Change the behaviour of upload on fss. No more memory consuption for that now. We use always use fileiterator when inspecting big file. To achieve to that, VirtualDate override _read_data of OFS.Image.File to construct an clean FSSPdata.
        
        * Monkey patching with collective.monkeypatcher. All monkey patches should be
        made that way.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Using z3c.autoniclude when available.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Change behaviour of VirtualData class. Now VirtualData work as OFS.image ie to
        acces data you MUST pass by a chained list (FSSPdata) that contain only a
        block of data. This block of data is getting by a filestream iterator. So no
        more memmory consuption (max 65536 , a block of data). This is an important
        change because when Products.Archetype.Field.FileField get metatada of a File
        old version of fss get all file data for this (ie myField.getFilename() -> you
        have your all data in memory !!). Also when you invoke
        Field.download(instance, no_output = True) you get now a filestream iterator
        (There is a patch to this method because of dowload must set content-length
        header for the publisher)
        [yboussard]
        
        * fix content_type retreving for migration process.
        [yboussard]

        2.8.0rc1
        ========
        
        * Worked around (and cancel migration) when AT tries (and fails) stupidly to
        guess the charset of a binary data.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Spanish translation is up to date
        [dmunicio]
        
        2.8.0b2
        =======

        items in the log too.
        [glenfant]
        
        2.8.0b1
        =======

        * Fixed issues reported by test users.
        [glenfant]

        * Fixed a NameError in migrations that could not be raised by unit tests.
        [glenfant]
        
        2.8.0a2
        =======
        
        * Fixed an issue on optional (non "required") fields: getting an empty
        field must raise an AttributeError and not return an empty string.
        [glenfant]
        
        * ATCT settings disabled

        image.tag().
        [b_mathieu]
        
        * run tests without shell variable ZOPE_TESTCASE
        [b_mathieu]
        
        2.7.4
        =====

        * CMF skins layer removed in favour of views.
        [wid]
        
        * Add a test verifying that the storage path contains one item after

        2.7.2
        =====
        
        * Fix the bobo traverse mess: we should not honour Plone 2.5(-)
        compatibility (remove patches.py) and fix the traverse deprecation
        warning.
        [glenfant]
        
        * pyflakes everything.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Removed Plone 2.5 (and previous) compatibility.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Protect with appropriate permission ZMI views/methods.
        [glenfant]
        
        2.7.1 - 2008/03/17
        ==================
        
        * Test case for FSS registration.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Hint in README.txt to set FSS storage only if iw.fss is installed.
        [glenfant]
        
        * The ZMI "Overview" tab shows the various types changed to use FSS.
        [glenfant]
        
        * I18N domain is now "iw.fss" being consistent with new styles
        components.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Translations moved to zope 3 style in place of PTS style. As a
        consequence, the config panel title is not translated any more
        ("plone" domain).
        [glenfant]
        
        * Public function to patch a type and registering patched types
        for migration purposes
        [glenfant]
        
        * Renamed flat2directory.py into strategymigrator.py since future
        other strategy migrations will go there.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added bin/flat2directory.py that migrates "flat" strategy storage to
        "directory" strategy storage.
        [glenfant]
        
        * Added discriminator in ZCML support that warns on duplicate config
        of the same content type.
        [glenfant]
        
        
        2.7.0 - 2008/02/26
        ==================
        
        * Convert FileSystemStorage Zope 2 product to iw.fss python package
        [tarek]
        
        * Added ZCML namespace/directive to wire fields of content types with
        FSS.
        [glenfant]
        
        2.6.2 - 2007/12/07
        ==================
        
        * Fixed range header processing: if one range - specific file stream
        iterator if multiple range - OFS.image traitment (1680760
        sourceforge tracker) Add some unit test to test range header
        
        2.6.1 - 2007/10/29
        ==================
        
        * ZConfig bug that lowercases some config strings: we test path in
        lowercase too (ED)
        
        * Remove the OSError when moving file into backup
        
        * Plone 3.0 compatibility [glenfant]
        
        * Do not override Content-Disposition HTTP header if already set in

        * filestream_iterator is not "range proof". Add a new
        range_filestream_iterator to negociate Range request
        
        2.6.0 RC1 - 2007/06/15
        ======================
        
        * Changed in depth the way we configure FSS with the ZConfig
        way. Changing the storage and backup path, and the storage strategy
        TTW is disabled [glenfant]
        
        * As a consequence, changing the storage strategy doesn't require to
        hack config.py any more [glenfant]
        
        * As a consequence, each Plone site in a Zope instance can have its
        own storage strategy [glenfant]
        
        * Configuration view and README.txt view in ZMI [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed documentation issues [glenfant]
        
        * SiteStorageStrategy and SiteStorageStrategy2 didn't work under Win32
        [glenfant]
        
        * Make FSS compatible with Plone 2.0 : just rewrite some testcases
        
        2.5.6 - 2007/06/15
        ==================
        
        * When renaming a folder containing FSS content, FSSInfo attribute was
        stolen one each content of the folder. Provides a solution to avoid
        this problem (CL)
        
        2.5.5 - 2007/06/13
        ==================
        
        * Make FSS works when calling _setUID method on an AT object (CL)
        
        * Add a strategy mark in the storage in a '.strategy' file such we
        could forbid strategy changes of storages at Zope startup. (i.e.,
        using a 'flat' storage strategy in a storage filled using a
        'directory' strategy)
        
        2.5.4 - 2007/03/13
        ==================
        
        * Fix a bug on Plone 2.5 when moving a folder containing items using
        FSS storage. Those items were losing their FSS content. (CL)
        
        2.5.3 - 2007/02/12
        ==================
        
        * Don't monkey patch BaseObject __bobo_traverse__ under Plone 2.5, but
        register ITraversable adapter for this. This change is required as of
        Archetypes 1.4.1 (see AT HISTORY.txt, search '__bobo_traverse__')
        
        2.5.2 - 2006/10/27
        ==================
        
        * Fix bug on maintenance tab: update files and backup, and update RDF (ED)
        
        * Fix some renaming bugs (ED)
        
        * Extend index_html method of VirtualFile and VirtualImage to use a
        filestream iterator. FSS is now compliant with CacheFu
        
        * Fix bug in FSSTool:updateFSS - replace restoreBackup method by
        restoreValueFile
        
        * Add new strategy: SiteStorageStrategy2
        
        2.5.1 - 2006/07/28
        ==================
        
        * Check existence of backup and storage paths in configlet
        
        * Fix bug on maintenance tab
        
        2.5 - 2006/07/19
        ================
        
        * Update tests to use all strategies
        
        * Add storage strategies : FlatStorageStrategy,
        DirectoryStorageStrategy, \ SiteStorageStrategy
        
        * Patch BaseObject to make it possible to access images like this
        mysite/myobj/image or mysite/myobj/image_mini
        
        * Added a docstring on VirtualData class and subclasses. This should
        fix http://plone.org/products/atphoto/issues/28 : VirtualImage can
        be published directly by ATImage
