0.2.2 (2011-08-05)
==================

   - Fix packaging problem: Declare namespace package 'z3c'.

0.2.1 - 2007-11-13 
==================

   - Conflict detection did not work with savepoints.


0.2 - 2007-09-27
================

  - Added a way to register database specific adapters for conflict detection
    and possible re-do by the publisher.

  - Using the threadlocal strategy of sqlalchemy instead of doing that
    ourselves.

  - Added support for optimistic savepoints. This can be used, similarly to
    what happens with ZODB, to flush intermediary work without committing.

  - Provide a tighter integration with Zope's transaction mechanism. Sessions
    are now automatically associated with new objects. We rely on SQLAlchemy's
    SessionContext object which hands out a session for each thread. Your code
    rarely should never have to call `session.save(object)` now.

    One incompatible change was introduced: You can not call `getSession`
    before registering an (unnamed) engine utility first. Doing so will raise
    a ValueError.


0.1.1 - 2007-06-27
==================

  - Fixed a failing test in TRANSACTION.txt where an exception demonstrated a
    string being returned but it was a unicode string.


0.1 - never released
====================

  - This was supposed to be the first release, but we missed a broken test.
    See 0.1.1
