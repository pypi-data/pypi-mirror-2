Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        Web development can be a pain.  HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM; it's a few inches
        shy of bamboo under your fingernails.  If you have a large application with a
        few people working on it can get even worse.
        
        Django Skylark attempts to make some of this better by:
        
            * Letting you describe your pages and something else assemble it
            * Managing your media
            * Providing a thin Javascript framework for those that don't need magic
            
        Using Django Skylark
        ====================
        
        Django Skylark is a Django app.  You can install it with pip::
        
            pip install django-skylark
        
        Inside your settings.py add the following::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'skylark',
            )
        
        Documentation
