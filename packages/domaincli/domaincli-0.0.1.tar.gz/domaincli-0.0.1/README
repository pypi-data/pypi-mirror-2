== What is it ==

DomainCLI is a simple command-line interface for registering domain names:

  gdb@inferno:~$ domaincli check domaincli.com
  Checking status of domaincli.com... Available!
  gdb@inferno:~$ domaincli register domaincli.com
  ***********************************************
  * Your total comes to $12 (1 year x 1 domain) *
  ***********************************************
  Are you cool with this purchase? [Yn] y
  Trying to register asnthoeusnhoaeu.com... success!
   \--> Congatulations!  You now own domaincli.com.

== Client Installation ==

Download and run the 'domaincli' script on your machine.  Run
'easy_install stripe'.  That's it.

By default, you'll be using the domaincli.com servers to register domains, but
you're welcome to set up your own DomainCLI server instance as described below.

== Server Installation ==

Currently, the domaincli server is built on top of the internetbs.com API.  The
file server/conf.sample.yaml contains test credentials for the API, so you can
develop without doing anything special.  Copy the file server/conf.sample.yaml
to server/conf.yaml and you should be good to go (modulo dependencies).  Run
'server/bin/domaincli-server' to get started.

To run in production, you'd have to sign up for an internetbs.com API reseller
account.  It's pretty painless to do, but it does require a $65 minimum deposit
to get up and running - sorry.

== Current functionality ==

Currently one can query whether a domain is owned, purchase a domain, and set
nameservers.  All domains (currently com, info, net, org, us) are $12.

== Future directions ==

- Add automatic Route53 setup, allowing complete DNS control from the
  command-line.
- Automatically set up Google Apps For Your Domain
- Improve UI and onboarding flow (shouldn't prompt for nameservers during initial
  domain purchase, etc.)
- Tons of generic domain actions.

This project is mainly a proof-of-concept, so let me know if there are any
particularly interesting features you'd like to see developed.
