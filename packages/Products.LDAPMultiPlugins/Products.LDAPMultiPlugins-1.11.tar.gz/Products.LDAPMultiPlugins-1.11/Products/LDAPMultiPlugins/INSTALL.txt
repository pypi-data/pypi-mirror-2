=======================================
Installing the LDAPMultiPlugins Product
=======================================

This product does not require any special handling after unzipping
and untarring it in the Zope Products directory. You should do 
something like:

  $ cp LDAPMultiPlugins-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
  $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
  $ tar zxvf LDAPMultiPlugins-xyz.tgz
  <watch files being decompressed>

Windows users can use WinZip or similar, it can handle tarred 
gzip files. Make sure to move the extracted LDAPMultiPlugins 
folder to your Zope installation's lib/python/Products-folder.

That's all. Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards. You will then
be able to select the "LDAP Multi Plugin" and the "Active Directory
Multi Plugin" from the list of plugins to add when you navigate to
your PluggableAuthService-based user folder and select the "Contents" 
tab in the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).

See README.txt and DEPENDENCIES.txt for any other dependencies and 
requirements.
