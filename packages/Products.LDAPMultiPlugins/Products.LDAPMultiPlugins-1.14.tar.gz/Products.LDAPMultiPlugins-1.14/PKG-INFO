        Special features - Active Directory Multi Plugin
        ================================================
        
        Properties of the ADMultiPlugin instance:
        
        - groupid_attr - the LDAP attribute used for group ids.
        
        - grouptitle_attr - the LDAP attribute used to compose group titles.
        
        - group_class - the LDAP class of group objects.
        
        - group_recurse - boolean indicating whether to determine group
        memberships of a user by unrolling nested group relationships
        (expensive). This feature is not guaranteed to work at this moment.
        
        
        Active Directory configuration hints
        ====================================
        
        In order for groups support to work correctly, you may have to set the
        following properties. Every situation is different, but this has helped
        some people succeed:
        
        - On the "Properties" tab for the ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin, set the
        groupid_attr property to "name".
        
        - On the contained LDAPUserFolder's "Configure" tab, choose a
        property other than "objectGUID", e.g. "sAMAccountName" for the
        User ID property. To get to the LDAPUserFolder, click on the
        ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin "Content" tab.
        
        Please see README.ActiveDirectory from the LDAPUserFolder package for
        additional information.

        1.14 (2011-04-06)
        -----------------
        - Bug: When a user could not be authenticated, the plugins
        would incorrectly return a tuple (None, None) instead
        of just None as specified in the PAS IAuthenticationPlugin
        interface.
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/751247)
        
        
        1.13 (2010-11-18)
        -----------------
        - Bug: When searching for roles, make sure to consider all
        search terms.
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/656011)
        
        
        1.12 (2010-07-29)
        -----------------
        - Bug: Demangling user prefix could not deal with non-string user
        ids, which may appear in certain cases.
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586931)
        
        - Feature: Added some Sphinx documentation (backport from trunk)
        
        - Reorganisation: Move documentation text files around to conform
        to the zope.org repository policy on package layout.
        
        
        1.11 (2010-05-28)
        -----------------
        - Bug: Added GenericSetup magic to fully provide the INode interface
        for the exporter and importer classes, making it easier to nest
        within other importers.
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586500)
        
        
        1.10 (2010-05-27)
        -----------------
        - Bug: enumerateUsers returned undesired results if an exact match
        was required since LDAP searches are not case sensitive.
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/585901)
