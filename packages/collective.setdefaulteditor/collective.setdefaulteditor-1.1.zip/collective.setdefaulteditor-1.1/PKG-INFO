Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        When you install a new visual editor in your Plone Site, you can set
        ``wysiwyg_editor`` in portal_memberdata to the proper value for this
        new editor.  This only means that *new* users will get this new editor.
        To change the editor for all existing users, use this package.
        
        This makes available a browser view ``@@set-default-editor`` and
        follow the instructions.  You can choose to run this in dry-run mode
        and see how many users would be changed.  When dry run is not
        selected, details are logged to the instance log.
        
        On the same form you can also select to set the default editor for
        *new* users at the same time as changing it for existing users.

        ============
        
        I (Maurits van Rees) found the main code in an article_ by Rob
        Gietema.  He apparently got the script from Kelly Craig.  And I have
        seen the same code in a post_ to the plone-setup list by Reinout van
        Rees.  So I claim it back in defense of our family honour. ;-)
