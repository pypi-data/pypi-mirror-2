Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides z3c.form widgets for file and image upload/download,
        with the option of keeping the existing file or replacing it with a new one.
        
        The widgets will act as the default for any NamedFile, NamedBlobFile,
        NamedImage or NamedBlobImage field from the plone.namedfile package.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b4 (2010-04-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Rename nochange to action, since the field was being used to specify
        which action to take.
        [wichert]
        
        * Disabled state was being applied to the wrong tag (span instead of the
        input) for images and files, and we're not using tabindex anymore.

        1.0b3 (2010-01-25)
        ------------------
        
        * Fix bug where fields that failed validation for requiredness mistakenly
        interpret the empty FileUpload in the request as a real value.
        [davisagli]
        
        * Fix bug where fields were not validated for requiredness or field constraints.
        [davisagli]
        
        * In lieu of real image scaling, at least make sure the thumbnail used on the
        image input widget has the correct aspect ratio.  Fixes
