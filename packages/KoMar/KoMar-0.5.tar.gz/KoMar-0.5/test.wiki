= KoMar - wiki-markup =

 == Philosophy ===
KoMar wiki-markup is meant to be: 
* easy to use
* easy to read
* consistent
* have enough features for everyday use

It's heavily based on
[[ http://wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0 | Creole 1.0 ]] wiki-markup,
but there are some differences.


 == Syntax =
 
  === Text formatting
You can use: **bold text**, //italics text//, ~~strikethrough~~, 
^^superscript^^, ,,subscript,, and ``code snippets``. Inline elements
can be **combined //with each ~~other~~//**. Formatting **extends
between line breaks**. But unclosed formatting //does **not** leak...

...between block elements (paragraphs, list items, block quotes, etc).

((---|extremely small)), ((--|very small)), ((-|small)), ((+|large)), 
((++|very large)), ((+++|extremely large)) text is also possible. 
You can even change ((red|foreground)), ((/yellow|background))
or even ((+++ #991a22/#AAA|colors and size!)). 



  === Links
You can use links like this [[http://google.com/]] or with description
[[ http://google.com | Google]] (use **|** between url and description,
you can even use formatting inside description like this: 
[[http://google.com | G**o**,,g,,//l//^^e^^]]. \\
Multiline descriptions are also supported: [[http://google.com |
This is a link to google with
very long description!]]

Free links like http://google.com are not recognized, 
you must use \[[ and \]]! 
Creating anchors is on the TODO list.


  === Images
To insert image use {{http://www.google.pl/intl/en_com/images/logo_plain.png}}
You can also add ALT text for images: {{ /invalid.jpg | INVALID url!}}  

It is possible to use image as link description\\ [[ http://google.com |
{{http://www.google.pl/intl/en_com/images/logo_plain.png | Google}}]]
  
  
  === Block elements

   ==== Headers
Just start the line with = for <h1>, == for <h2> and so on, up to <h6>.
Closing ='s are not displayed and can be omited.
   
   
   ==== Paragraph
Paragraphs are created automatically. You can use multiple
lines
when
writing
a paragraph. 
If you want to create new paragraph just put...
      
...blank line after the previous one. Using \\ you can create linebreak.
It doesn't matter if linebreak is on the end of line\\
or in \\ the middle of the line.

>>] This is right aligned paragraph: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut 
labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud 
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

[<<] This is left aligned paragraph: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut 
labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud 
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

><]This is centered paragraph: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut 
labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud 
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

[<>]This is justified paragraph: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut 
labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud 
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.


   ==== List
* You can use unordered lists
    * to nest the list just indent asterisk
    * if you want you can use
      multiline list items or use \\ linebreak
        # you can mix unordered and ordered lists
        # you can even add preformatted text inside list item like
{{{
this 

**not bold!***
}}}
and continue the list item here
        * or mix both list types on the same indent level
    * you can use **formatting** like in ^^normal^^ text
# and unclosed //formatting
# won't leak to the next list item
# you **can't** nest blockquote inside list item.
   
   
   ==== Blockquote
> Just start the line with > to create the **blockquote**, ot workd just 
> like quotes in the //e-mail// client. 
> 
> You don't have to put > at the beginning of the line if you want to
write multiline blockquote. Put a blank line to end it.

> You can also 
>> nest blockquote 
(even multiline) inside
> another blockquote element.
> * lists
>   # works
>   # well
> * in blockquotes
> 
> {{{
 as well as
 |    |
 +----+
 |    |
 preformatted text
}}}
and here the last paragraph of this blockquote.
   
   ==== Preformatted text
If you start the line with:
{{{
Text will be put inside <pre> tag
    This means that all the linebreaks and whitespaces are preserved.
   Also no **formatting** //will// ^^be^^ ,,used,, (or \**escaping)
 * lists
 * and
> blockquotes
Will not be created

If you want to end preformatted text use:
}}}
Further text will be treated as paragraph.
   
   ==== Horizontal line
Horizontal line can be created by using four or more hyphens in a line
 ----- 
Horizontal lines, like blank lines and headers will close all previous
block elements.
  
  
  === Escape character and inline nowiki
To escape formatting, linebreak use \** \// \,, \^^ \~~ \\\
\[[http://google.com]]

You can use {{{inline **nowiki**}}}, {{{{{{ **test** }}}}}} if you don't 
want wiki markup to be parsed. It {{{**can** //be// used across many
lines ^^just^^ ,,like,, here}}}.

\----

\= It's not a header! =


 === HTML
It is not possible to use HTML inside KoMar wiki-markup. 

>, < and & are changed to &gt;, &lt; and &amp;


== Known bugs:
 * problems with inline no wiki containing \]], \)) inside links and images


== TODO:
There are still some features to be implemented:
 * tables
 * video embedding 
 * anchors <a name="foo" /> [[:foo]] [[:foo|bar]]
 * defining language in <pre> {{{:css
 * #title - title, #more, #! - comment &arr; \&arr;
