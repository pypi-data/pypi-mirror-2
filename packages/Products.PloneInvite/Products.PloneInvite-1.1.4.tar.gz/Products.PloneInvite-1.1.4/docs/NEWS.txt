CHANGES
=======

1.1.4 (2010-05-05)
------------------

- Bugfix: Members with permission "PloneInvite: Generate Portal Invites" can
  now view user_invites (refs http://plone.org/products/plone-invite/issues/2)
- Bugfix: user_invites now only displays "Days" field if user has permission to
  set PloneInvite's tool "days" property. This would cause an "unauthorized"
  error in invite_codes.cpy if non-priviliged members tried to generate 
  invites. (refs http://plone.org/products/plone-invite/issues/2)
- Add a user action link to user_invites for non-Manager members that can 
  generate invitations. Also added nl and de translations. (refs 
  http://plone.org/products/plone-invite/issues/2)

1.1.3 (2010-01-18)
------------------

- Added German (de) translation, thanks to Hartmut Goebel
- Added some of Hartmut's ideas for extra features to TODO
- Added a bit of doc about "Customizing who can delegate invitation codes to
  users"

1.1.2 (2010-01-04)
------------------

- Fixed bug with import of unused 'INVITE_EMAIL' variable from config.py
- remove setting of site property for PloneInvite email address

1.1.1 (2010-01-04)
------------------

- Fixed bug where invitation email's sender address was left empty
- Add property 'plone_invite_sender_addres' to tool to use instead
  of site's 'email_from_addres'.


1.1 (2009-12-01)
----------------

Plone 3 compatibility fixes.

- Breaks compatibility with Plone 2.5, due to @@authenticator, which is called
  from the join_form in Plone 3, isn't available in Plone 2.5.

- Renamed permissions from "PortalInvite: ..." to "PloneInvite: ...".

- Minor modifications so it works under Plone 3, most notably encode e-mail
  before sending

- Enabled self-registration ('Add portal member' permission on the site), which
  is needed to enable new members to register themselves. (Self-registration is
  protected by the validation on the join_form, so people will only be able to
  register with an invitation code.)

- Disabled info@yoursite.com as default value, use site-wide
  email_from_address as default. (Still customizable through config.py)

- Disable overriding of mailhost settings. (Install.py used to reset the
  portal's mailhost settings to localhost:25)

- Turn on invitation generation for new users by default (5 invitations), this
  is probably what most sites want. Should be configurable in Plone product
  settings configlet.

- Disable bare try-except blocks in invite.cpy

- Translations:
  
  - Added PloneInvite.pot and plone.pot

  - Added Makefile for easy creation and updating of translation (.po) files

  - Added Dutch translation

- Fixed a bug in the user_invites template table, which showed only the invites
  which did not have enforce_address set.

- Fixed bug in Extensions/Install.py which added two 'invite_form' links to
  user actions.

- Added a "FakeMessageFactory" class for translations in controller scripts, 
  see fakemessagefactory.py


1.0.2 (2006-04-10)
