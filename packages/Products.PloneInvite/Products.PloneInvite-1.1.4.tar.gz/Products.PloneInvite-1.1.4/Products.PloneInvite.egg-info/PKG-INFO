        Configuration
        =============
        
        
        Customizing the invite e-mail
        -----------------------------
        
        1. Go to the ZMI
        
        2. Go to portal_skins, to plone_invite, select the
        invite_template, customize that
        
        
        Customizing the invitation sender address
        -----------------------------------------
        
        The email address which will be used as the "sender" in invite e-mails
        is the site-wide e-mail address by default. You can change it via
        "@@mail-controlpanel".
        
        If you want to use a different sender address than the site address
        
        1. Go to the ZMI
        
        2. Go to the plone_invite tool, go to the 'properties' tab, modify
        plone_invite_email_address
        
        
        Customizing who can delegate invitation codes to users
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        If you go into the ZMI and look into your portal's security settings, you'll
        find these permissions:
        
        * PloneInvite: Generate Portal Invites
        
        * PloneInvite: Invite Portal Users
        
        * PloneInvite: Invite Portal Users
        
        If you want a selected group of users to be able to give out invitations, just
        add (in the ZMI) a new Role "InvitationGivers", give this Role the permission
        "PloneInvite: Generate Portal Invites" (still in the ZMI), and create (in
        Plone) a group which has this Role, and these users should now be able to use
        the 'user_invites' form.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Tested on:
        
        - Plone 3.2.1, CMF 2.1.2, Zope 2.10.6-final
        
        - Plone 3.3b1, CMF 2.1.2, Zope 2.10.7-final
        
        - Plone 3.3.3, CMF 2.1.2, Zope 2.10.9-final
        
        
        Warning
        =======
        
        The product relies on a modification of the join_form for its
        functionality. Using the product alongside another product which also
        modifies join_form will not work.
        
        
        Upgrading
        =========
        
        1.1 / 1.1-alpha to 1.1.2 or higher
        ----------------------------------
        
        Upgrading by clicking upgrade in the plone product installer does not do a
        complete upgrade, because the tool is already installed, and will not get the
        new property "plone_invite_email_address". However, you might add this property
        manually (through the ZMI) to an already existing tool.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.1.4 (2010-05-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Bugfix: Members with permission "PloneInvite: Generate Portal Invites" can
        now view user_invites (refs http://plone.org/products/plone-invite/issues/2)
        - Bugfix: user_invites now only displays "Days" field if user has permission to
        set PloneInvite's tool "days" property. This would cause an "unauthorized"
        error in invite_codes.cpy if non-priviliged members tried to generate
        invites. (refs http://plone.org/products/plone-invite/issues/2)
        - Add a user action link to user_invites for non-Manager members that can
        generate invitations. Also added nl and de translations. (refs
        http://plone.org/products/plone-invite/issues/2)
        
        1.1.3 (2010-01-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Added German (de) translation, thanks to Hartmut Goebel
        - Added some of Hartmut's ideas for extra features to TODO
        - Added a bit of doc about "Customizing who can delegate invitation codes to
        users"
        
        1.1.2 (2010-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bug with import of unused 'INVITE_EMAIL' variable from config.py
        - remove setting of site property for PloneInvite email address
        
        1.1.1 (2010-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed bug where invitation email's sender address was left empty
        - Add property 'plone_invite_sender_addres' to tool to use instead
        of site's 'email_from_addres'.
        
        
        1.1 (2009-12-01)
        ----------------
        
        Plone 3 compatibility fixes.
        
        - Breaks compatibility with Plone 2.5, due to @@authenticator, which is called
        from the join_form in Plone 3, isn't available in Plone 2.5.
        
        - Renamed permissions from "PortalInvite: ..." to "PloneInvite: ...".
        
        - Minor modifications so it works under Plone 3, most notably encode e-mail
        before sending
        
        - Enabled self-registration ('Add portal member' permission on the site), which
        is needed to enable new members to register themselves. (Self-registration is
        protected by the validation on the join_form, so people will only be able to
        register with an invitation code.)
        
        - Disabled info@yoursite.com as default value, use site-wide
        email_from_address as default. (Still customizable through config.py)
        
        - Disable overriding of mailhost settings. (Install.py used to reset the
        portal's mailhost settings to localhost:25)
        
        - Turn on invitation generation for new users by default (5 invitations), this
        is probably what most sites want. Should be configurable in Plone product
        settings configlet.
        
        - Disable bare try-except blocks in invite.cpy
        
        - Translations:
        
        - Added PloneInvite.pot and plone.pot
        
        - Added Makefile for easy creation and updating of translation (.po) files
        
        - Added Dutch translation
        
        - Fixed a bug in the user_invites template table, which showed only the invites
        which did not have enforce_address set.
        
        - Fixed bug in Extensions/Install.py which added two 'invite_form' links to
        user actions.
        
        - Added a "FakeMessageFactory" class for translations in controller scripts,
        see fakemessagefactory.py
        
        
        1.0.2 (2006-04-10)
        ------------------
        
        First public release.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Test/fix expiration functionality (invitation expires after configurable
        time period).
        
        - Allow modification of invitiations e-mail "Sender" in configlet (currently
        through ZMI).
        
        - Modify configlet to enable modification of number of invites to give new
        users. (default is 5)
        
        - Do not lose invitations when re-installing.
        Actually, re-installing doesn't lose invitations, but uninstalling does: it
        removes the plone_invite tool (which contains the invitations).
        So we're looking for another place to store invitations, which doesn't get
        deleted on uninstall (making the uninstall less clean, but whatever).
        
        - Allow specified users or groups to have "infinite" invitations.
        
        - When inviting a user, it should be possible to put him into groups (at least
        if the inviter is a Manager). Thus a Manager could invite a new user directly
        into a certain group (which defines the access rights).
        
        - Do not generate invitations when delegating them, but store only the number
        of invitations a user has left. Then generate the invite code on demand when
        the invitation is sent. Used invitation codes will still be stored as they
        are now.
        
        - Code cleanup and improvements:
        * Use getToolByName instead of relying on Acquisition in:
        - send_invite_codes.cpy
        * Import permissions by name in PloneInvite.py
