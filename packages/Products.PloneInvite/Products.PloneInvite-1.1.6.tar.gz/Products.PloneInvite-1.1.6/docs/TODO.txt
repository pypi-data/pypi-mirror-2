TODO
====

- Test/fix expiration functionality (invitation expires after configurable
  time period).

- Allow modification of invitiations e-mail "Sender" in configlet (currently
  through ZMI).

- Modify configlet to enable modification of number of invites to give new
  users. (default is 5) 

- Do not lose invitations when re-installing. 
  Actually, re-installing doesn't lose invitations, but uninstalling does: it
  removes the plone_invite tool (which contains the invitations).
  So we're looking for another place to store invitations, which doesn't get
  deleted on uninstall (making the uninstall less clean, but whatever).

- Allow specified users or groups to have "infinite" invitations.

- When inviting a user, it should be possible to put him into groups (at least
  if the inviter is a Manager). Thus a Manager could invite a new user directly
  into a certain group (which defines the access rights).

- Do not generate invitations when delegating them, but store only the number
  of invitations a user has left. Then generate the invite code on demand when
  the invitation is sent. Used invitation codes will still be stored as they
  are now.

- Code cleanup and improvements:
    * Use getToolByName instead of relying on Acquisition in:
      - send_invite_codes.cpy
    * Import permissions by name in PloneInvite.py
