Description: praekelt.recipe.deploy
        ======================
        **Buildout recipe making versioned remote deploys trivial.**
           
        Creates a ``bin/`` script with which you can easily deploy buildouts to remote servers. Uses `Fabric <http://fabfile.org>`_ to communicate and run commands on remote servers.
        
        **NOTE: This recipe is under active development and has not been fully tested in a production environment. Use at your own risk.**
            
        The deploy process proceeds as follows:
        
        #. The remote host as specified in ``host`` is accessed.
        #. A new release path structure is created using this pattern: ``<root_path>/releases/<release_timestamp>``.
        #. The git repo as specified in ``git_url`` is cloned.
        #. The newly cloned repo's branch is switched to the branch as specified in ``git_branch``. If ``git_branch`` is not specified no switch occurs.
        #. Shared resources as specified in ``shared_resources`` are copied from the current release(if present) to the newly created release.
        #. The Buildout's ``boostrap.py`` is run using the python executable as specified in ``python_exec`` and a Buildout configuration file as specified in ``conf_file``. ``python`` is used by default if ``python_exec`` is not specified, ``buildout.cfg`` is used by default if ``conf_file`` is not specified.
        #. The Buildout is run using a Buildout configuration file as specified in ``conf_file``. ``buildout.cfg`` is used by default if ``conf_file`` is not specified.
        #. The ``<root_path>/current`` symlink is updated to point to newly created release.
        #. Supervisor is updated(``$ supervisorctl update``) if ``update_supervisor`` is specified as ``True``.
        #. Each command specified in ``initd_commands`` is run in order.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add a part in ``buildout.cfg`` like so::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = deploy
            
            [deploy]
            recipe = praekelt.recipe.deploy
            git_url = git@github.com:me/projectx.git
            host = www.protectx.com
            root_path = /var/www/projectx
        
        Running the buildout will add a deploy script with the same name as your deploy part in the ``bin/`` directory. In this case ``bin/deploy``. The resulting script will deploy ``git@github.com:me/projectx.git`` to ``www.projectx.com``'s ``/var/www/projectx`` path.
        
        Options
        -------
        **as_user**
            User as which to perform the deploy. Used to setup permissions appropriately and to clone from github. **Defaults to 'www-data'.**
        **conf_file**
            Buildout cfg file with which to run boostrap and buildout. **Defaults to 'buildout.cfg'.**
        **cron_commands**
            Commands to add to the ``as_users`` user's crontab.
        **deploy_key_path**
            Path on host to key to use when cloning the repo.
        **git_branch**
            Git repo branch with which to perform the deploy.
        **git_url**
            Git repo with which to perform the deploy. **Required.**
        **host**
            Hostname on which to perform deploy. **Required.**
        **initd_commands**
            init.d commands to run after a completed deploy. i.e. ``nginx restart``.
        **python_exec**
            Python command with which to boostrap Buildout. **Defaults to 'python'.**
        **root_path**
            Root path in which to perform the deploy. current/release path structure will be created within this path. **Required.**
        **shared_resources**
            Resource paths to copy accross from the current release to the new release on each deploy.
        **update_supervisor**
            Whether or not to update supervisor. **Defaults to 'False'.**
        
        Full Example
        ------------
        
        The following example illustrates all available options::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = deploy
        
            [deploy]
            recipe = praekelt.recipe.deploy
            as_user = www-data
            conf_file = production.cfg
            deploy_key_path = /var/www/.ssh/projectx_deploy_key
            git_branch = production
            git_url = git@github.com:me/projectx.git
            host = www.protectx.com
            initd_commands = nginx restart
            python_exec = python2.5
            root_path = /var/www/projectx
            shared_resources = 
                eggs
                downloads
                log
                media
            update_supervisor = True
            cron_commands = * * * * * echo foobar
            
        The resulting script will deploy ``git@github.com:me/projectx.git``'s ``production`` branch  to ``www.projectx.com``'s ``/var/www/projectx`` path as user ``www-data``. The git repo will be cloned using ``/var/www/.ssh/projectx_deploy_key`` as ssh key. The ``eggs``, ``downloads``, ``log`` and ``media`` paths will be copied from the current release to this new release. The buildout environment will be created using ``python2.5`` and run using ``production.cfg`` as configuration file. After the buildout completes supervisor will be updated and ``/etc/init.d/nginx restart`` will be run. ``* * * * * echo foobar`` will be added to ``www-data`` user's crontab.
