Description: This package implements an ESI Processor as a WSGI middeware. It is primarily
        aimed at development environments to simulate the production ESI Processor.
        
        The relevant specifications and documents are:
        - http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang
        - http://www.akamai.com/dl/technical_publications/esi_faq.pdf
        
        Completeness
        ------------
        
        This implementation currently only implements <esi:include>.
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        Realistically, under standard Python, WSGI middleware is synchronous. For an
        ESI Processor to reach very high levels of performance, it is probably
        necessary for it to be asynchronous. That probably puts an upper limit on the
        perfomance of this middleware.
        
        However, depending on the situation, it may be performant enough.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        >>> from wesgi import MiddleWare
        >>> from wsgiref.simple_server import demo_app
        
        To use it in it's default configuration for a development server:
        
        >>> app = MiddleWare(demo_app)
        
        To simulate an Akamai Production environment:
        
        >>> app = MiddleWare(demo_app, policy='akamai')
        
        To simulate an Akamai Production environment with "chase redirect" turned on:
        
        >>> from wesgi import AkamaiPolicy
        >>> policy = AkamaiPolicy()
        >>> policy.chase_redirect = True
        >>> app = MiddleWare(demo_app, policy=policy)
        
        If you wish to use it for a production server, it's advisable to turn debug
        mode off:
        
        >>> app = MiddleWare(demo_app, debug=False)
