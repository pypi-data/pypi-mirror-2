Description: 
        vt102 implements a subset of the vt102 specification (the subset that should be
        most useful for use in software). Two classes: `stream`, which parses the 
        command stream and dispatches events for commands, and `screen` which, when
        used with a `stream` maintains a buffer of strings representing the screen of a
        terminal.
        
        Why would you ever want to use this?
        
            * Screen scraping.
            * Cheating at nethack (I swear to god I will ascend)
            * Chicks dig terminals, and err... VT?
        
        Here's a quick example:
        
        >>> from vt102 import screen, stream
        >>> st = stream()
        >>> sc = screen((10, 10))
        ["          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          "]
        >>> sc.attach(st)
        >>> st.process("Text goes here")
        >>> repr(sc)
        ["Text goes ",
         "here      ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          "]
        >>> st.process("\x1b[H\x1b[K")
        >>> repr(sc)
        ["          ",
         "here      ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          ",
         "          "]
