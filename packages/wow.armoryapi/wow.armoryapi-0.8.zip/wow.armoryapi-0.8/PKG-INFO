        Introduction
        ============
        
        The armory-API is a modified version of the armorypy @ http://code.google.com/p/armorypy/.
        
        The additional info you can get from it:
        
        - Primary & secondary spec with name and icon (to build a icon link with wowhead or wow-europe)
        - Major and minor glyphs for the active spec with name, type and effect
        - 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arenateams with name, rating and ranking
        - Secondary professions (cooking, fishing etc.) with name and value
        - Prefix titles, such as Private, Twilight Vanquisher etc.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To use the API, just do an import like this
        
        ::
        
            >>> from armory_api import Armory
        
        Mock Armory.getCharacter
        
        Returns a dictionary similar to the dictionary we would get from the API,  so 
        that this test can be used while offline
        
        ::
        
            >>> from test_armory import mocked_getCharacter
        
        Mocking the function
        
        ::
        
            >>> Armory.getCharacter = mocked_getCharacter
        
        First create an instance of the Armory object
        
        ::
        
            >>> armory = Armory()
        
        To get the character info, use getCharacter(name, realm, zone, language)
        currently only "de" and "en" are supported
        
        ::
        
            >>> raider = armory.getCharacter("Kutschurft","Azshara","EU", "en")
        
        Now you can get the info with get(<key>)
        
        ::
        
            >>> name = raider.get("name")
            >>> name == "Kutschurft"
            True
        
            >>> server = raider.get("server")
            >>> server == "Azshara"
            True
        
            >>> zone = raider.get("zone")
            >>> zone == "EU"
            True
