Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        You are a site administrator? Maybe you already saw use cases below.
        
        Use case one
        
        "Hi, I deleted an importan content created yesterday. I created it back
        but for $INTERNAL reason I need that this content seems created yesterday,
        before 02:00 P.M."
        
        -- a user
        
        Use case two
        
        "Hi, I accidentally modified an old document... or better: the change was
        needed but for $INTERNAL reason I need it seems again 'old' ad before.
        Can you restore the last modification date to January 2008?"
        
        -- another user
        
        Epilogue
        --------
        
        The collective.datehacker product add to Plone a simple new view that you (the site admin? a smart
        user? every users in the portal) can use to change two of the most untouchable date inside Plone
        contents: the **modification date** and the **creation date**.
        
        If you are trained enough, you can change those dates in few lines of code, but maybe:
        
        * you don't know how to write code
        * you are lazy
        * you don't have an account with *Manager* permissions
        * none of above, but you are sure that, sooner or later, someone will ask again for the same
        change.
        
        Also this product can be useful after some big-migration activiti to Plone. May be that you or
        your users need to be able to restore some creation/modification date after the process.
