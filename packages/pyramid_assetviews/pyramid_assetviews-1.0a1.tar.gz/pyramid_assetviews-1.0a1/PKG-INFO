Description: pyramid_assetviews is a small module that allows you to add Root-Relative 
        views to your project. This enables you to serve assets that need to be
        accessed from the root of your domain such as robots.txt or favicon.ico
        without having to setup a static media server such as nginx or lighttpd.
