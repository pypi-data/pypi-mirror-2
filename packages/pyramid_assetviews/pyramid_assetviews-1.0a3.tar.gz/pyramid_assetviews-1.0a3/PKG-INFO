Description: pyramid_assetviews is a small module that allows you to add Root-Relative 
        views to your project. This enables you to serve assets that need to be
        accessed from the root of your domain such as robots.txt or favicon.ico
        without having to setup a static media server such as nginx or lighttpd.

        - Updated the add_asset_view methods method signature to accept a filename or
          list of filenames instead of using ``*names`` argument as a catch all.
        
        - Added http_cache setting that addes Cache-Control: max-age and Expires
          headers. http_cache accepts time in seconds.  For example: http_cache=5000.
        
        - Dropped zope.interface dependency and picked up a webob dependency instead.
