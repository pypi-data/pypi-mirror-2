        Overview
        ========
        
        This recipe allows to set environment variables during the execution of a buildout.
        
        There isn't any options for this recipe: all options in the part are set as environment variables.
        
        The environment variables are set during the initialization of the ``Recipe`` instance, i.e. after 
        ``buildout.cfg`` is read but before any recipe is installed or updated.
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... parts = environment print
            ...
            ... [some-section]
            ... some-option = value2
            ...
            ... [environment]
            ... recipe = collective.recipe.environment
            ... var1 = value1
            ... var2 = ${some-section:some-option}
            ... 
            ... [print]
            ... recipe = mr.scripty
            ... install = 
            ...     ... import os
            ...     ... for var in ('var1', 'var2'):
            ...     ...     print '%s = %s' % (var, os.environ[var])
            ...     ... return []
            ... """)
        
        The `mr.scripty`_ recipe is used to print out the values of the environment variables.
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
            >>> print 'start', system(buildout) 
            start...
            var1 = value1
            var2 = value2
