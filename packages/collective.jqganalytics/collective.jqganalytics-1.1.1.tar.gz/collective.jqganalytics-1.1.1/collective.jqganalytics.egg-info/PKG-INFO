Description: Introduction
        ================
        
        collective.jqganalytics uses the `jQuery Google Analytics plugin <http://aktagon.com/projects/jquery/google-analytics>`_
        to load Google Analytics asynchronously by default.
        
        Custom Variables
        ================
        
        Google Analytics tracking now provides for setting at most 5 user variables.
        These can be managed through the control panel in Plone under the 'Google
        Analytics settings' tab. There is no limit on the number of variables that can
        be set in the control panel since they can be disabled or optionally disabled
        using an expression. In the end though, the last one that is set for each slot
        is the one that will end up getting sent to Google for that slot. The name and
        value for the variables are both TALES expressions with the normal context
        variables (`context`,`here`,`request`, etc) available for use. For a complete
        list, see `Products.CMFCore.Expression.createExprContext`.
