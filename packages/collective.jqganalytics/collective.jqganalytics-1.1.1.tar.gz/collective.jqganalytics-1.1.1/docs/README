Introduction
================

collective.jqganalytics uses the `jQuery Google Analytics plugin <http://aktagon.com/projects/jquery/google-analytics>`_
to load Google Analytics asynchronously by default.

Custom Variables
================

Google Analytics tracking now provides for setting at most 5 user variables. 
These can be managed through the control panel in Plone under the 'Google 
Analytics settings' tab. There is no limit on the number of variables that can 
be set in the control panel since they can be disabled or optionally disabled 
using an expression. In the end though, the last one that is set for each slot 
is the one that will end up getting sent to Google for that slot. The name and 
value for the variables are both TALES expressions with the normal context 
variables (`context`,`here`,`request`, etc) available for use. For a complete 
list, see `Products.CMFCore.Expression.createExprContext`.
