Changelog
=========

0.6 - 2010-11-20
----------------

- In ``collective.skinny.content.Content``, add
  ``allow_fallback_to_plone_views`` variable to control whether or not
  we should allow fallback to the default Plone views.  If you set
  this to False, you can control the types that'll be visible in your
  public skin.

- In ``collective.skinny.main.Main``, render media content inline.

- Add ``language`` method for getting current language's code to Main view.

- Add ``instance`` in the call to ViewPageTemplateFile instance.  This
  makes skinny incompatible with Zope 2.11 and lower, and fixes this
  problem with more recent versions of Zope::

    Module collective.skinny.base, line 27, in render_template
    TypeError: __call__() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)

0.5 - 2009-04-20
----------------

- Allow any non-HTML resources from Plone to be served.  The previous
  "no leak" fix turned out to be a bit too strict, e.g. it wouldn't
  allow images from content to be served in the public skin.

- Patch site_properties to return the empty list for
  ``typesUseViewActionInListings`` so that images and files don't get
  a ``/view`` at the end when looking at the public skin, and thus can
  be skinned with Skinny.  To make you own view for images, add a
  ``templates/content/image.pt``.

0.4 - 2009-04-16
----------------

- Don't leak Plone views like ``folder_listing`` anymore in the public
  skin.

0.3 - 2009-01-26
----------------

- No longer require ``python:`` statements for rendering parts; use
  ``view/render_$part``.

- Make portal tools available through ``view/portal_url`` and the
  like.

- Add a ``render_viewlet`` convenience function to ``base.py`` that
  allows the reuse of Plone's viewlets in the public skin.  Look at
  ``main.MyNavigation`` for a usage example.

0.2 - 2009-01-22
----------------

- Instead of displaying the login form when an Unauthorized error is
  raised, display a 404 page in the public skin.  This will make pages
  like ``/edit`` invisible.

0.1 - 2009-01-22
----------------

- Initial release
