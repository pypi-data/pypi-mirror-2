Description: 
              Dependency Injection Toolkit.
        
              Enables easy dependency injection and declarative configuration for
              Python projects. While inspired by projects such as Spring Framework
              or Ruby's DIM, it is designed to be unobtrusive. It doesn't require
              modification in your business code to be employed; it can just be used in
              the outer layer, where configuration is actually needed.
        
              Small additional tools to help with configuration management are provided
              and can be used when and where are really fit.
