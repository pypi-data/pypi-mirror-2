# ^^^ sh and bash won't work for this because ${*} below would incorrectly
# turns arguments with spaces into multiple arguments.
# There could be a fix, but just using zsh is easier.

# Starts a process in a while 1 loop; it is just like `looper` except it
# stops after getting a non-zero exit code from the child process.  (Due
# to the -e in the shebang line above.)

# Sample usage:
# looper ls -l
# looper python script.py --some-args
