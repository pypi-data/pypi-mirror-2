Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product allows the display of content with *lead images* within
        a Collage environment, in a Plone site.  
        
        The typical *Summary* view for a Folder or a Collection only displays 
        images for News Items, the only default type that images can be assigned 
        to.  This package uses the existing 'Folder lead-image view' provided by
        collective.contentleadimage and displays the content within a Collage.  Both
        Folders and Collections (Topics) can have this new Collage view applied to
        them.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Install this product using Buildout, or a similar method, and then start up
        your Plone instance.  The ZCML configuration will automatically get picked up
        and register these additional views for your Collage content.  
        
        You should install ``collective.contentleadimage`` on your site in order for
        these Collage views to be useful.  Assigning some lead images to content will
        also be necessary use these views to their potential.
