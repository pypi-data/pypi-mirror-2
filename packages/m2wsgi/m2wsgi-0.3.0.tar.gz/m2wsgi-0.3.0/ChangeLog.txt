v0.3.0

    * New method Connection.shutdown() to stop receiving more requests,
      but allow processing of any that are already received.
    * Much improved custom request protocol with clean shutdown:
          * socket type changed from from REQ to XREQ.
          * helper renamed from pull2queue => devices.pull2xreq
          * handler now sends an explicit shutdown message to the socket.
          * socket can push requests to the handler asynchronously.
    * WSGIHandler._shutdown() now waits for all in-progress requests to
      complete before it terminates the server.
    * Add experimental gevent IO module
    * Install command-line script "m2wsgi".

v0.2.0

    * Transparent support for streaming reads of large request bodies.
    * Support for a REQ-based handler protocol as an alternative to
      mongrel2's standard PULL-based protocol.  See m2wsgi/pull2qeue.py.
    * And of course, many bugfixes and WSGI compatability improvements.

v0.1.0

    * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
