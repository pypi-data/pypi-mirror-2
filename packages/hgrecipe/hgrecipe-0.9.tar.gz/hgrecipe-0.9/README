hgrecipe
========

A Buildout recipe for pulling a Mercurial repository.

This is a fork of the MercurialRecipe package with an additional feature.

On a version update or configuration tweak Buildout is greedy, sometimes
uninstalling and reinstalling parts you don't want it to. Being on the
receiving end of Buildout trashing an existing repository because of it
can be painful. This recipe adds an ``overwrite`` option which, when set
to false, ensures that Buildout will leave those repositories safe and
intact.


Example Recipe
==============

    [django-dbtemplates]
    recipe = hgrecipe
    repository = https://me@bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-dbtemplates

    [django-dbtemplates]
    recipe = hgrecipe
    repository = https://me@bitbucket.org/dont-delete-this-unless-i-say-so
    overwrite = false


Recipe Options
==============

    ``repository``
        The url of the repository to clone.

    ``location``
        The location to clone the repository to. Defaults to the Buildout
        parts directory.

    ``newest``
        Whether to pull the latest version of the repository on a Buildout.
        Value of ``true`` or ``false``. Defaults to ``true``.

    ``overwrite``
        Whether to overwrite an existing repository at the value of
        ``location`` and whether to remove repository when recipe is
        uninstalled. Defaults to ``true``.
