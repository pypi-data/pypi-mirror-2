Description: hgrecipe
        ========
        
        A Buildout recipe for pulling a Mercurial repository.
        
        This is a fork of the MercurialRecipe package with an additional feature.
        
        On a version update or configuration tweak Buildout is greedy, sometimes
        uninstalling and reinstalling parts you don't want it to. Being on the
        receiving end of Buildout trashing an existing repository because of it
        can be painful. This recipe adds an ``overwrite`` option which, when set
        to false, ensures that Buildout will leave those repositories safe and
        intact.
        
        
        Example Recipe
        ==============
        
        [django-dbtemplates]
        recipe = hgrecipe
        repository = https://me@bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-dbtemplates
        
        [django-dbtemplates]
        recipe = hgrecipe
        repository = https://me@bitbucket.org/dont-delete-this-unless-i-say-so
        overwrite = false
        
        
        Recipe Options
        ==============
        
        ``repository``
        The url of the repository to clone.
        
        ``location``
        The location to clone the repository to. Defaults to the Buildout
        parts directory.
        
        ``newest``
        Whether to pull the latest version of the repository on a Buildout.
        Value of ``true`` or ``false``. Defaults to ``true``.
        
        ``overwrite``
        Whether to overwrite an existing repository at the value of
        ``location`` and whether to remove repository when recipe is
        uninstalled. Defaults to ``true``.
