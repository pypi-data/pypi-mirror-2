        ===================
        
        This document describes django-comments-rss and how to install.
        
        About
        -----
        
        RSS found in django.contrib.comments.feeds are coming without full comment text, user link and page name where comment is posted. For this reason this project was born.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Add to application to INSTALLED_APPS in ``settings.py`` file::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_commenrs_rss',
                ...
                )
        
        Also, add to urls.py::
        
            url(r'^comments/rss/', include('django_comments_rss.urls')),
        
        I think you have line something like that for django.contrib.comments in ``urls.py`` file::
        
            url(r'^comments/', include('django.contrib.comments.urls')),
