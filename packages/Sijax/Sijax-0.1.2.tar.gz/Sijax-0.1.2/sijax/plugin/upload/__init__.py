    """Helps you easily register Upload functions with Sijax.
    
    We suggest that the `args_extra` options is passed here, so that the
    response function would receive the files object or anything else it might be
    needing to manipulate file uploads.
    By using `args_extra` you could change the response function's default header from:
        def upload_handler(obj_response, form_values)
    to:
        def upload_handler(obj_response, files, form_values)
    where the args_extra=[files] option was passed during registering.

    It's very important to keep in mind that unlike the regular
    :meth:`Sijax.register_callback` function, this one returns some javascript code
    as a response. You need to execute that code on the page that contains the
    form you want to transform to Sijax upload.

    :param sijax_instance: the :class:`Sijax` instance to register callbacks with
    :param form_id: the id of the form as it appears in the DOM
    :param callback: the function that would get called to process the upload request
    :param options: options to pass to :meth:`Sijax.register_callback`
    :return: string - javascript code you need to put on your page,
                      to make your form use Sijax when submitted
