        ======
        Baruwa (swahili for letter or mail) is a web 2.0 `MailScanner <http://www.mailscanner.info/>`_
        front-end.
        
        It provides an easy to use interface for managing a MailScanner installation. It is used to
        perform operations such as releasing quarantined messages, spam learning, whitelisting and
        blacklisting addresses, monitoring the health of the services etc. Baruwa is implemented
        using web 2.0 features (AJAX) where deemed fit, graphing is also implemented on the client
        side using SVG, Silverlight or VML. Baruwa has full support for i18n, letting you support
        any language of your choosing.
        
        It includes reporting functionality with an easy to use query builder, results can be
        displayed as message lists or graphed as colorful and pretty interactive graphs.
        
        Custom MailScanner modules are provided to allow for logging of messages to the mysql
        database with SQLite as backup, managing whitelists and blacklists and managing per
        user spam check settings.
        
        Baruwa is open source software, written in Python/Perl using the Django Framework and
