Baruwa on Centos/RHEL
=====================

Install EPEL
============

The EPEL repo provides packages which are in Fedora but no yet
included in RHEL/CENTOS. Django is shipped by the EPEL repo.
Instructions on installing it can be found on `EPEL <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse>`_

Baruwa rpm install
==================

Download the rpm from `topdog-software.com <http://www.topdog-software.com/oss/baruwa/>`_,
Due to the fact that the shipped MySQLdb module shipped on 
Centos/RHEL is too old, do not install python-mysql install 
MySQLdb from source instead. 

Instructions on installing MySQLdb from source can be found 
`mydjangoblog.com <http://mydjangoblog.com/2008/04/24/deploying-and-tuning-django/>`_

Now proceed and install the dependencies::

    # yum install python-IPy python-GeoIP Django mod_wsgi

Install Baruwa::

    # rpm -Uvh --nodeps baruwa-<version>.noarch.rpm

Create the database::

    # mysql -p < /usr/share/doc/baruwa-$(rpm --qf %{VERSION} -q baruwa)/baruwa-create.sql

Create the database user::

    mysql> GRANT ALL ON baruwa.* TO baruwa@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
    mysql> flush privileges;

Create the baruwa admin user::

    # mysql baruwa -u baruwa -p
    Enter password: ******
    mysql> INSERT INTO users (username,password,fullname,type) 
    mysql> VALUES ('<username>',md5('<password>'),'<name>','A');

Configure MailScanner
=====================

:ref:`Configure <setupmailscanner>` MailScanner if you have not already done so.

Configure Baruwa
================

Edit /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/baruwa/settings.py and 
set the mysql database details::

    DATABASE_ENGINE = 'mysql'           
    DATABASE_NAME = 'baruwa'             
    DATABASE_USER = 'baruwa'             
    DATABASE_PASSWORD = '<baruwa_password>'         
    DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'            

If your MailScanner config file is not located in the standard 
location (/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf) then edit the
baruwa_settings.py file which is in the same directory as the
settings.py file and set::

    MS_CONFIG = '/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf'

**Setup Web server**

Edit your apache configurations to enable virtual hosting if
not enabled already. Then set the correct hostname in 
/etc/httpd/conf.d/baruwa.conf::

    # change to your hostname
    ServerName baruwa-alpha.local

Make sure mod_wsgi is enabled, uncomment the following line in
/etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf::

    LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
    
Restart apache and point your browser to the hostname url.
