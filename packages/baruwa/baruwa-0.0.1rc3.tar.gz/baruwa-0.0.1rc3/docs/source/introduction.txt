Introduction
============
Baruwa (swahili for letter or mail) is a `mailwatch <http://mailwatch.sf.net/>`_ inspired 
web 2.0 `MailScanner <http://www.mailscanner.info/>`_ front-end. 

It provides an easy to use interface for users to view details of messages processed by 
MailScanner as well as perform operations such as releasing quarantined messages, 
spam learning,whitelisting and blacklisting addresses etc. Baruwa has implemented web 2.0 
features (AJAX) where deemed fit, graphing is also implemented on the client side using SVG.

It also provides reporting functionality with an easy to use query builder, results can be 
displayed as message lists or graphed as colorful and pretty graphs.

Baruwa is written in Python using the Django Framework and MySQL for storage, it is released 
under the GPLv2
