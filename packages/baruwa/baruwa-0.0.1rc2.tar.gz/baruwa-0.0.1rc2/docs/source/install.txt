**Configure the Baruwa settings**

Edit the settings.py file which will be installed in the "baruwa" 
directory inside your Python's site-packages directory, which is 
located where ever your Python installation lives. Some places 
to check are:

    + /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)
    + /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    + /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages (MacOSX, Ports Python 2.4)

    DATABASE_PASSWORD = '<password>'
    DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'

If your MailScanner config file is not located in the standard 
location (/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf) then edit the
baruwa_settings.py file which is in the same directory as the
settings.py file and set::

    MS_CONFIG = '/etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf'

To the correct file name.

    Use the sample configuration provided (extras/baruwa-mod_wsgi.conf) 
    as a template. Copy to your apache configuration directory usually
    /etc/httpd/conf.d

    Make sure that your apache is configured for name based virtual
    hosting such that you can run other sites on the same box if you
    wish to.

    Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/baruwa-mod_wsgi.conf and set ServerName to
    the hostname you will use to access baruwa

    Restart apache for the configuration to take effect.::

        # /etc/init.d/httpd reload
