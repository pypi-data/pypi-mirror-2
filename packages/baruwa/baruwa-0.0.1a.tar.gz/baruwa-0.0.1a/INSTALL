INSTALL
=======
Thanks for downloading Baruwa.

To install it make sure you have the following.
    + Python >= 2.4
    + Django >= 1.1.1
    + MySQLdb >= 1.2.1p2
    + GeoIP
    + iPy
    + Apache httpd & mod_wsgi | mod_python (mod_wsgi recommended) NOTE: (You can user any other server that can run django)
    + A working mailwatch installation or you need install the database schema and MailScanner custom modules.

Then run this command from the command prompt

    python setup install

You then have to configure your web server. Sample configuration files for apache with mod_wsgi are provided
    + baruwa-mod_wsgi.conf (copy to your configurations directory usually /etc/httpd/conf.d on redhat clones)
    + src/baruwa.wsgi (installed)


Make changes to the database schema, run the following command.

    # mysql < create.sql

Configure the settings to match your Mysql server. Edit the settings.py file which will be installed
in the "baruwa" directory inside your Python's site-packages directory, which is located whereever
your Python installation lives. Some places to check are:
    
    /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)
    /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    /opt/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages (MacOSX, Ports Python 2.4)

Thats it, you can now login with your existing mailwatch username & password

==================
DISTRIBUTED SETUPS
==================
Baruwa is capable of running in a distributed setup, It uses REST to process quarantined messages residing on other
nodes, the only requirement is that the nodes share session infomation. If you are running your nodes from the same
database backend or running multi master replication then this will work out of the box.

The baruwa implementation differs from the mailwatch one in that it uses REST and the users credentials to process
the message on the other node, mailwatch uses an XML-RPC system which does not use authentication.
