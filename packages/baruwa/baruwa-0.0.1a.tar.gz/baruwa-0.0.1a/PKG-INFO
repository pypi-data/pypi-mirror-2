Description: 
        ======
        Baruwa
        ======
        Baruwa (swahili for letter or mail) is a mailwatch http://mailwatch.sf.net/ inspired
        web 2.0 MailScanner http://www.mailscanner.info/ front-end.
        
        It provides an easy to use interface for users to view details of messages processed by
        MailScanner as well as perform operations such as releasing quarantined messages,
        spam learning,whitelisting and blacklisting addresses etc. Baruwa has implemented web 2.0
        features (AJAX) where deemed fit, graphing is also implemented on the client side using SVG.
        
        It also provides reporting functionality with an easy to use query builder, results can be
        displayed as message lists or graphed as colorful and pretty graphs. The goal of the initial
        version will be to address the various quarks that exist in mailwatch at the moment. Baruwa
        will initially be a drop in replacement for mailwatch, future releases will however break
        compatibility with mailwatch. This enables easing of end users in to the new interface.
        
        Baruwa is written in Python is released under the GPLv2
