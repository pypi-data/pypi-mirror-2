        Introduction
        ------------
        This theme is aimed at making Plone compliant with the Dutch web guidelines. 
        
        Website of the Dutch web guidelines: http://www.webrichtlijnen.nl/english
        
        A description from the webrichtlijnen.nl website:
        
        ::
        
            Government bodies and companies are facing the challenge of 
            creating websites that are optimally accessible to people as 
            well as browsers and search engines. The Web Guidelines 
            aid in that process.
        
            There are internationally recognized agreements for creating 
            web sites known as 125 quality requirements standards warrants 
            a significantly better website. The Netherlands government 
            has assembled these international standards in a quality model 
            called the Web Guidelines. This quality model comprises 125 
            quality requirements for the benefit of better websites.
        
        
        This theme is tested using the Dutch web guidelines quick scan. The quick scan
        checks 47 points of 125. There 78 points in the guidelines that need manual
        checking. These manual tests involve how the website uses HTML and other relevant
        techniques, that the content manager(s) are aware of several guidelines and how
        processes supporting the guidelines are defined. In the doc dir an example is
        included for all the manual points. The document is named
        'niet_toetsbare_webrichtlijnen.odt' and is in Dutch.
        
        If you're from the Dutch central goverment you can login to see the scan results.
        Unfortunately local goverments cannot see the complete scan results, they can
        use the quick scan.
        
        Installation (short version)
        ----------------------------
        
        See below for "Full installation notes", notably the part on how to use this
        product with a custom theme.
        
        * Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                Products.PloneTableless
                collective.webrichtlijnen
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            zcml =
                ...
                Products.PloneTableless
                collective.webrichtlijnen
        
          We consciously do not use z3c.autoinclude here, because we have an
          `overrides.zcml` file here, which might conflict with any overrides you have
          defined in your own theme product, causing the server to not start.
        
        Why aim at these Dutch web guidelines and not the W3C standard?
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        All websites of the Dutch central goverment need too comply with the Dutch web
        guidelines in 2010. (http://www.webrichtlijnen.nl/english/background/). Websites
        of the local goverment (ie. municipalities) have the aim to be compliant in 2010. 
        
        
        Webrichtlijnen compliant HTML/CSS code that is marked as invalid
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        The following points are marked as invalid by the quick scan. When a manual
        check is done these points are invalid.
        
        * Invalid (R-pd.1.1): The use of a width attribute is only allowed with images, the quick scan finds a width attribute. This is not correct no width attribute is used.
        * Possible valid (R-pd.8.11): If access keys are used make sure it works on every page on the site and only use numbers. Plone follows this practice and uses a setup that closely matches most international recommendations on access keys.
        * Possible valid (R-pd.9.1): The quickscan finds an inline style tag. This is not correct no inline style is used.
        
        
        Webrichtlijnen non-compliant HTML/CSS code
        ------------------------------------------
        The following points are marked as invalid by the quick scan.
        
        * Invalid (R-pd.2.6): Plone uses CSS3 to create rounded corners. The CSS used fails when using the W3C CSS check. The use of CSS3 is complementary, where this is applied the pages are still visisble with a browser that uses CSS2.1
        * Possible invalid (R-pd.3.9): The Plone footer uses a sub element to show the copyright character. The web guidelines advised to avoid using sup (suberscript) and sub (subscript)element where possible.
        
        
        Plone versions and themes
        -------------------------
        The webrichtlijnen theme works with Plone 3 and 4. When using the webrichtlijnen
        theme the visual appearance of Plone isn't altered. The table below shows which
        default Plone theme is used as base and which webrichtlijnen theme version works
        with a specific version of Plone/

        Full installation notes
        -----------------------
        
        Prefered method for installing this theme is using buildout. 
        
        Plone 4.0 and up
        ================
        
        * Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.webrichtlijnen
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Start Zope, and in your Plone instance, install `collective.webrichtlijnen`
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        Plone 3
        =======
        
        Although the theme in this python egg is for Plone 4, here are the install
        instructions for Plone 3.
        
        * Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                Products.PloneTableless
                collective.webrichtlijnen
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                Products.PloneTableless
                collective.webrichtlijnen
                collective.webrichtlijnen-overrides
        
        * Pin down the correct version if you're using Plone 3*::
        
            [versions]
            collective.webrichtlijnen = 1.0.2 # only for Plone 3
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Start Zope, and in your Plone instance install Plone Tableless
        
        Usage with your custom theme
        ============================
        
        You will probably want to use this product with a custom theme. The recommended
        way to do this is to base your theme on `Webrichtlijnen`. That way, the skin
        layers will also be available in your theme, without having to register
        the skin layer for all themes. Here's an example `skins.xml`::
        
        
          <?xml version="1.0"?>
        
          <object name="portal_skins" allow_any="False" cookie_persistence="False"
             default_skin="My Theme">
        
           <object name="my_theme_templates"
              meta_type="Filesystem Directory View"
              directory="my.theme:skins/my_theme_templates"/>
           <skin-path name="My Theme" based-on="Webrichtlijnen">
            <layer name="my_theme_templates"
               insert-after="custom"/>
           </skin-path>
        
          </object>
