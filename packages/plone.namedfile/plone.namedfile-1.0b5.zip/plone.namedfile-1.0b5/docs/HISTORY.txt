Changelog
=========

1.0b5 - 2010-04-19
------------------

* Add support for scaled images.  See usage.txt for details.
  [davisagli]

* Fix the field schemata so they can be used as the form schema when
  adding the field using plone.schemaeditor.
  [rossp]

1.0b4 - 2009-11-17
------------------

* Avoid using the internal _current_filename() helper, which disappeared in
  ZODB 3.9.
  [optilude]

* Add field factories for plone.schemaeditor (only installed if
  plone.schemaeditor is available)
  [davisagli]

1.0b3 - 2009-10-08
------------------

* Add plone.rfc822 field marshaler (only installed if plone.rfc822 is
  available)
  [optilude]

1.0b2 - 2009-09-17
------------------

* Add plone.supermodel import/export handlers (only installed if
  plone.supermodel is available).
  [optilude]

1.0b1 - 2009-05-30
------------------

* Make z3c.blobfile (and blobs in general) a soft dependency. You'll need to
  separately depend on z3c.blobfile (and probably pin it to versio 0.1.2) to
  get the NamedBlobFile and NamedBlobImage fields. This means that
  plone.namedfile can be used with ZODB versions that do not support BLOBs.
  This policy will probably be revisited for a 2.0 release.
  [optilude]

1.0a1 - 2009-04-17
------------------

* Initial release
