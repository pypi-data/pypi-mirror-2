Ego Boost
=========

This package will do nothing less than boosting the ego of any Python developer
who has made packages available via PyPI. Finally, with one simple command and
a cronjob you can track the downloads of your packages over time. Here is a
simple example::

    $ ego-boost collect python-weewar pypi:python-weewar bb:basti/python-weewar
    Fetching data from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-weewar...
    Fetching data from http://bitbucket.org/basti/python-weewar...
    $ ego-boost export
    date,python-amazon-product-api,python-weewar
    2010-07-10,8742,2807
    2010-07-11,0,2807
    ...

Once installed, you can use binary ``ego-boost`` with the following commands:

``collect <package> URL [URL ...]``
  will collect download statistics from the provided URLs and store them under
  key ``package`` (which will later appear in the CSV data).

  You can specify any number of URLs. Supported sources so far are

  * PyPI (shortcut: ``pypi:``)
  * bitbucket.org (shortcut: ``bb:``)
  * github.com (shortcut: ``gh:``)

  Data is always stored for the current date. Subsequent data collection will
  not lead to falsely accumulated data for that day!

``export``
  will aggregate download statistics per package per date and print CSV data to
  stdout. 


Installation
============

Simply use ``pip install ego-boost`` (or ``easy_install ego-boost``). You can
also download the source from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ego-boost>`_
and run ``python setup.py install`` in the untared directory.

On one of my servers, I have installed the following cronjob that collects
download statistics for all my packages on a daily basis::

    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    0 7 * * * ego-boost collect python-weewar bb:basti/python-weewar
    0 7 * * * ego-boost collect python-weewar-monitor bb:basti/python-weewar-monitor
    0 7 * * * ego-boost collect python-amazon-product-api pypi:python-amazon-product-api

TODOs
=====

* Make code available on bitbucket (or similar).
* Some graphics would be nice!
* Support for more sources (if there is interest).

If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, improvements etc. drop me a
line!
