Description: =========
        Ego Boost
        =========
        
        This package will do nothing less than boosting the ego of any Python developer
        who has made packages available via PyPI. Finally, with one simple command and
        a cronjob you can track the downloads of your packages over time. Here is a
        simple example::
        
            $ ego-boost collect python-weewar pypi:python-weewar bb:basti/python-weewar
            Fetching data from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-weewar...
            Fetching data from http://bitbucket.org/basti/python-weewar...
            $ ego-boost dump
            date,python-amazon-product-api,python-weewar
            2010-07-10,8742,2807
            2010-07-11,0,2807
            ...
        
        The same can be achived by using the interactive console::
        
            $ ego-boost
            > collect python-weewar-monitor bb:basti/python-weewar-monitor
            Fetching data from http://bitbucket.org/basti/python-weewar-monitor...
            > quit
            Bye.
        
        Commands
        ========
        
        Once installed, you can use binary ``ego-boost`` with the following commands:
        
        ``collect PACKAGE URL [URL ...]``
          will collect download statistics from the provided URLs and store them under
          key PACKAGE (which will later appear in the CSV data).
        
          You can specify any number of URLs. Supported sources so far are
        
          * PyPI (shortcut: ``pypi:``)
          * bitbucket.org (shortcut: ``bb:``)
          * github.com (shortcut: ``gh:``)
        
          Data is always stored for the current date. Subsequent data collection will
          not lead to falsely accumulated data for that day!
        
        ``dump``
          will aggregate download statistics per package per date and print CSV data to
          stdout. 
        
        ``export FILE``
          will export all data into a single JSON file. This can later be imported 
          again. If ``FILE`` is ``-``, output will be redirected to stdout.
        
        ``import FILE [FILE ...]``
          will import one or more JSON files into the data base. Inside the interactive 
          console you can use wildcards, too.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Simply use ``pip install ego-boost`` (or ``easy_install ego-boost`` for those
        of you that still have to discover the superiority of `pip`_). You can also
        download the source from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ego-boost>`_ and
        run ``python setup.py install`` in the untared directory.
        
        On one of my servers, I have installed the following cronjob that collects
        download statistics for all my packages on a daily basis::
        
            # m h  dom mon dow   command
            0 7 * * * ego-boost collect python-weewar bb:basti/python-weewar
            0 7 * * * ego-boost collect python-weewar-monitor bb:basti/python-weewar-monitor
            0 7 * * * ego-boost collect python-amazon-product-api pypi:python-amazon-product-api
            # ...
        
        .. _pip: http://pip.openplans.org
        
        TODOs
        =====
        
        * Make code available on bitbucket (or similar).
        * Some graphics would be nice!
        * Support for more sources (if there is interest).
        * Use `cmdln <http://code.google.com/p/cmdln/`.
