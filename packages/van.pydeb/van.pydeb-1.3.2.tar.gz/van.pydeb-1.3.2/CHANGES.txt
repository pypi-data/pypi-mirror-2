Changes
=======

1.3.2 (2010-06-22)
------------------

* Conform to Zope repository policy.
* Update automatically updated list from current unstable.
* Ignore python3 packages for now in auto-generated list.

1.3.1 (2010-01-14)
------------------

* Add override for python-gettext.
* Add override for Chameleon (python-chameleon).
* Update automatically updated list from current unstable.

1.3.0 (2009-09-04)
------------------

* Add a scripts/generate script which generates a python package -> debian
  binary mapping suitable for adding to van/pydeb/py_to_bin.txt.
* Append the output of the generate script to van/pydeb/py_to_bin.txt.
* Expose _default functions for package conversions so that generate can check
  it's results and weed out extra packages that match the default conversions.
* Make python-pkg-resources the default translation for setuptools:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543551
* Add the concept of options to the list of dependencies.
* Create a "reduced" option that causes warnings to be printed when a reduced
  dependncy is used.
* Implement a --override-dep option which can be used to override python to
  binary package dependencies.

1.2.1 (2009-06-15)
------------------

* Add mapping for ZConfig and RestrictedPython.
* Change default Debian binary to python package name conversion. The original
  package name will be used if there is no python-prefix. This works with
  packages such as buildbot which do not include the python-. The previous
  version errored in this case, so we're backwards compatible :)

1.2.0 (2009-05-29)
------------------

* Improve README.txt. Thanks to Fabio Tranchitella for a better looking way of
  calling van-pydeb in the rules file.
* Expose version and package name conversion functions via the command line interface.
  e.g. This command will print out the debian binary package name::

    $ van-pydeb py_to_bin foo

1.1.0 (2009-05-26)
------------------

* Obligatory "How could I have done that" release smoothing out documentation
  bugs and making the command line options more complete.

1.0.0 (2009-05-26)
------------------

* Initial Release.
