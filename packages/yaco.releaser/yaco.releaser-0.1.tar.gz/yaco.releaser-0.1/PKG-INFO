Description: zest.releaser addon
        ===================
        
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser is collection of command-line programs to help you
        automate the task of releasing a software project which can be used for
        non-Python projects too like buildouts.
        
        yaco.releaser is a very simple extension which allow append extra text to the default commit messages.
        
        It's usefull for us because in Yaco is mandatory to mention a ticket to commit to a project.

        Installation
        ------------
        Just a simple ``easy_install yaco.releaser`` is enough.
        
        Alternatively, buildout users can install yaco.releaser as part of a
        specific project's buildout, by having a buildout configuration such as::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = releaser
        
            [releaser]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = yaco.releaser
        
        Usage
        -----
        Follow http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser documentation
        
        In the process of ``prerelease`` or ``postrealease`` you will be wondered about adding
        extra text to the commit message.
        
        **Warning**: The ``release`` (so fullrelease neither) are not supported yet, ie. you cannot add and extra
        to the message when creating the new tag.
