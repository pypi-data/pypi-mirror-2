        About GoogleSystemStorage
        -------------------------
        
        GoogleSystemStorage (GSS) is an extension of FileSystemStorage (FSS).
        
        GSS transparently to the user, saves the document types supported by the Google Docs service
        on the Google servers, while storing all the other files in the local filesystem.
        
        GSS permits Plone users to access their files from both the Plone application and their
        Google Docs account.
        
        In addition, GSS permits to overcome the problem of ZODB size growth, and the consequent
        performance penalties, when many files with large size are used.
