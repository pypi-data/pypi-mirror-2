        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed 
        product installation instructions.
                
        .. _Installing an Add-on Product: http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/third-party-products/installing
        
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing 
        ECLecture is very simple.  You can install it by adding it to the 
        eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ... 
              Products.ECLecture
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, 
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Then restart your zope instance and use the Add/Remove products page
        in Site Setup to install ECLecture.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``ECLecture`` folder of this project
        (``Products.ECLecture/Products/ECLecture``) into the ``Products`` 
        directory of the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and 
        restart the server.  Use the Add/Remove products page in Site 
        Setup to install ECLecture.

        History
        =======
        
        # Changes in release 1.4 (2011-08-10)
        
        - Added compatibility for Plone 4. Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
          Plone 3 users should use ECLecture 1.3.x.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.3.1 (2010-04-26)
        
        - Fixed issue: Plone's default view methods (folder_summary_view, 
          folder_tabular_view, and folder_listing) does not work for ECFolder.
        
        - Fixed issue: Icons for lecture resources are not shown. 
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.3 (2008-09-24)
        
        - ECLecture was completly re-implemented with support for Plone  3.x. 
          It is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style tarball 
          distribution is still available at plone.org.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.2.1 (2008-01-06)
        
        - Added Plone-3.0 compatibility / removed deprecation warnings
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.2 (2007-06-27)
        
        - Inherits from ECFolder (from the ECAssignmentBox product), if
          available.  This enables the use of ECLecture as a top-level folder
          for a course with the statistics and assignments listing functions
          from ECFolder.
        
        - Internal registration support: If you enter "ecl_register" into the
          Registration link field, ECLecture will handle registration to the
          course.  Users who want to register must be known to Plone.  You
          must also set an Associated group in ECLecture.
