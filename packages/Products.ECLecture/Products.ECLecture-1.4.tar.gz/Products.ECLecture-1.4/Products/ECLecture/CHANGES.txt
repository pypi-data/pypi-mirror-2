# Changes in release 1.4 (2011-08-10)

- Added compatibility for Plone 4. Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
  Plone 3 users should use ECLecture 1.3.x.


# Changes in release 1.3.1 (2010-04-26)

- Fixed issue: Plone's default view methods (folder_summary_view, 
  folder_tabular_view, and folder_listing) does not work for ECFolder.

- Fixed issue: Icons for lecture resources are not shown. 


# Changes in release 1.3 (2008-09-24)

- ECLecture was completly re-implemented with support for Plone  3.x. 
  It is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style tarball 
  distribution is still available at plone.org.


# Changes in release 1.2.1 (2008-01-06)

- Added Plone-3.0 compatibility / removed deprecation warnings


# Changes in release 1.2 (2007-06-27)

- Inherits from ECFolder (from the ECAssignmentBox product), if
  available.  This enables the use of ECLecture as a top-level folder
  for a course with the statistics and assignments listing functions
  from ECFolder.

- Internal registration support: If you enter "ecl_register" into the
  Registration link field, ECLecture will handle registration to the
  course.  Users who want to register must be known to Plone.  You
  must also set an Associated group in ECLecture.
