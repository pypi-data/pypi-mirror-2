<h1>Video player is missing</h1>

<p>Your video is being processed now (if not available already!). However, there's one thing missing. You need to put the player where the application can find it. Once this is done, you'll be able to watch the video.</p>

<p>To do this, please follow the instructions given in the README file.</p>

<p>Thanks <code>:-)</code></p>
