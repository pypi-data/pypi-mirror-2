PyLogAn Readme

This tool is a Log Analyzer. It is inspired by the modlogan idea of isolate input,
process and output.
It was created because of the need of a log analyzer for squid that use the
syslog lines. The only option the author find was modlogan but it is
discontinuated.
The goal was to get a good code, capable of been developed and to solve the needs
of the author that were three traffic reports: user report, domain report and
navigation (user + source ip + domain) report.
The author have almost no time to spend on it but belives that it worth the
effort, there are a lot of posibilities and maybe is good to write it here.
Here it goes...
Big ToDo:
-The need to remove a lot of indexing in favour of DOM native capabilities, just
need an easy and simple way of validation (like doc.validate() in PHP)
-Remove the abuse of dictionaries in favour of tuples and lists, there are a lot
of interfaces in output that works better with lists of tuples (to get a sort,
for example)
-The whole cosmetic job, work with the CSS to make it look pretty
-Attach the code text strings to some kind of internationalization (like i18n
maybe, don't know)
-Change all the paths build to work with the os module
-Review all the text and correct the author's poor english ;-)

Simple ToDo:
-Make the reports to work sorted
-Format the table for a better reading
-Make the table heading dinamic (now it only shows 'Usuarios')
-Extend the inline doc (__doc__)

Ideal ToDo:
-Make more reports (more processing)
-Support of detailed reports (with hyperlinks)
-Implementation of real RRD backend, with partial updates (maybe saving the file
pos in a separate file)
-Implementation of other inputs and outputs (SQL,XML,SOAP,plane text,etc.)
-Work in the bin file (use configuration file, accept parameters, etc.)
