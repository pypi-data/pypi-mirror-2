        Summary
        -------
        
        django-wsgiserver is a django app for serving Django sites via
        CherryPy's excellent, production ready, pure-python web server without needing to
        install all of Cherrypy_.  Note that Cherrypy names its server "wsgiserver" but
        it is actually a full-blown, multi-threaded http/https web server which has been
        used on production sites alone, or more often proxied behind a something like
        Apache or nginx.
        
        Uses
        ----
        The wsgiserver component has been used for years in production.  Peter
        Baumgartner noted that it solved problems for him on memory on a memory-limited
        VPS hosted site [#]_.  Performance-wise it does well: it can serve up thousands
        of requests per second [Piel2010].
        
        I have used django-wsgiserver for small production sites, though daemonized
        modwsgi_ and uwsgi_ have served me well. I use it all the time though during
        development. It's my "pocket-sized" server. completely written in python and it
        gives me an instant approximation of the final production environment I use.  In
        some ways, it's much better than the development server which is built into
        django: It gives a quick way of running an SSL for sites that require https, and
        it has no problem serving pages that do multiple ajax calls that would cause the
        built-in runserver to hang.
        
        To use django-wsgiserver, I add it to my installed apps in my project settings
        file, then do::
        
           $ manage.py runwsgiserver
        
        and reload my browser page and the problem is fixed.  It's also useful to see if
        some weird effect is being caused by runserver's process of loading the settings
        twice.
        
        This project is a slight modification of code form Peter Baumgartner code (see `Peter's
        blog post`_) Peter and others did the work of creating a management command.
        I've added a few small improvements from my point of view: It doesn't require
        installing cherrypy separately. It uses the same port as the development server
        (8000) so I don't need to re-enter my testing url in my browser, and it works by
        default with OS's like Mac OS 10.6 and Ubuntu 10.04 which prefer binding
        localhost to an ip6 address.
        
        Feature list
        ------------
        - multi-threaded production ready webserver for low to medium traffic sites
        - pure python
        - setuptools/pip installable (so install right in virtualenv)
        - small memory footprint
        - by default replaces mimics the django built-in server, serves admin media by
          default for easy testing and deployment
        - supports https/ssl  
        
        Planned features
        ----------------
        - serve static media automatically (see django 1.3 static files support)
        - improve autoreload of changed files during development
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        To get started using the server, you need nothing outside of django itself and
        the project code that you would like to serve up. However, for ssl support, you
        may need PyOpenSSL--though the new cherrypy server includes support for using the
        python built-in ssl module depending on which version of python you are using.

        Installation
        ------------
        To install, django-wsgiserver follows the usual pattern for a django python application.  You have several options
        
        1. pip install django-wsgiserver OR
        2. easy_install django-wsgiserver
        3. If you would like to use the latest possible version, you can use pip and mercurial checkout from bitbucket
        
        ::
        
           pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/cleemesser/django-wsgiserver#egg=django-wsgiserver
        
        4. Alternatively you can download the code and install it so that django_wsgiserver is on your PYTHONPATH
        
        After you used one of the methods above, you need to add django_wsgiserver to your INSTALLED_APPS in your django project's settings file
        
        Usage
        -----
        To see how to run the server as a management command, run::
        
            $ python manage.py runwsgiserver help  
            
        from within your project directory. You'll see something like what's below::
        
          Run this project in CherryPy's production quality http webserver.
          Note that it's called wsgiserver but it is actually a complete http server.
        
            runwsgiserver [options] [wsgi settings] [stop]
        
            Optional CherryPy server settings: (setting=value)
              host=HOSTNAME         hostname to listen on
        			    Defaults to 127.0.0.1,
        			    (set to 0.0.0.0 to bind all ip4 interfaces or :: for
        			    all ip6 interfaces)
              port=PORTNUM          port to listen on
        			    Defaults to 8000
              server_name=STRING    CherryPy's SERVER_NAME environ entry
        			    Defaults to localhost
              daemonize=BOOL        whether to detach from terminal
        			    Defaults to False
              pidfile=FILE          write the spawned process-id to this file
              workdir=DIRECTORY     change to this directory when daemonizing
              threads=NUMBER        Number of threads for server to use
              ssl_certificate=FILE  SSL certificate file
              ssl_private_key=FILE  SSL private key file
              server_user=STRING    user to run daemonized process
        			    Defaults to www-data
              server_group=STRING   group to daemonized process
        			    Defaults to www-data
              adminserve=True|False  Serve the django admin media automatically. Useful
                                     in development. Defaults to True so turn to False
                                     if  using in production.
        
            Examples:
              Run a "standard" CherryPy server server
        	$ manage.py runwsgiserver
        
              Run a CherryPy server on port 80
            $ manage.py runwsgiserver port=80
        
          Run a CherryPy server as a daemon and write the spawned PID in a file
            $ manage.py runwsgiserver daemonize=true pidfile=/var/run/django-cpwsgi.pid
        
              Run a CherryPy server using ssl with test certificates located in /tmp
            $ manage.py runwsgiserver ssl_certificate=/tmp/testserver.crt ssl_private_key=/tmp/testserver.key
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        If you want to use an installed version of Cherrypy--perhaps because you now have
        a more recent version, you only need to change one line of code in (around line
        177) of django_wsgiserver/management/commands/run_wsgiserver.py::
        
            from django_wsgiserver.wsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer as Server
            #from cherrypy.wsgiserver import CherryPyWSGIServer as Server
        
        Just comment out the import from django_wsgiserver.wsgiserver and uncomment the import from cherrypy.wsgiserver to make the switch. For SSL use, you need to search and replace  "django_wsigserver." back to "cherrypy."
        
        To do
        -----
        - looking at settings for serving static media automatically
        - I should probably just add a switch to allow use of the native cherrypy install
        - Upload to the cheeseshop/pypi at some point. Done!
        - Consider other server backends: tornado, uwsgi
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        - 0.6.10 add import of django.contrib.admin to address issue #5, #6
        - 0.6.9 typo fix
        - 0.6.8 Changed name of bitbucket repo to django-wsgiserver to match it's pypi name
        - 0.6.7 using open().read() in setup file broke setuptools/pip install because README.rst wasn't included. Created MANIFEST.in file and now include README.rst tests/, docs/ 
        - 0.6.6 fix up cherrypy dependency in ssl that was accidently introduced in the
          move to cherrypy.wsgiserver 3.2 branch
        - 0.6.5 added mediahandler wsgi application
        - 9/6/10 0.6.4 added code to automatically serve the admin media like the
          development server does by default. Can turn off on command line for
          production.
        
        - 9/6/10 0.6.3 - see if I can get the download to finally include all the
          packages--didn't have wsgiserver!
        
        - added test project in tests/ directory
        
        - got tired of typing run_cp_wsgiserver so did a rename so I could use
          runwsgiserver instead.
        
        - updated wsgiserver to svn r2680 (matches cherrypy version 3.2 beta+). This
          fixes some bugs and gives better python 2.6 support.  This version of cherrypy
          will also support python 3.x for whenever django starts supporting it.
        
        - use port 8000 as with django devserver rather than Cherrypy's default 8088
        
        - adapted defaults host=127.0.0.1 in order to work with ip4 by default.  This
          addresses an issue I first noticed on mac OS 10.6 and later on ubuntu 10.04
          where ip6 is active by default. Can get around this by adjusting the host
          option.  For binding all ip4 interfaces, set to 0.0.0.0. For all ip6 interfaces
          I believe you use '::' You can also bind a specific interface by specifying
          host=<specific ip address>  See http://www.cherrypy.org/ticket/711
          
        - switched code to use run_cp_wsgiserver instead of runcpserver
