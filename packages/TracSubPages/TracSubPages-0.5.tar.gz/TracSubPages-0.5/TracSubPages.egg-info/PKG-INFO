Description: Overview
        ========
        
        TracSubPages is a Trac plugin that supplies a macro allowing full wiki pages to be displayed inside of other wiki pages. This is useful if there is a piece of content (such as a contact table or log) that needs to be displayed in multiple places, as it eliminates the need for each instance of this content to be maintained.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The syntax for the subpage macro is simple::
        
        [[subpage(wiki_page, [show_link])]]
        
        Where `wiki_page` is the wiki page (No url is needed here, nor 'wiki/', just the page). The macro supports pages that aren't top-level, too ('BigCategory/SpecificSubject'). The second argument, `showlink` is an optional argument (`true` or `false`) that determines whether or not a link to edit the rendered page will be shown at the bottom of the subpage section (The link reads 'Edit Section' and provides a link directly to the edit page of the referenced wiki page). 
        
        For example, if a user had created a wiki pages called 'Minutes' and wanted to display it inline in another wiki page without a link to edit it, he or she would add the following entry to the wiki page that is intended to display the extra content::
        
        [[subpage(Minutes, False)]]
        
        If the user later decided that he or she wanted a link to be placed at the bottom of the inline section for quick editing, the entry should be changed as follows::
        
        [[subpage(Minutes)]]
        
        Note that the second boolean argument 'True' is not needed, as it is assumed by default.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
         * A wiki page needs to exist before you link to it with a subpage macro. This may seem obvious, but the error caused by a broken link isn't very descriptive (yet).
         * Please use only wiki formatting for subpages. The use of macros can (and probably will) cause errors.
