Description: clang-fake-gcc
        ==============
        
        Strip out useless arguments out of gcc calls when going for clang.
        
        This thing is especially useful for you guys who like to compile Python
        extensions in C with Clang::
        
        CC=clang-fake-gcc python setup.py build
        
        Nice, huh?
