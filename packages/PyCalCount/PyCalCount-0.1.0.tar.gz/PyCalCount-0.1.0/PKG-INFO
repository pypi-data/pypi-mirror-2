        PyCalCount
        ===========
        
        PyCalCount is a basic "calorie-counting" program.  With it, you enter food items along with their basic nutritional info (calories, total fat, sodium, protein and carbohydrates).  You can then log "meals" by combining any number of food items.::

            $ python /path/to/pycalcount.py
        
            
            -----------
            ON WINDOWS:
            -----------
            
            Open a command prompt and type:
            
            C:\path\to\python.exe C:\path\to\pycalcount.py
            
            OR
          
            Just double-click on pycalcount.py.
        
        
        
        Requirements:
        ==============
        
        * Python 2.6 or later
        
        
        
        Installation:
        ==============
        
        * In Unix:  Unpack the tarball, open a terminal, navigate to the directory in which you unpacked the tarball, and type (as admin, i.e., "su" or "sudo") ``python setup.py install``
        
        * In Windows, just run the .exe as normal.  The script will be installed to C:\\Pythondir\\Lib\\site-packages
        
        Notes
        -------------
        
        This is another work-in-progress.  While functional, it could theoretically get ugly after a week or so of use until I bother to add a "page" function.  Also, as of now, this is command-line only.  No GUI yet, and there won't be a GUI for a while yet.
        
        Check back in the future for updates.
