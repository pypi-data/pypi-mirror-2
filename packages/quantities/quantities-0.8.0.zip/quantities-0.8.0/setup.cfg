description = Support for physical quantities with units, based on the popular
	numpy library
license = BSD
author = Darren Dale
author_email = dsdale24@gmail.com
download_url = http://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantities
long_description = Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions
	of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by
	various units, and possibly an uncertainty. See the `tutorial
	<http://packages.python.org/quantities/user/tutorial.html>`_ for examples.
	Quantities builds on the popular numpy library and is designed to work with
	numpy ufuncs, many of which are already supported. Quantities is actively
	developed, and while the current features and API are stable, test coverage
	is incomplete and so the package is not suggested for production use.
