Description: Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions
        of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by
        various units, and possibly an uncertainty. See the `tutorial
        <http://packages.python.org/quantities/user/tutorial.html>`_ for examples.
        Quantities builds on the popular numpy library and is designed to work with
        numpy ufuncs, many of which are already supported. Quantities is actively
        developed, and while the current features and API are stable, test coverage
        is incomplete and so the package is not suggested for production use. See
        the tutorial_ for more information.
