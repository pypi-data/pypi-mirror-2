Description: Introduction
        ============
        
            collective.geo.file provides a view for KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
            and GPX (GPS eXchange Format) files.
            The view renders the file in a openlayers Map using the collective.geo
            library.
        
            The product does not introduce a content type but adds an additional
            view to the Archetypes file and collection type.
        
            When you upload a KML file with the
            correct mimetype 'application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml' (i.e with
            the extension *.kml) or 'application/gpx+xml' (i.e. with the extension
            *.gpx) the map view will be applied by default.
        
            For Collections an additional view is added that displays all KML and GPX files
            returned by the query as a layer. Choose 'KML File Map View' from the
            display menue of the topic.
        
            You have to register the mimetype 'application/gpx+xml' manually in
            the Plone MimeTypes Registry:
        
            # In the ZMI, go to the root of your Plone site.
            # Go into the mimetypes_registry
            # At the top of that sreen is a button to Add a New MIME type. Click that.
            # In the resulting screen, complete that form.
            # In name, enter 'GPS eXchange Format'.
            # Check 'Binary?'.
            # In mime-type, enter: 'application/gpx+xml'.
            # In Extensions, enter: 'gpx'.
            # In Globs, enter: '*.gpx'.
        
        
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
            If you assign coordinates to the file with the IGeoreferenceable Interface
            you have to set the viewletmanager to 'Do not display map' otherwise
            it will _REALLY_ screw up your view. To do this you currently have to
            use the svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.geo.*/branches/nan-viewlet-manager/
            branch of collective.geo (hopefully it will get merged into trunk
            soon) The coordinates assigned there will display as the first layer
            on the 'Map View' of the file and they will display in the
            'KML File Map View' of a topic.
