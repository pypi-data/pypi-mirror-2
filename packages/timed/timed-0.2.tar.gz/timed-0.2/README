                          a command-line time tracker.

INTRODUCTION.

    1.  Timed stays out of your way.
    2.  Timed is as simple as possible.

INSTALLATION.

    Method 1.

        $ git clone git://github.com/adeel/timed.git
        $ cd timed
        # python setup.py install

    Method 2.

        # pip install timed

USAGE.

    $ timed start myproject
    starting work on myproject
      at 16:35 on 07 Feb 2011

    $ timed
    working on myproject:
      from    16:35 on 07 Feb 2011
      to now, 17:00 on 07 Feb 2011
           => 0h25m have elapsed

    $ timed stop
    worked on myproject
      from    16:35 on 07 Feb 2011
      to now, 17:40 on 07 Feb 2011
           => 1h5m elapsed

    $ timed summary
      - myproject: 1h5m

    $ cat ~/.timed
    myproject: 16:35 on 07 Feb 2011 - 17:40 on 07 Feb 2011

Remember that ~/.timed is just a text file so the standard UNIX text processing
tools (grep et al.) are available.

COMMANDS.

    timed: alias for 'timed status'

    timed status:
           print current status

    timed start <project>:
           start tracking for <project>

    timed stop:
           stop tracking for the current project

    timed summary:
           print a summary of hours for all projects

    timed help:
           print help

BONUS.  Put the name of the active timed project in your bash prompt by
putting this in ~/.bashrc:

    function get_timed_project {
      timed status --quiet
    }

    PS1='\u@\h \$(get_timed_project) [\w] \n % '

CHANGELOG.

  0.13: Stopped using ez_setup for installation.
  0.12: YAML turned out to be pretty slow, so it's been dropped.
  0.11: Using YAML to store the log.
  0.10: First release.
