Symbian port

This was an attempt at getting PyDBGP working on the Symbian Series 60.  It
almost worked, but at the time the Symbian python port had some limitations that
prevented PyDBGP from working.  Those limitations are now gone, however work
on this has not proceeded since the first investigation into Python on Symbian.
