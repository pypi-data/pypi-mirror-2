1. What is it?
=======================================
A small tool for recursively extracting nested tar archives.

2. What is a nested tar archive?
=======================================
It is a tar archive containing other tar archives which may further
contain many more tar archives (and so on...)

3. So what does this program do?
=======================================
It extracts tar archives recursively.
It can extract the following tar archives - 
.tar, .tgz, .tbz, .tb2, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2

4. What's different in this?
=======================================
Ordinary extractors normally just extract a tar archive once, ie
they won't extract any other tar archives (if any) that are present
in it. If it has more tar archives and you want to extract them too,
then you have to yourself extract each of these archives. This can be
a real headache if there are many tar archives (and are nested many
levels deep). I have tried to make this thing easy using this tool.

5. Does it have a command line utility?
=======================================
Yes, it does. You can access it from the terminal using the command -

+---------------------------------------+
| extractnested tar1.tar [tar2.tar ...] |
+---------------------------------------+
(this is if extractnested.py is placed in one of your default paths)

OR

+-------------------------------------------------+
| /../../../extractnested tar1.tar [tar2.tar ...] |
+-------------------------------------------------+
(where /../../../extractnested is the full path to extractnested.py)

Note for linux users: To allow execution of extractnested.py as a 
bash script, you need to grant it permissions -
chmod ugo+rx extractnested.py

6. Python version?
=======================================
Python 2.6 or 2.7 (also probably prior python 2.x versions)

7. Where do I check for its updates?
=======================================
You can find updated and much more elaborated information and 
explanation on my blog -

See the CHANGELOG for changes in this version.
