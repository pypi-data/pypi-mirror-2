Description: 
        What is a nested tar archive?
        ==============================
        It is a tar archive containing other tar archives which may further
        contain many more tar archives (and so on...)
        
        So what does this program do?
        ==============================
        It extracts tar archives recursively.
        It can extract the following tar archives - 
        .tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2
        
        What's different in this?
        ==========================
        Ordinary extractors normally just extract a tar archive once, ie
        they won't extract any other tar archives (if any) that are present
        in it. If it has more tar archives and you want to extract them too,
        then you have to yourself extract each of these archives. This can be
        a real headache if there are many tar archives (and are nested many
        levels deep). I have tried to make this thing easy using this tool.
        
        How to access it from terminal?
        ==========================
        You can access it from the terminal using the command -
        extractnested.py tar1.tar [tar2.tar ...]
        
Platform: Python 2.6 or 2.7.
