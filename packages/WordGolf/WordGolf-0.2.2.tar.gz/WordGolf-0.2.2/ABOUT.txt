Word Golf is a word game inspired by a mixture of Boggle and Golf.
The idea was to have a game where you were trying to find words
but at the same time you had to think about when and how you
would use them. 

Simply adding the constraints of matching the total number of
letters creates an additional layer on top of the traditional
word finding and allows you to play the game in a number of 
different ways.


The game engine behind the game is called "serge". The original
inspiration for this engine was the Ragnarok engine.

Only a small portion of the input code remains from that engine
but the overall design was driven from experimenting with it.


Sounds for the game came from the FreeSound project.

Look in the audio directory for the original file references.


Graphics for the game were of my own making.
