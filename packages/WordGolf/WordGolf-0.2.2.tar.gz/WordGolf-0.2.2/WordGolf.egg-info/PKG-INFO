Description: Word Golf
        ---------
        
        An addictive word game based on a combination of the word game Boggle and golf.
        
        You play a series of holes and try to combine words with enough letters to make
        it to the hole. Each hole has a par so try to use as few words as possible.
        
        On the harder levels, stay away from bunkers and water traps to avoid penalty strokes.
        
        Requires: Python 2.6+ and pygame 1.9+
