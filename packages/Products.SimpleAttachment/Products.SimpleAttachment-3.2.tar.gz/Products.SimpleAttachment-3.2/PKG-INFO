Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Several Plone products have a need to handle simple attachments: content
        types that do not have a workflow of their own but will reuse the
        permissions on their container. SimpleAttachment implements simple file
        and image attachment types that can serve this need.
        
        SimpleAttachment is released under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2.
        Please see http://gnu.org for more details.
        
        Installation
        ============
