TODO
====

In priority order:

- document the PDBxx commands in Ex mode

- when switching to vimpdb from pdb, if the remote VIM is unavailable,
  log a message and keep pdb running.

- when switching to vimpdb from pdb, copy the call stack.

- when resetting, close vimpdb buffer and issue message

- try to start Vim server if it is not started

- try to guess Vim server name to avoid need of
  ``VIMPDB_SERVERNAME``

- check and complain if Vim does not support the right options

- register command to call PDB_reset_original_mapping

- add option to allow other network settings
  (instead of hardcoded)


and much more...
