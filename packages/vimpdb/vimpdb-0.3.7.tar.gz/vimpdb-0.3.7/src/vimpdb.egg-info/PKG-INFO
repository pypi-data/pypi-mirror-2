        VIM Pdb integration

        Abstract
        ========
        
        This package provides an integration of the Python debugger ``pdb`` into the
        VIM editor.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        **vimpdb** has been used successfully under Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.
        
        It **is compatible** with Python 2.6, 2.5 and 2.4. It is not known if it does work
        with Python 3.0 (let us know).
        
        **vimpdb** requires an installation of VIM that supports both ``python`` and
        ``clientserver`` options.
        
        Find out if it is the case by issuing the following command at the VIM prompt::
        
        :version
        
        If the options are supported, you will see ``+clientserver`` and ``+python`` in the
        output. In the opposite case, you will see ``-clientserver`` or ``-python``.
        
        On Linux and Windows, the default VIM build should already be server-enabled.
        
        On Windows, the ``python`` option compiled in VIM depends on a specific Python
        version. Find out if that specific version is installed and works in VIM by
        issuing the following command at the VIM prompt::
        
        :python import sys; print sys.version
        
        On Mac OSX, you'll want to use MacVIM_. MacVIM also has the ``python`` option
        compiled in by default.
        
        .. _MacVIM: http://code.google.com/p/macvim/
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just install this package using ``easy_install`` or similar::
        
        $ easy_install vimpdb
        
        If you look inside the package, you will see a VIM script file: ``vimpdb.vim``.
        Do **not** move it to VIM configuration directory (like ``~/.vim/plugin``).
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        VIM script
        ----------
        
        To communicate with the VIM instance where debugging happens,
        **vimpdb** needs to launch another VIM instance in client mode.
        
        By default, **vimpdb** uses the ``vim`` script to start that VIM instance with
        clientserver support. If there exists such a ``vim`` script on your path, you are ok.
        
        You can configure another script with the ``VIMPDB_VIMSCRIPT`` environment variable.
        It must hold the script that **vimpdb** should use to launch a VIM instance
        with clientserver support.
        
        On Windows, it should hold the path to ``vim.exe``, **not** to ``gvim.exe``.
        Furthermore, do **not** include quotes in the enviromnent variable to take care
        of whitespace in the path.
        
        Server Name
        -----------
        By default, **vimpdb** speaks to the server named ``VIMPDB``.
        Note that the default ``servername`` used by VIM is ``VIM``.
        
        If want **vimpdb** to use another server name, you need to setup the
        ``VIMPDB_SERVERNAME`` environment variable. It should hold the name of the VIM
        server you will be using for debugging.
        
        You may list the currently running VIM servers using::
        
        $ vim --serverlist
        VIM
        
        Or, on a Mac::
        
        $ /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim --serverlist
        VIM
        
        When a VIM instance with ``clientserver`` support is running, you can find its name by issuing the
        following command at the VIM prompt::
        
        :echo v:servername
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Starting VIM
        ------------
        
        To start a VIM instance for debugging, issue the following command on the shell::
        
        $ vim --servername VIMPDB
        
        Or, on a Mac, if you installed the ``mvim`` script::
        
        $ mvim --servername VIMPDB
        
        Python code
        -----------
        
        Using **vimpdb** is easy -- just insert a call to ``set_trace`` in your code
        almost as usual::
        
        import vimpdb; vimpdb.set_trace()
        
        Then start your python application/script.
        
        When the python interpreter hits that line, VIM will get the focus and
        load the source file at the right line.
        
        VIM commands
        ------------
        
        In VIM, you may now use the following commands:
        
        .. csv-table:: VimPDB Commands
        :header-rows: 1
        
        Key, Command
        n , Next
        s , Step
        a , Args
        u , Up
        d , Down
        r , Return
        c , Continue
        b , Sets a breakpoint at the line on which the cursor is sitting.
        w , Displays the value of the word on which the cursor is sitting.
        x , Switch to debugging in shell with standard Pdb.
        v , Switch back to VimPdb from plain Pdb.
        
        Standard Pdb hook
        =================
        
        If you find it hard to change habits and keep on typing
        
        ::
        
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
        
        you can add the following line to the  ``.pdbrc`` file sitting in your home
        folder::
        
        import vimpdb; vimpdb.hookPdb()
        
        This way, the command ``v(im)`` mentioned above is added to your standard Pdb
        and you can switch to **vimpdb** at any time.
        
        Known issues
        ============
        
        * No convenient way to evaluate a Python expression.

        TODO
        ====
        
        In priority order:
        
        - document the PDBxx commands in Ex mode
        
        - when switching to vimpdb from pdb, if the remote VIM is unavailable,
        log a message and keep pdb running.
        
        - when switching to vimpdb from pdb, copy the call stack.
        
        - when resetting, close vimpdb buffer and issue message
        
        - try to start Vim server if it is not started
        
        - try to guess Vim server name to avoid need of
        ``VIMPDB_SERVERNAME``
        
        - check and complain if Vim does not support the right options
        
        - register command to call PDB_reset_original_mapping
        
        - add option to allow other network settings
        (instead of hardcoded)
        
        
        and much more...
