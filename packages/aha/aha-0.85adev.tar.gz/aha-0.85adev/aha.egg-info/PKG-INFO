        Quickstart
        -----------------------
        To start playing with aha, download bootstrap from url bellow.
        
        http://aha-gae.googlecode.com/files/project.zip
        
        After extracting the archive, move to the folder you'll get and just type
        
        python bootstrap.py
        
        Next step is to launch buildout command. Make sure that you have internet connection, because it will download libraries via the internet.
        
        bin/buildout
        
        Then, launch app in local development environment. All the stuff required to run application are under app directory. So you may give 'app' argument to the command.
        
        bin/dev_appserver app
        
        Now it's time to visit your fiest aha application's screen :-). Type http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see initial page of aha's default application.
