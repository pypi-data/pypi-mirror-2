Description: 
        filecache
        
        filecache is a decorator which saves the return value of functions even
        after the interpreter dies. For example this is useful on functions that download
        and parse webpages for example. All you need to do is specify for how long
        the return values should be cached (use seconds, like time.sleep).
        
        USAGE:
        
        from filecache import filecache
        
        @filecache(24 * 60 * 60)
        def time_consuming_function(args):
            # etc
        
        
        NOTE: All arguments of the decorated function and the return value need to be
            picklable for this to work.
        
        NOTE: The cache isn't automatically cleaned, it is only overwritten. If your
            function can receive many different arguments that rarely repeat, your
            cache may forever grow. One day I might add a feature that once in every
            100validity scans the db for outdated stuff and erases.
        
        Tested on python 2.7 and 3.1
