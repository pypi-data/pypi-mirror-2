--------
Python wrapper for LSF APIs
--------

This library allows you to call the LSF APIs from Python. The wrapper is created
by using SWIG. Some commands are left out and some typemaps are defined. Still
not all API calls are supported yet. Please see the following list for
tested and support calls.

The following calls are tested and known to work reasonably well:

 * ls_getclustername
 * ls_initrex
 * ls_rexecv

 * lsb_init
 * lsb_lsb_submit
 * lsb_signaljob
 * lsb_peekjob

The project is structured as follows

Name       Description
