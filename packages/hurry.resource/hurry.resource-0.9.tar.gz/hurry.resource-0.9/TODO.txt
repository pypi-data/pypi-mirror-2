* Sometimes it would be nice to be able to *replace* a resource
  entirely with another. An example is ``z3c.listjs.listjs_css``,
  which only defines the CSS for the up and down button. You can
  currently define a new resource that depends on this which uses CSS
  rules to override things, and perhaps that's all right, but
  sometimes replacing the resource entirely would be better (and more
  efficient for page load times).

* For performance reasons it would be nice if we could somehow support
  auto-rollup for resources. See also Malthe's ``repoze.squeeze``.

* We have a usecase where a rolled up version exists with a minified
  mode available while for the individual resources no minified mode
  is available. It would be nice if we could support this.

* Some CSS only functions correctly if the following doctype is in the
  page::

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

  We could extend the insertion logic to put this in automatically if
  a CSS resource declares it needs this.
