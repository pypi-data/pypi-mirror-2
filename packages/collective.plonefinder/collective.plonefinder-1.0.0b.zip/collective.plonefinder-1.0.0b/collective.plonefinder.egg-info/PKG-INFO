Description: collective.plonefinder
        ======================
        
        
        Ajax popup to reference plone contents.
        
        This code is an extraction of plonearticle explorer for referencables contents
        
        The intent is to make it usable in different situations :
        
        - for referencable fields inside AT edit forms
        
        - to store selected contents in zope3 forms (portlet forms as example)
        
        - for collective.ckeditor or any possible wysiwyg editor for referencing images or contents inside a rich text field,
        it's also possible to upload files / images and create folders with this product (big part of code taken from collective.uploadify)
        
        - for links fields (as remoteUrl in ATLink) to reference internal links
        
        This work has been started at Ingeniweb in 2007 by Christophe Bosse & Jean-mat Grimaldi for PloneArticle product.
        
        
        How to use it as reference widget :
        ===================================
        
        A reference widget for zope3 forms is available inside this product.
        
        The widget can be used to store objects references in a sequence field.
        
        Example of use in a portlet form for a field named target_contents::
        
        from collective.plonefinder.widgets.referencewidget import FinderSelectWidget
        
        target_contents = schema.Tuple (title=u"Browse for contents",
        description =u"Choose contents to display "
        "with a plone finder window. ",
        required = False,
        default= ()
        )
        
        form_fields['target_contents'].custom_widget = FinderSelectWidget
        
        Example of use for images referencing::
        
        from collective.plonefinder.widgets.referencewidget import FinderSelectImageWidget
        
        target_images = schema.Tuple (title=u"Browse for images",
        description =u"Choose images to display "
        "with a plone finder window. "
        "You can select different image sizes. "
        "You can upload new images. ",
        required = False,
        default= ()
        )
        
        form_fields['target_images'].custom_widget = FinderSelectImageWidget
        
        
        How to use it in wysiwyg editor  :
        ==================================
        
        See the collective.ckeditor product as example.
        
        You can easily use it with another editor.
