	* Add a small trace module for logging.

Thu, 24 Jul 2008 04:23:42 +0900
	* Revamp the way we detect compilers; instead of relying on
	distutils/scons fragile convertions, we detect version directly from
	the given compiler command line (ala autoconf). Hopefully, this should
	be much more robust.

Wed, 09 Jul 2008 07:49:26 +0200
	* release 0.8.2

Tue, 08 Jul 2008 14:09:26 +0900

Sun, 22 Jun 2008 17:43:51 +0900
	* pyext tool now handle correctly msvc runtime problems; msvc build
	should work again (build tested on python2.6 with VS 2008)
	* scons updated to 0.98.5, to solve issues with sun compilers.

Thu, 12 Jun 2008 21:52:58 +0900
	* Release 0.8.0

Thu, 12 Jun 2008 20:45:21 +0900
	* Python Extension builders are now 'real' builders.
	* Build directories are handled differently; instead of messing with
	emitters, we handle it the usual scons way, with two scons scripts
	files.

Mon, 09 Jun 2008 00:21:52 +0900
	* Fix stupid bug with version being a non string
	* Make sure the right numscons is tested in sanity check for dist test

	* Release 0.7.3

Sun, 08 Jun 2008 18:24:28 +0900
	* Handle msvc 2008 by using a custom msvc tool (inspired by VS 2008
	support in python2.6 distutils).

Fri, 23 May 2008 18:26:14 +0900
	* Update to scons 0.98.4

Tue, 20 May 2008 21:38:07 +0900
	* Update sunc++ tool because scons one is buggy (sent patch upstream).

	* Update numscons to remove old and hackish code to circumvent old
	scons deficiencies which disappear in 0.98.0
	* Explicitly initialize DefaultEnvironment to avoid wasting time
	initializing a second time our tools
	* release 0.7.2

Fri, 16 May 2008 18:23:03 +0900

Sat, 03 May 2008 15:13:26 +0900
	* Add a Tool method to NumpyEnvironment, which knows about numscons
	toolpaths (internal and customized).
	* f2py is not loaded anymore by default, because it is quite costly
	(needs to import numpy.f2py).

Tue, 29 Apr 2008 20:54:50 +0900
	* 0.7.0 release
	* Update to scons 0.98.2

	* 0.6.3 release

Tue, 22 Apr 2008 17:42:43 +0900
	* CheckF77Clib now returns the same kind of output for unix-like
	linkers and MS linkers (something that can be fed to LINKFLAGS).
	* Consequently, less special-casing for ms tools for perflib checkers
	(in fortran runtime support).
	* Link commands are customize in the ms linker case too, now, to
	handle LINKFLAGSEND flag.

Tue, 22 Apr 2008 13:53:27 +0900
	* 0.6.2 release

Tue, 22 Apr 2008 13:26:58 +0900
	* Add a NumpyF2py builder, to avoid having to take care of distutils
	directories explictly.
	* F2py builder has been changed such as its emitter is always a list
	* distutils_dirs_emitter ensure its returned values are scons nodes,
	and not strings

Tue, 22 Apr 2008 11:06:27 +0900
	* Handle a silent option passed by the distutils scons command. For
	any level > 0, we don't display the full compilation commands anymore,
	but only terse message with the source file(s) through the scons
	COMSTR mechanism.

Sun, 20 Apr 2008 23:17:21 +0900
	* 0.6.1 release
	* numscons now successfully build numpy and scipy on linux + gcc,
	Win32 + mingw and Mac OS X + gcc

Sat, 12 Apr 2008 19:04:02 -0400
	* 0.6.0 release

Sat, 12 Apr 2008 18:03:26 -0400
	* f2py tool has been heavily updated. It now works with the --jobs
	option, and correctly emit the right target name automatically.
	* C++ has now its configuration file for c++ compilers.
	* fortran tools are modified such as F*COM use fortran specific
	include flag (-I) instead of the one from the C compiler, which cause
	problems for the VS/mingw32 combination.

Sat, 05 Apr 2008 09:22:10 -0700
	* Update our local copy of scons to 0.98.0. We should not need our own
	modified copy anymore, the upstream one should be enough !

Sat, 08 Mar 2008 20:08:20 +0900
	* Do not use -fast with sun compilers, because it cause random
	crashes, and can break IEEE conformance anyway.

Fri, 07 Mar 2008 22:26:31 +0900
	* GetNumpyEnvironment now returns NumpyEnvironment, a subclass of
	scons Environment. The long-term goal is to implement most code which
	makes cooperation with distutils into this class.

Thu, 06 Mar 2008 20:17:41 +0900
	* Do not use AppendUnique in save_set, because it is too fragile
	(imply reordering of some flags, e.g. libraries order, etc...).

Wed, 05 Mar 2008 23:23:58 +0900
	* 0.5.0 release
	* fix serious issue regarding build directories created outside the
	top directory of packages using numscons
	* fix an issue related to site.cfg customization for
	NumpyCheckLibAndHeader
	* various import fixes
	* NumpyGlob now internally uses scons Glob instead of glob.glob
	* Blas/Lapack checkers are refactored; all of them now use the same
	codepath

Sat, 01 Mar 2008 02:30:56 +0900
	* 0.4.2 release
	* source distribution fix: include .cfg files in MANIFEST.in

	* 0.4.1.1 release
	* Egg fix

Tue, 19 Feb 2008 03:32:25 +0900
	* 0.4.1 release
	* this relases main feature is support for MS compiler + g77 on
	windows. This means compiling scipy on windows with MS compiler is not
	that far anymore.

Thu, 14 Feb 2008 01:03:27 +0900
	* 0.4.0 release
	* this relases main feature is support for MS compiler on windows.

	* 0.3.4 release
	* this relases main feature is rewritten f77 link parser.

Sat, 26 Jan 2008 19:59:39 +0900

	* Handle correctly f77 runtime support when needed in CheckLAPACK and
	CheckBLAS.
	* lapack config uses cblas config in BuildConfigFactory (fixes
	#186127).

Sat, 26 Jan 2008 15:56:38 +0900
	* 0.3.2 released
	* fix auto-adding of perflib options in meta lib checkers, which
	caused wrong order of linkflags, and link errors in x86_64.

Thu, 24 Jan 2008 22:03:18 +0900
	* 0.3.1 release
	* setupegg.py to build eggs
	* data_dir arg works with sdist

Thu, 24 Jan 2008 00:17:52 +0900
	* 0.3.0 release.
	* Sunperf checker works again on indiana
	* rpath is not used with Apple linkers
	* Do not throw exception when no customization is available for
	compilers, but uses a default set of values instead.

Wed, 23 Jan 2008 20:03:24 +0900
	* 0.2.3.1 release. This is a trivial fix to build numpy with numscons

Wed, 23 Jan 2008 17:43:14 +0900
	* 0.2.3 release.

Thu, 17 Jan 2008 20:41:30 +0900
	* Major revamp of numscons.checkers

Tue, 08 Jan 2008 00:12:11 +0900
	* 0.2.2 release: numpy can be built on linux with gcc.

Sun, 06 Jan 2008 21:43:15 +0900
	* 0.2.1 release

Sun, 06 Jan 2008 21:25:45 +0900
	* Remove all dependencies on numpy.distutils.

Sun, 30 Dec 2007 16:15:30 +0900
	* the perflib configurations are now put into a configuration file.
	This should enable more drastic simplification to the internals of
	perflib, which is way too complicated right now.

Wed, 26 Dec 2007 21:34:07 +0900
	* the compiler configurations are now put into configuration files,
	which are read by the functions get_f77_config and get_cc_config.

Sun, 23 Dec 2007 01:21:50 +0900

	* Starting to work on a separate numscons package, which will implement
	most of the functionalities of numpy.distutils.scons.
	* The package does not do much yet: incorporate last released scons-local
	+ some patches I've done for CheckDeclaration and CheckTypeSize, not yet
	incorporated upstream.
