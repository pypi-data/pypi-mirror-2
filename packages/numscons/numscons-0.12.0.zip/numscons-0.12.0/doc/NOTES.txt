Some notes which may be useful when I will put real docs in shape.

Build directory
===============

Everything scons produces is put in a build directory (Using VariantDir from
scons). This include configuration code snippets, sconsign database and of
course built code. The build directory for each package is put in a
subdirectory of the directory "build/scons" (at the same level as the caller
scons script), so that it does not interfer with distutils (which puts its
thing into build itself).

Because numscons is driven by distutils, in particular everything is installed
by distutils, numscons has to put generated code in a place where distutils
expects it: the extensions built by numscons are copied into where distutils
look for them (in a subdirectory of build/lib.*), using the scons Install
builder (it is done by default by any Distutils* numscons builders).

The distutils build directory is not a reproduction of the source tree, but reflects the package name.

root\setup.py -> is set up with Configuration("foo")
     pkg1\setup.py -> is setup with Configuration ("bar")
     pkg2\subpkg1\setup.py -> is setup with Configuration ("foobar")
         \subpkg2\setup.py -> is setup with Configuration ("barfoo")

distutils will generate

root\build\lib.$arch\foo
                    \foo\bar\
                    \foo\bar\foobar
                    \foo\bar\barfoo
