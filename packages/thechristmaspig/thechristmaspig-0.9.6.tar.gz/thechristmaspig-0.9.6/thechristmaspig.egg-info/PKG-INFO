Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is a buildout recipe for setting up a base project and wsgi file.
        It started as a fork of `djangorecipe`_, mainly because I wanted to
        learn how it worked, which installs Django from SVN and does a lot of
        other things. This is stripped down now just to set up scripts in the
        Buildout environment and to generate the wsgi file. It doesn't install
        the Django package because I believe there are better recipes to do that.
        I also edited the project template that djangorecipe used as a base.
        
        
        Example Recipe
        ==============
        
        ::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = python django django-project
        eggs =
        extra-paths =
        ${buildout:directory}
        ${buildout:directory}/parts/django/
        
        [python]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        interpreter = python
        eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
        extra-paths = ${buildout:extra-paths}
        
        [django]
        recipe = zerokspot.recipe.git
        repository = git://github.com/django/django.git
        
        [django-project]
        recipe = thechristmaspig
        project = example
        script-name = django
        eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options.
        
        ``project``
        The name of the project directory to use or create.
        
        ``settings``
        The name of the settings file for the project. Defaults to ``settings``.
        
        ``extra-paths``
        Paths to extend the default Python path for the generated scripts.
        Defaults to the extra-paths parameter of the [buildout] configuration.
        
        ``script-name``
        The name of the scripts created in the bin folder. This script is the
        equivalent of the ``manage.py`` Django normally creates. By default it
        uses the name of the section (the part between the ``[ ]``).
        
        ``urlconf``
        You can set this to a specific url conf. It will use the
        ``project.urls`` where project is set by the ``project`` option.
        
        
        Sandbox Installation
        ====================
        
        Use the following commands to run a demo of this package.
        
        ::
        
        $ git clone git://github.com/prestontimmons/thechristmaspig.git
        $ cd thechristmaspig
        $ python bootstrap.py
        $ bin/buildout -v
        $ bin/django test
        
        
        Why the Name?
        =============
        
        Because all the good names for Django Buildout recipes were already taken.
