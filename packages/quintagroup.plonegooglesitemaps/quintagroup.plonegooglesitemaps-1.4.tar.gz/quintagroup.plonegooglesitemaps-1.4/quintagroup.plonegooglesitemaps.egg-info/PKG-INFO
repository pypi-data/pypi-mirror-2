Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Plone Google Sitemaps product allows Plone websites to get better visibility for Google search engine
        by providing it with complete listing of URLs to website content.
        
        Plone Google Sitemaps allows you to enable different kinds of Google Sitemaps on your Plone website.
        Such Sitemaps help Google identify site URLs and the data under each site section. With Google Sitemaps
        enabled, search engines could track your Plone site URLs faster and more efficiently, optimizing their
        search by placing all the information on one page.
        
        With Plone Google Sitemaps product you can enable following Sitemap types on your Plone website:
        
        * ``Content Sitemap`` - is a regular list of pages on your website. Creating and submitting such a Sitemap
        lets Google know about all the pages on your Plone web site, including URLs that may not be discoverable
        by Google's normal crawling process.
        * ``Mobile Sitemap`` - is a specific type of Sitemap, that indexes all site URLs that serve content for
        mobile devices.
        * ``News Sitemap`` - is different from regular Sitemaps, since it is specific to Google News only.
        It uses the Sitemap protocol, with additional News-specific tags, defined by Google. The package brings
        additional Google Sitempas tab to News Item content type for defining NewsSitemap-specific meta tags.
        
        Different Sitemap types index their own content and do not depend on other Sitemaps.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To enable Google Sitemaps on your site:

        You can add any of the Sitemap types: content, mobile or news.
