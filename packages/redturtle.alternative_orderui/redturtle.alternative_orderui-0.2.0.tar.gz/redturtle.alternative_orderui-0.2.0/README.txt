Introduction
============

An alternative *folder_contents* forms, that disable someway KSS ordering and show another fast way
to reorder items (less and less cool, but this is working most of the time).

Use this only when you (or your users) experience some problem with KSS ordering (not always this happens,
but happens...). If no-one report a problem with the basic Plone drag&drop sort mechanism, you don't need
this product.

TODO
====

* Tests on Plone 4
* Use jQuery Tools features if installed instead of the ugly Javascript confirm
* Find a KSS way to disable KSS
