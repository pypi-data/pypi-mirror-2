        This module is designed for two specific situations:
        
        - Replace an object
          
          - Temporarily return a canned value for a 
            method or allow a method to be called without affect.
        
        - Ensure an object is used correctly
        
          - Declare expectations about what methods should be 
            called and what arguments should be sent.
        
        Here is a quick preview of how you can test code that sends email without actually sending email::
            
            >>> import fudge
            >>> SMTP = fudge.Fake('SMTP')
            >>> SMTP = SMTP.expects('__init__')
            >>> SMTP = SMTP.expects('connect')
            >>> SMTP = SMTP.expects('sendmail').with_arg_count(3)
            >>> SMTP = SMTP.expects('close')
