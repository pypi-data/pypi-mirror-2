Hi, 

I was bored so I had to write something quick...

I call it PyMos, I should've called it PyMosaic, but that sounds too long.

It does something like this to input.jpg using collection/* as seen here - 
http://www.flickr.com/photos/ideamonk/4020798966/sizes/l/

How to make your own -
  grab some image, put it as input.jpg besides script
  grab some matching color images, push them into collection (any folder you like)
  , keep small images  
  how to - goto flickr.com search something, n.times do{ rightclick, save }
  run the script, let it work
  stare/zoom around output.png, show it to friends, feel k3wl

Then one night came YuviPanda and he hacked a little, hacked some more, and 
hacked till sunrise to add most of the + on the todos
