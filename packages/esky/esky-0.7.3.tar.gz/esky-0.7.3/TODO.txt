 * arrange for py2app apps to have the correct name
 * put all esky control files in an "esky" subdir, for cleanliness
 * trickery to detect process termination even from signals etc:
      * O_TEMPORARY and ReadDirectoryChangesW on win32
      * fcntl on a tempfile for unix?
 * py2exe: test operation of "optimize" and "unbuffered" flags
 * respect various distutils settings e.g. verbose, dry_run
 * tests for customisable bootstrap process
 * hooks for code signing etc in the build process
 * think about hooks for upgrade events

 py2app:
   * Frameworks/.../Version/Python changes even when using the same
     build environment.  Why?  What can we do about it?
