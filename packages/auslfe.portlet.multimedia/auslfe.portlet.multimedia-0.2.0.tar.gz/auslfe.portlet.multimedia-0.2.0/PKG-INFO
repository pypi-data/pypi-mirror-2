        =============
        
        Yet another multimedia/dynamic portlet for Plone that display images.
        
        Why you can like this instead of other? Because it works with Javascript disabled (with an eye
        onto the `Italian Accessibility Act`__) and is tested to work behind reverse-proxy (like
        `Varnish`__).

        How to use
        ----------
        
        The main information you must provide to the portlet is a Plone collection. The collection is
        used to retrieve all image-like contents from it. You can freely configure the collection to
        return also other content, but only ones marked as "image-able" are used (technically speaking:
        it also filter only contents that provides *IImageContent*, like "Image" and "News Item" content
        type already do).
        
        From the target collection is also used the "*Number of items*" field, to show in the portlet only
        a limited number of images.
        
        The "*Limit Search Results*" field is not directly used by this portlet, but change the collection
        behaviour. Enabling the client random feature with this check selected will only reorder a limited
        set of images.
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        What scare us about other Javascript-live multimedia portlet (besides accessibility) is the massive
        use of AJAX call to the server. This can lead to two problems:
        
        * too many request (and low performance)
        * random feature could work badly with cache in front of Plone
        
        For this reason this portlet will not query every *xyz* seconds the server, but simply get from
        the server all the images, the randomly reload it client side.
        
        The *auto-reload feature* can be disabled if you don't like it. You still have a random image
        set at page load time.
        
        Be aware: CSS styles
        --------------------
        
        Default Plone columns are narrow. Installing this will make your portlet min width a little bigger,
        enough for host 2 images for every row.

        * Tests on Plone 4: there is the new SunBurst Theme and jQuery 1.4.
