Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Allow Plone Collections to proxy the content to not switch the context.
        The proxied content is shown directly in the context of the collection.
        If the user klick on a collectionitem, only the url change but neither
        the navigation nor the breadcrums are modified.
        
        To activate the proxy just edit a collection, go to the settings and
        there you will find a checkbox.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        If you are using buildout, just add it to your eggs and your zcml in
        the instance part::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = inqbus.collection.proxy
            ...
            zcml = inqbus.collection.proxy
        
        Now, just run ''bin/buildout'' in your instance rootfolder to get the
        package and all of it dependencies. After that, you are able to install 
        it via the quickinstaller.
