Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        This package provides a GUI for managing custom workflows in Plone.
        
        Features
        --------
        
         * add/edit/delete new workflows
         * add content rule actions easily for a workflow transition
         * graph workflows
         * easily manipulate workflow permissions
        
        Graphing
        --------
        
        The package also supports graphing workflows. 
        
        The inspiration for this piece was pretty much taken from DCWorkflowGraph.
        
        In order to enable this feature, you'll need to install the Graphviz library.
