Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        This package provides a GUI for managing custom workflows in Plone.
        
        This is the successor of uwosh.northstar.
        
        Features
        --------
        
         * add/edit/delete new workflows
         * add content rule actions easily for a workflow transition
         * graph workflows
         * easily manipulate workflow permissions
        
        Graphing
        --------
        
        The package also supports graphing workflows. 
        
        The inspiration for this piece was pretty much taken from DCWorkflowGraph.
        
        In order to enable this feature, you'll need to install the Graphviz library.
        Information can be found at http://www.graphviz.org
