   > python setup.py build
  
  * This command will build the CUBRID-Python Driver. Make sure the current directory has the "write" permission, otherwise, the building process will fail.
    
   > python setup.py install
   
   * This will install CUBRID-Python Driver into your system. It is necessary to become root for this purpose.
   
 * Windows
  * Copy cubrid.pyd and cubriddb.py files to the Lib folder where your Python has been installed. By default it is C:\Program Files\Python\Lib\. This is the place where all other third-party libraries are located.
    
 * More inforamtion about CUBRID-Python Driver, its documentation as well as the tutorials can be foound at http://www.cubrid.org/python_programming
 
SAMPLES
