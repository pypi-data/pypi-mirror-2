        ==========================================
        Bazaar trailing whitespace killer plugin
        ==========================================
        
        The only thing this plugin does is checks all files you're committing and
        unconditionally kills trailing whitespaces from them. Additionally file ending
        is normalized - all empty lines at the end of file being committed are stripped
        and one is added (final newline is common and is expected usually).
        
        You can install it system-wide::
        
        pip install bzr-killtrailing
        
        But please don't try to uninstall it with pip, because ``bzrlib`` is not
        declared as a namespace by Bazaar, which means that pip will want to remove
        whole ``bzrlib`` (read: bazaar itself).
        
        Alternatively, you can install it in your home directory::
        
        mkdir -p ~/.bazaar/plugins/
        cd !$
        rm -rf killtrailing # clean up if you've had it before
        curl http://hg.piranha.org.ua/bzr-killtrailing/archive/tip.tar.gz | tar xf -
        mv bzr-killtrailing-* killtrailing
        
        Or, alternatively, if you have Mercurial installed, you could do that::
        
        mkdir -p ~/.bazaar/plugins/
        cd !$
        hg clone http://hg.piranha.org.ua/bzr-killtrailing/ killtraling
        
        You can check if a plugin is installed and ready to work by issuing this
        command::
        
        bzr plugins | grep killtrailing
        
        That's it! Enjoy. :)
