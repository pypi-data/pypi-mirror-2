Summary
=======

Parse Dreamweaver templates (.dwt files) and pages. Supports Dreamweaver 3 and
4 (very old).

This Package **only** provides the core tools to parse Dreamweaver templates,
create pages from them and then parse the pages. 

The related SiteTool package provides more advanced functionality such as the
ability to:

* reapply templates and library items to pages in a site
* scan for broken links and orphaned pages
* move a page and have the links in the rest of the site updated

The idea is that if you want to dynamically generate pages in say a web
application you will only need the DreamweaverTemplate package whereas if you
are looking to manage a site which follows the Dreamweaver model you would use
SiteTool.
