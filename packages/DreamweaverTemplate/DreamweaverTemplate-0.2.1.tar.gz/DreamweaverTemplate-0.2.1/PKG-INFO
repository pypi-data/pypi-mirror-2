        Summary
        =======
        
        Parse Dreamweaver templates (.dwt files) and pages. Supports Dreamweaver 3 and
        4 (very old).
        
        This Package **only** provides the core tools to parse Dreamweaver templates,
        create pages from them and then parse the pages. 
        
        The related SiteTool package provides more advanced functionality such as the
        ability to:
        
        * reapply templates and library items to pages in a site
        * scan for broken links and orphaned pages
        * move a page and have the links in the rest of the site updated
        
        The idea is that if you want to dynamically generate pages in say a web
        application you will only need the DreamweaverTemplate package whereas if you
        are looking to manage a site which follows the Dreamweaver model you would use
        SiteTool.
