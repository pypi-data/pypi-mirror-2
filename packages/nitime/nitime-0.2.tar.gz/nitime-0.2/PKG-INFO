Description: 
        ===================================================
        Nitime: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data
        ===================================================
        
        Nitime contains a core of numerical algorithms for time-series analysis both in
        the time and spectral domains, a set of container objects to represent
        time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high level interface to the
        numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy to express with compact
        and semantically clear code.
