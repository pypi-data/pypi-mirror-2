                    p4import.
                  - the perforce connections are being cached by path, to allow

                  - built a standard package for deploying on pypi.
v0.81b 2010-04-16 - settings['py_version_string'] will be replaced in the path
                    with python version ($major.$minor), so a host may serve 
                    modules for different python client versions
