 - being able to add a debug mode where you then can add a "debug=1" to the URL and it will render the individual
   resources instead
 - having not only names for clusters but also being able to define the filename. The first filename of a resource
   in a cluster might define the name for the whole cluster. Needs counting of these filenames then
 - adding packers for JS and CSS with again a debug flag
 - being able to simply point to fixed resources in form of URLs so that I can define all JS/CSS in one place
 - adding Google-AJAX-Loader-Resources e.g. for JQuery
