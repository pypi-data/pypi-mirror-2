===============================

django-formwizard is a reusable app to work with multi-page forms. Besides normal `Forms`, it  supports `FormSets` and `ModelForms`. File uploads don't work at the moment but this will be fixed in the near future.

To install it, simply run

.. code-block:: console

    # pip install django-formwizard
