Introduction
============

This package provides a DSpace interface on top of the Python OAI-PMH library,
pyoai. After providing the OAI-PMH server URL, items can be harvested either 
by collection handle or individually. Additional harvesting options such as 
dates are passed through directly to the pyoai client. 

Changes in version 2
====================

SWORD integration was added to support depositing items into the repository. 
This requires some changes in the URL handling on the Repository class.
