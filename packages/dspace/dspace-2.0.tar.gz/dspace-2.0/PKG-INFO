Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a DSpace interface on top of the Python OAI-PMH library,
        pyoai. After providing the OAI-PMH server URL, items can be harvested either 
        by collection handle or individually. Additional harvesting options such as 
        dates are passed through directly to the pyoai client. 
        
        Changes in version 2
        ====================
        
        SWORD integration was added to support depositing items into the repository. 
        This requires some changes in the URL handling on the Repository class.
