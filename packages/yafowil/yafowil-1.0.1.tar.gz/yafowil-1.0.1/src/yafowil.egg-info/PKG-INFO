Description: This is **Yet Another Form WIdget Library** (XHTML). There are plenty of 'em out
        in Python space.
        
        YAFOWIL offers html-form creation and modification at runtime. Its light-weight
        and provides an extensible, reusable set of form widgets, independent from any
        web-framework, but easy to use in your web-framework.
        
        It's all just about rendering widgets and extracting the data returned from the
        browser per widget. It does not fight with storage.
        
        Yafowil widgets are a bit different: Its all just configuration. No
        subclassing needed any more; no specific schema-framework is necessary.
        
        Yafowil provides a factory where you can fetch your widgets instances from.
        Or you register your own.
