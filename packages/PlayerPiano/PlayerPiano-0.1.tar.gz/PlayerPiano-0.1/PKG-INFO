        ##########################
        
        PlayerPiano amazes your friends by running Python doctests in a fake interactive shell.
        
        ``playerpiano`` plays back a recorded shell session in a terminal.
        
        ``recorderpiano`` can be used to record a shell session for later playback. 
        
        ****************************************
        Usage
        ****************************************
        Run ``playerpiano <options> <FILE>``, where FILE is a file containing doctests.
        
        Pressing any keys will type source lines, stop at the end of each source block.
        
        Press enter to show the results block.
        
        EOF (^D) will exit the program at the end.
        
        Break (^C) will interrrupt the program immediately.
        
        Options
        -------
        The ``--color`` option will syntax-highlight source lines. It is currently hard-coded for a black background terminal.
        
        The ``--no-terminal`` option will disable output on the main terminal. This is less than useful at present.
        
        The ``--fifo`` option takes the name of a fifo to duplicate output to. After starting playerpiano with this option, you must run ``cat name_of_fifo`` in another terminal before any output will be displayed. This is useful when presenting using a projector. Start a second xterm & run cat, then put it on the overhead (with the main terminal on your laptop). This allows you to see what you're doing.
        
        *****************************************
        Limitations
        *****************************************
        PlayerPiano only works on Unix-y operating systems, and requires a terminal that speaks VT100. If it works on Windows, please let the author know!
