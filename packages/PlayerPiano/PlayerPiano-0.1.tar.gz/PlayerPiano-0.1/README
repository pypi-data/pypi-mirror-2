##########################

PlayerPiano amazes your friends by running Python doctests in a fake interactive shell.

``playerpiano`` plays back a recorded shell session in a terminal.

``recorderpiano`` can be used to record a shell session for later playback. 

****************************************
Usage
****************************************
Run ``playerpiano <options> <FILE>``, where FILE is a file containing doctests.

Pressing any keys will type source lines, stop at the end of each source block.

Press enter to show the results block.

EOF (^D) will exit the program at the end.

Break (^C) will interrrupt the program immediately.

Options
-------
The ``--color`` option will syntax-highlight source lines. It is currently hard-coded for a black background terminal.

The ``--no-terminal`` option will disable output on the main terminal. This is less than useful at present.

The ``--fifo`` option takes the name of a fifo to duplicate output to. After starting playerpiano with this option, you must run ``cat name_of_fifo`` in another terminal before any output will be displayed. This is useful when presenting using a projector. Start a second xterm & run cat, then put it on the overhead (with the main terminal on your laptop). This allows you to see what you're doing.

*****************************************
Limitations
*****************************************
PlayerPiano only works on Unix-y operating systems, and requires a terminal that speaks VT100. If it works on Windows, please let the author know!
