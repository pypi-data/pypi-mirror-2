Description: aranha
        ------
        
        Aranha (pronounced aranya) is a simple web spider written in python using 
        gevent for asynchronicity.  Aranha means "spider" in portuguese.
        
        Aranha's goal is to be suitable for projects that need light url fetching
        or a simple spidering of a few classes of webpages.  If spidering is a major
        part of your project, you probably want to either write your own spider or
        use scrapy as a base, as it's much more sophisticated.
