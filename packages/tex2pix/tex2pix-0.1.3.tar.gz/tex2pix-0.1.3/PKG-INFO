Description: 
        A little library which renders LaTeX to various formats, using applications on
        your system like latex, pdflatex, bibtex, dvips, ps2eps, and convert. LaTeX is
        automatically run as many times as necessary to achieve a clean compile (with a
        user-provided max number of attempts), and Bibtex processing is supported.
        Compilation takes place in temporary directories which are automatically cleaned
        up, can be initiated on a file or text string and include extra input files, and
        rendering stages are cached to reduce rendering latency.
        
        See also the 'tex' module, for a more established TeX renderer with different
        design requirements.
        
        Usage example:
            r = Renderer("example.tex", runbibtex=True, extras=["example.bib"])
            #r.verbose = True
            #r.rmtmpdir = False
            print r.mkeps("example.eps")
            print r.mkpng("example.png")
            print r.mkpdf("example.pdf")
