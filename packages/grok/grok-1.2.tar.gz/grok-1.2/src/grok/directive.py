"""Grok directives.

This module defines Grok directives: the markers that users place
inside of their classes (and sometimes in their modules, too) to
direct how Grok registers their components.  For example, the first
directive defined below is `site`, which people programming Grok
applications normally use like this::

    class MyIndex(grok.Indexes):
        grok.site(MySite)
        ...

If the set of directives in this module looks rather small, remember
that most of the directives available in Grok actually come from the
`grokcore` modules on which Grok depends, where they have been placed so
that other projects can use them without having to pull in all of Grok.

    permissions they can simply be supplied as multiple arguments; there
    is no need to place them inside of a tuple or list::

    example, the declaration:

        class Mammoth(grok.Model):
            grok.traversable('thighbone')

    means that if the URL `/app/mymammoth` designates a Mammoth, then
    `/app/mymammoth/thighbone` will also be a valid URL (assuming that
    the Mammoth instance, at runtime, indeed has an attribute by that
    name)!  By default, the name that must be appended to the URL should
    simply be the same as the name of the attribute; but by providing a
    `name` keyword argument, the programmer can designate another name
    to appear in the URL instead of the raw attribute name.
