"""Grok publication factories and classes.

These factories, and the publication classes they return, make Grok
security different from the way that security normal operates during
Zope publication.  Instead of security proxies being wrapped around
every object generated during traversal, and then wrapped around the
final object before it is viewed, only a single security check is done
when Grok is in charge: a check to see whether the view selected at the
end of the traversal process is, in fact, permitted to display the
object.

    """Grok mixin that makes a publisher remove security proxies.

    This mixin overrides three methods from the `IPublication`
    interface (defined in `zope.publisher.interfaces`) to alter their
    security behavior.  The normal Zope machinery wraps a security
    proxy around the application object returned by
    `getApplication()`, and around each of the objects returned as
    `traverseName()` is then called for each URL component.  The
    versions here strip the security proxy off instead, returning the
    bare object (unless the object is a non-Grok view, in which case
    we leave the proxy installed for important security
    reasons).  Non-Grok views however, are handled like Grok views, if
    they provide `grok.interfaces.IGrokSecurityView`.

    Finally, when `callObject()` is asked to render
    the view, we quickly re-install a security proxy on the object, make
    sure that the current user is indeed allowed to invoke `__call__()`,
    then pass the bare object to the rendering machinery.

    The result is that, in place of the elaborate series of security
    checks made during the processing of a normal Zope request, Grok
    makes only a single security check: to see if the view can be
    permissibly rendered or not.
