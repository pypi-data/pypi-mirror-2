Release information
===================

This document aims to collect information about Grok's release procedure.

Binary eggs on Windows
----------------------

Grok aims to work on Windows as well. This is not a problem for the
most part, but takes special attention when updating the list of
dependencies.  The follow eggs need a compiler on Unixy platforms, and
a binary egg on Windows::

  zope.i18nmessageid 
  zope.interface
  zope.security
  zope.app.container
  ZODB3
  zope.hookable
  zope.proxy

Please make sure a Windows version of the egg is available when you
update a dependency!
