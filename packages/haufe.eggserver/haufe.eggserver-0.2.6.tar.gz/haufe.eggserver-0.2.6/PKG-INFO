Description: haufe.eggserver
        ---------------
        
        ``haufe.eggserver`` is a tiny webfront to a local egg/sourcecode archive
        distribution directory (eggs and other distribution files stored directly on
        the filesystem).
        
        It currently supports basic browsing through a local distribution
        directory on the filesystem and basic upload support for eggs and source
        code distributions (requires ``haufe.releaser``).  It supports out-of-the-box
        infinite repository directories.
        
        ``haufe.eggserver`` supports the standard setuptools upload protocol as well as
        out-of-the-box support for zc.buildout (``find-links`` option).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        - download the source code archive and unpack it
        
        - run ``buildout``
        
        - start the instance using ``bin/zopectl start``
        
        - add an eggserver application instance through the management interface
        
        - use the ``edit`` view for configuring the path to your local
        distribution directory and the visible title of your instance
        (Login with username ``admin`` and password ``123``)
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        - ``zc.buildout`` (use easy_install for installing zc.buildout)
        - ``Grok`` (will be installed automatically when using ``zc.buildout``)
        - ``gocept.cache`` (willl be installed automatically when using ``zc.buildout``)
        - optional ``haufe.releaser`` (use easy_install for install haufe.releaser)
        
        
        Uploading packages
        ==================
        
        You have to choices:
        
        - use ``haufe.releaser`` and its ``local_upload`` command
        
        - use the standard setuptools ``upload`` command:
        
        python2.4 setup.py sdist upload -r http://localhost:8080/eggs
        
        A 409 HTTP status code will be returned if the upload
        file exists.
        
        
        Things ``haufe.eggserver`` won't do
        ===================================
        
        Since ``haufe.eggserver`` is not designed as a full-fledged PyPI replacement,
        there are some things that the implementation will not do right do (and possibly
        will not do):
        
        - no dedicated security model (everyone is trused and allowed to upload packages). Keep in
        mind that ``haufe.eggserver`` is basically designed for company/project internal usage
