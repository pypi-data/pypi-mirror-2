haufe.eggserver
---------------

``haufe.eggserver`` is a tiny webfront to a local egg/sourcecode archive
distribution directory (eggs and other distribution files stored directly on
the filesystem).

It currently supports basic browsing through a local distribution 
directory on the filesystem and basic upload support for eggs and source
code distributions (requires ``haufe.releaser``).  It supports out-of-the-box
infinite repository directories.

``haufe.eggserver`` supports the standard setuptools upload protocol as well as
out-of-the-box support for zc.buildout (``find-links`` option).


Installation
============

- download the source code archive and unpack it

- run ``buildout``

- start the instance using ``bin/zopectl start``

- add an eggserver application instance through the management interface

- use the ``edit`` view for configuring the path to your local
  distribution directory and the visible title of your instance
  (Login with username ``admin`` and password ``123``)

Dependencies
============

- ``zc.buildout`` (use easy_install for installing zc.buildout)
- ``Grok`` (will be installed automatically when using ``zc.buildout``)
- ``gocept.cache`` (willl be installed automatically when using ``zc.buildout``)
- optional ``haufe.releaser`` (use easy_install for install haufe.releaser)


Uploading packages
==================

You have to choices:

- use ``haufe.releaser`` and its ``local_upload`` command

- use the standard setuptools ``upload`` command:

  python2.4 setup.py sdist upload -r http://localhost:8080/eggs

  A 409 HTTP status code will be returned if the upload
  file exists.


Things ``haufe.eggserver`` won't do
===================================

Since ``haufe.eggserver`` is not designed as a full-fledged PyPI replacement,
there are some things that the implementation will not do right do (and possibly
will not do):

- no dedicated security model (everyone is trused and allowed to upload packages). Keep in 
  mind that ``haufe.eggserver`` is basically designed for company/project internal usage
