=============
django-dumpdb
=============

``django-dumpdb`` saves and restored the contents of the database in a simple database-independent format.

It is designed to be fast and memory efficient, and can handle a database of
ANY size, in a reasonable time, with a fixed memory footprint.

Features
========

  * Stream-oriented file format.
  * Accesses the database directly, bypassing the ORM layer for better performance.
  * Uses server-side database cursors to preserve memory.
  * Can hanldle data with ``ForeignKey('self')`` and forward references.

Supported database backends
===========================

``django-dumpdb`` uses server-side cursors and deferred foreign key checks, which
is not supported by Django as of now. Therefore, it has to use some DB-specific
code. The following database backends are currently supported:

  * ``postgresql_psycopg2``
  * ``mysql``
  * ``sqlite``

Installation
============

Add ``django_dumpdb`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

Usage
=====

::

    manage.py dumpdb > db.dump
    manage.py restoredb < db.dump

Or even::

    ssh remotehost /var/www/myproject/manage.py dumpdb | manage.py restoredb

``django-dumpdb`` can also be used to migrate the data to another database (for
example, from MySQL to PostgreSQL).
