Description: =============
        django-dumpdb
        =============
        
        ``django-dumpdb`` saves and restored the contents of the database in a simple database-independent format.
        
        It is designed to be fast and memory efficient, and can handle a database of
        ANY size, in a reasonable time, with a fixed memory footprint.
        
        Features
        ========
        
          * Stream-oriented file format.
          * Accesses the database directly, bypassing the ORM layer for better performance.
          * Uses server-side database cursors to preserve memory.
          * Can hanldle data with ``ForeignKey('self')`` and forward references.
        
        Supported database backends
        ===========================
        
        ``django-dumpdb`` uses server-side cursors and deferred foreign key checks, which
        is not supported by Django as of now. Therefore, it has to use some DB-specific
        code. The following database backends are currently supported:
        
          * ``postgresql_psycopg2``
          * ``mysql``
          * ``sqlite``
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``django_dumpdb`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            manage.py dumpdb > db.dump
            manage.py restoredb < db.dump
        
        Or even::
        
            ssh remotehost /var/www/myproject/manage.py dumpdb | manage.py restoredb
        
        ``django-dumpdb`` can also be used to migrate the data to another database (for
        example, from MySQL to PostgreSQL).
