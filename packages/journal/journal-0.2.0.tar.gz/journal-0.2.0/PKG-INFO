Description: #Journal
        
        Journal is a Python command line tool to help with keeping a journal for work,
        personal, or any reason really!  Inspired by Peter Lyons'
        [article](http://peterlyons.com/leveling_up.html) on career development, my own
        experiences, and too much free time.
        
        Requires
        
        * Python (Tested on Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7)

        #Installation
        
            pip install journal
        
        The `journal` command should now be available on your command line.
        
        #Usage
        
        It's as simple as:
        
            $ journal "Task foo completed"
        
        and a `~/.journal/[CURRENT DATE].txt` file will be created using the current
        date, with a timestamp and your entry. Just continue to enter your tasks
        through the days and weeks and build a record of your work.
