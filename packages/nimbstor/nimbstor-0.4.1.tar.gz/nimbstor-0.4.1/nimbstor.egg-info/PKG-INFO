        Introduction
        ============
        
        You can use Nimbstor to create an persistent combined space on your filesystem
        directories, IMAP accounts or other backends. The data is mostly deduplicated
        and can be compressed, encrypted and stored redundant for failsafety.
        
        The intergrated utility "nimbtar" is an TAR clone, but stores the archives in
        Nimbstor. You can use it for incremental backups, or for storing and reading
        files on USB-Sticks, external harddrives, mailboxes, ...
        
        Until now, it has following features:
        
          - Create, show, search and extract archives as TAR files.
          - Each archive has an description and keywords.
          - Archives are deduplicated with rsync-like rolling hash algorithm (adler64).
          - Archives are splited and stored in blocks, each between 0 and 4 MiB large.
          - Blocks can be compressed (gzip, bzip2, LZMA) and encrypted (AES 256).
          - Support redundant store of blocks for failsafety.
          - Support filesystem directories backend, with one file per block.
          - Support IMAP mailboxes backend, with one message per block.
          - Copy archives without recompression and recryption between storages.
          - Parallel encryption and decryption.
        
        Other backends, like FTP/SFTP/HTTP/NNTP/..., will come soon.
        
        Install it with easy_install and type "nimbtar -h" for help.
        
        This version contains also performance speedup by extraction and some bug fixes.
