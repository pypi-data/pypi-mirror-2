        Introduction
        ============
        
        Nimbstor is designed to be a secure and reliable tool to store data
        deduplicated, compressed and encrypted in filesystems, IMAP accounts or other
        backends as searchable archive list.
        
        The intergrated utility "nimbtar" is an TAR clone, but stores the archives in
        Nimbstor. You can use it for incremental backups, or for storing and reading
        archives on USB-Sticks, external harddrives, mailboxes, ...
        
        Main features:
        
          - Create, show, search and extract archives like TAR files.
          - Each archive has an description, keywords and parent archive.
          - Archives are fully deduplicated with rsync-like rolling hash algorithm.
          - Archives are splited and stored on backend in blocks between 0 and 4 MiB large.
          - Blocks can be compressed (gzip, bzip2, LZMA) and encrypted (AES 256).
          - Support redundant store of blocks for failsafety.
          - Support filesystem directories backend, with one file per block.
          - Support IMAP mailboxes backend, with one message per block.
          - Copy archives without recompression and recryption between storages.
          - Parallel encryption and decryption.
        
        Other backends, like FTP/SFTP/HTTP/NNTP/..., will come soon.
        
        Install it with "easy_install nimbstor" and type "nimbtar -h" for help.
