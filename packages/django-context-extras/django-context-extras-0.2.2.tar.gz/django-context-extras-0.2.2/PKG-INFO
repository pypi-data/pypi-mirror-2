        Features
        ========
        
        This application currently provides two extra context processors:
        
        *current_site*
            Adds the current ``site`` instance to the template context.
        *project_settings*
            Adds the project's ``settings`` object to the template context, so you can
            access the project settings from within the templates.
        
        
        Documentation
