Description: 
        This is a fairly simple Django application that provides some extra context
        processors which are often needed by many other Django applications.
        
        This application currently provides two extra context processors:
        
        *current_site*
          Adds the current ``site`` instance to the template context.
        *project_settings*
          Adds the project's ``settings`` object to the template context, so you can
          access the project settings from within the templates.
        
        More information about the installation, configuration and usage of this
        application can be found in the *HELP* file inside the distribution package
        or in the project's
        `wiki <http://www.codetrax.org/projects/django-context-extras/wiki>`_.
        
        In case you run into any problems while using this application it is highly
        recommended you file a report at the project's
        `issue tracker <http://www.codetrax.org/projects/django-context-extras/issues>`_.
