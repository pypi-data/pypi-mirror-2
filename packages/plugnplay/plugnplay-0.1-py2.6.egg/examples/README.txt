Here is a simple example demonstrating plugnplay in action. This example implements the simple program of the main README file. It's a copy-file program.

Here is what is needed to run it.
 
 * First install plugnplay globally. You can do this running (at the root of the project)
   sudo python setup.py install
 * cd to the examples/filecopy folder: cd examples/filecopy
 * Then, run the main.py file: 
    python main.py <file-to-copy>
 * You will see this output:
    Copy done!
 * Now, run it with a different command line:
   PLUGIN_DIR=plugins python main.py <file-to-copy>
 * And see that the output is quite different. Thats why the plugins were called.


Now take a look at the code to see how easy is to add another plugin and as an exercise for you I will ask you to implement another HashChecker plugin, now for sha-256. Save your new plugin inside the plugins folder and re-run the program to see your brand new plugin in action!
