Decontractors: A Programming by Contract implementation using Decorators
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation idea came to me while discussion Design by Contract
implementations (pyContract, pyDBC, ...) at the May 2011 meeting
of PyUGAT, the Python User Group Austria.
