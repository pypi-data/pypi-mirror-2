libxml2dom (0.5) hardy; urgency=low

  * Fixed text node handling to work around the libxml2
    tendency to merge text nodes in its own functions.
  * Changed some XML-RPC node properties in order to retain
    underlying DOM properties such as data.
  * Added convenience methods to the XML-RPC implementation
    providing combined node creation and insertion.
    Introduced similar conveniences into the SOAP
    implementation. These methods are similar to those found
    in the XMPP implementation.
  * Enabled prettyprinting support, finally.
  * Added the hasChildNodes method, requested by Nick
    Galbreath.
  * Fixed the Debian packaging to use python-central.
  * Changed the XMPP API to only return document fragments
    from receive method calls; added support for failure
    elements; removed the internal timeout interval; added a
    disconnect method.

libxml2dom (0.4.7-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Fixed the ownerElement of attributes created by XPath
    queries, and in all other situations involving the
    implementation's get_node method.
  * Fixed SVG matrix operations which should have involved
    matrix post-multiplication.
  * Replaced the getElementById implementation with one
    based on libxml2's own support for finding attributes
    declared as identifiers.
  * Introduced support for validation, together with the
    libxml2dom.errors module. Relax-NG, XML Schema and
    Schematron are supported, depending on libxml2 support.
  * Improved error messages related to parsing.
  * Added DOMConfiguration support to documents.

libxml2dom (0.3.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

libxml2dom (0.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Imposed much stricter tests on strings used with the
    libxml2dom API. Strings given as arguments to methods
    and functions must now only contain ASCII characters;
    any other character data must be provided as Unicode

    expressions, and quite probably various other things.
  * Fixed parentNode on Document objects (which caused
    xml.dom.ext.PrettyPrint to crash).
  * Added some support for the doctype attribute and related
    information.

    docs/COPYING.txt for details.
