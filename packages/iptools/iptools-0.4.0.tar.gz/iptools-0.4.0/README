Utitlities for dealing with ip addresses.

  A few useful functions and objects for manipulating ip addresses in python. 
  This was all inspired by a desire to be able to use CIDR address notation to 
  designate INTERNAL_IPS in a Django project's settings file.

  The IpRangeList object can be used in a django settings file to allow CIDR 
  notation and/or (start, end) ranges to be used in the INTERNAL_IPS list.

  Example:

    INTERNAL_IPS = IpRangeList(
        '127.0.0.1',
        '192.168/16',
        ('10.0.0.1', '10.0.0.19'),
    )
