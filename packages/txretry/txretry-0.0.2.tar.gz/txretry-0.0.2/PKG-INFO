Description: txretry provides a Twisted class RetryingCall that will attempt to call a
        function until it succeeds. A back-off iterator (an interator yielding
        intervals) can be provided to set the interval between retried calls.
        When/if the back-off iterator raises StopIteration the attempt to call the
        function is aborted. An instance of the RetryingCall class provides a
        start() method that returns a deferred that will fire with the function
        result or errback with the first failure encountered.
        
        Usage of the class is described in the following blog post:
