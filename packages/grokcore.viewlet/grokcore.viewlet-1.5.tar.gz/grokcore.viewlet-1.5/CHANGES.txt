Changes
=======

1.5 (2010-10-18)
----------------

* Make package comply to zope.org repository policy.

* Update functional tests to use Browser implementation of zope.app.wsgi
  instead of zope.app.testing.

* Reduce dependencies (zope.app.pagetemplate no longer necessary).

1.4.1 (2010-02-28)
------------------

* Dropped the dependency on ``zope.app.zcmlfiles``.

* Cleaned the code to remove unused imports and ensure the pep8 syntax.

* Updated tests to have a return value consistency. The
  grokcore.viewlet viewlet manager implementation requires viewlets to
  return unicode strings. Now, viewlets return unicode strings in the
  test packages.

1.4 (2010-02-19)
----------------

* Define test requires.

1.3 (2009-09-17)
----------------

* Reverted the use of grokcore.view.CodeView. We now require
  ``grokcore.view`` 1.12.1 or newer. As of ``grokcore.view`` 1.12, the
  CodeView/View separation has been undone.

1.2 (2009-09-16)
----------------

* Remove the reference to the grok.View permission that is no longer in
  grokcore.security 1.2

* Use the grok.zope.org/releaseinfo information instead of our own
  copy of ``versions.cfg``, for easier maintenance.


1.1 (2009-07-20)
----------------

* Adapted tests to new grokcore.view release: switched from View to CodeView.

* Add grok.View permissions to functional tests (requires grokcore.security
  1.1)

1.0 (2008-11-15)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.viewlet`` in November 2008 by factoring
  ``zope.viewlet``-based components, grokkers and directives out of
  Grok.
