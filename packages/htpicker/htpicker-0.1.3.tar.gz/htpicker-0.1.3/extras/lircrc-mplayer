# Sample mplayer lircrc configuration.

# This config assumes an MCE remote.  You may need to change the button names
# if you have a different remote.  Use the irw command to find the names for
# your remote's buttons.
#
# To use this config, paste it to the end of your ~/.lircrc (create the file if
# it doesn't exist).
