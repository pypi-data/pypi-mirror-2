# Sample htpicker lircrc configuration.

# This config assumes an MCE remote.  You may need to change the button names
# if you have a different remote.  Use the irw command to find the names for
# your remote's buttons.
#
# To use this config, paste it to the end of your ~/.lircrc (create the file if
# it doesn't exist).

# To enable the exiting (killing) of lirc-ignorant programs that get launched
# by htpicker with your remote's back button, you must have irexec running.
# Launch it with 'irexec --daemon' in your startup scripts.  You will also need
# to add your programs' name(s) to the 'pkill' command if you launch any
# lirc-ignorant apps other than zsnes and fceu.
