Code
====

The 'htpicker' file was originally derived from demos/browser.py from
pywebkitgtk SVN r161 on Google Code, which was copyrighted by Jan Michael
Alonzo and licensed under the GPL.  However, at this point, no original code
remains other than a couple trivial lines that would inevitably be written
exactly the same way by any programmer.
