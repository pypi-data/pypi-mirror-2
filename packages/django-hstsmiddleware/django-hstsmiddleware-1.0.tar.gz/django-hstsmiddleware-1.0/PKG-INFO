Description: django-hstsmiddleware
        =====================
        
        Forces the use of `HTTPS` using `HTTP Strict Transport Security`
        (HSTS).
        
        
        Installation and Usage
        ----------------------
        
        Install the package, add ``django_hstsmiddleware`` to
        ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``, and add
        ``django_hstsmiddleware.middleware.HSTSMiddleware`` to the top of
        ``settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``.
        
        The following Django settings control its default behaviour:
        
        ``settings.HSTS_REDIRECT_TO``:
            Specifies the URI to redirect a User Agent to, if it tries
            to use a non-secure connection. Responds with HTTP Moved
            Permanently.
        
            Defaults to ``None``, so no redirect occurs. Instead, responds
            with HTTP Bad Request.
        
        ``settings.HSTS_MAX_AGE``:
            The maximum number of seconds that a User Agent will remember
            that this server must be contacted over HTTPS.
        
            Defaults to ``31536000``, or approximately one year.
        
        ``settings.HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS``:
            If true, tells a User Agent that all subdomains must also be
            contacted over HTTPS, in addition to the current domain.
        
            Defaults to ``False``
