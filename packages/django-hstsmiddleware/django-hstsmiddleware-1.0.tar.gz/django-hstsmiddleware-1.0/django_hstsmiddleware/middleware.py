    Forces the use of `HTTPS`_ using `HTTP Strict Transport Security`_ (HSTS).

    Install it at the top of :data:`settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.

    The following Django settings control its default behaviour:

    :data:`settings.HSTS_REDIRECT_TO`:
        Specifies the |URI| to redirect a User Agent to, if it tries
        to use a non-secure connection. Responds with |HTTP Moved
        Permanently|.

        Defaults to ``None``, so no redirect occurs. Instead, responds
        with |HTTP Bad Request|.

    :data:`settings.HSTS_MAX_AGE`:
        The maximum number of seconds that a User Agent will remember
        that this server must be contacted over HTTPS.

        Defaults to ``31536000``, or approximately one year.

    :data:`settings.HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`:
        If true, tells a User Agent that all subdomains must also be
        contacted over HTTPS, in addition to the current domain.

        Defaults to ``False``
