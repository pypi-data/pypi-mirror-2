Pants
*****

Pants is a lightweight framework for writing asynchronous network applications
in Python. It is a simple, efficient and versatile networking solution which
makes no assumptions about your use-case, provides no superfluous features and
is very good-looking.

Install
=======

roll::

`git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ repository::
