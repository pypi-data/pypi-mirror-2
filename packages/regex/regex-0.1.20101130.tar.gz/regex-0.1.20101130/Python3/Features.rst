Note
----

For testing and comparison with the current 're' module the new implementation is in the form of a module called 'regex'.

Please note that certain aspects of this module have changed from those of previous versions to make it conform better to the 're' module.


Building for 64-bits
--------------------

If the source files are built for a 64-bit target then the string positions will also be 64-bit. (The 're' module appears to limit string positions to 32 bits, even on a 64-bit build.)


Flags
-----

There are 2 kinds of flag: scoped and global. Scoped flags can apply to only part of a pattern and can be turned on or off; global flags apply to the entire pattern and can only be turned on.

The scoped flags are: ``IGNORECASE``, ``MULTILINE``, ``DOTALL``, ``VERBOSE``, ``WORD``.

The global flags are: ``ASCII``, ``LOCALE``, ``NEW``, ``REVERSE``, ``UNICODE``.

The ``NEW`` flag turns on the new behaviour of this module, which can differ from that of the 're' module, such as splitting on zero-width matches, inline flags affecting only what follows, and being able to turn inline flags off.

Note: The ``ZEROWIDTH`` flag which was in previous versions of this module has been removed. The ``NEW`` flag should be used instead.


Notes on named capture groups
-----------------------------

All capture groups have a group number, starting from 1.

Groups with the same group name will have the same group number, and groups with a different group name will have a different group number.

The same group name can be used on different branches of an alternation because they are mutually exclusive, eg. ``(?P<foo>first)|(?P<foo>second)``. They will, of course, have the same group number.

Group numbers will be reused, where possible, across different branches of a branch reset, eg. ``(?|(first)|(second))`` has only group 1. If capture groups have different group names then they will, of course, have different group numbers, eg. ``(?|(?P<foo>first)|(?P<bar>second))`` has group 1 ("foo") and group 2 ("bar").


Unicode
-------

This module supports Unicode 6.0.0.


Additional features
-------------------

* regex.escape (issue #2650)

    regex.escape has an additional keyword parameter ``special_only``. When True, only 'special' regex characters, such as '?', are escaped.

    Examples:

        >>> regex.escape("foo!?")
        'foo\\!\\?'
        >>> regex.escape("foo!?", special_only=True)
        'foo!\\?'

* Repeated captures (issue #7132)

    A match object has additional methods which return information on all the successful matches of a repeated capture group. These methods are:

    ``matchobject.captures([group1, ...])``

        Returns a tuple of the strings matched in a group or groups. Compare with ``matchobject.group([group1, ...])``.

    ``matchobject.starts([group])``

        Returns a tuple of the start positions. Compare with ``matchobject.start([group])``.

    ``matchobject.ends([group])``

        Returns a tuple of the end positions. Compare with ``matchobject.end([group])``.

    ``matchobject.spans([group])``

        Returns a tuple of the spans. Compare with ``matchobject.span([group])``.

    Examples:

        >>> m = regex.search(r"(\w{3})+", "123456789")
        >>> m.group(1)
        '789'
        >>> m.captures(1)
        ('123', '456', '789')
        >>> m.start(1)
        6
        >>> m.starts(1)
        (0, 3, 6)
        >>> m.end(1)
        9
        >>> m.ends(1)
        (3, 6, 9)
        >>> m.span(1)
        (6, 9)
        >>> m.spans(1)
        ((0, 3), (3, 6), (6, 9))

* Atomic grouping (issue #433030)

    ``(?>...)``

    If the following pattern subsequently fails, then the subpattern as a whole will fail.

* Possessive quantifiers.

    ``(?:...)?+`` ; ``(?:...)*+`` ; ``(?:...)++`` ; ``(?:...){min,max}+``

    The subpattern is matched up to 'max' times. If the following pattern subsequently fails, then all of the repeated subpatterns will fail as a whole. For example, ``(?:...)++`` is equivalent to ``(?>(?:...)+)``.

* Scoped flags (issue #433028)

    ``(?flags-flags:...)``

    The flags will apply only to the subpattern. Flags can be turned on or off.

* Inline flags (issue #433024, issue #433027)

    ``(?flags-flags)``

    If the ``NEW`` flag is turned on then the flags will apply to the end of the group or pattern and can be turned on or off. If the ``NEW`` flag isn't turned on then the flags will be global and can't be turned off.

* Repeated repeats (issue #2537)

    A regex like ``((x|y+)*)*`` will be accepted and will work correctly, but should complete more quickly.

* Definition of 'word' character (issue #1693050)

    The definition of a 'word' character has been expanded for Unicode. This applies to ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\b`` and ``\B``.

* Groups in lookahead and lookbehind (issue #814253)

    Groups and group references are permitted in both lookahead and lookbehind.

* Variable-length lookbehind

    A lookbehind can match a variable-length string.

* Correct handling of charset with ignore case flag (issue #3511)

    Ranges within charsets are handled correctly when the ignore-case flag is turned on.

* Unmatched group in replacement (issue #1519638)

    An unmatched group is treated as an empty string in a replacement template.

* 'Pathological' patterns (issue #1566086, issue #1662581, issue #1448325, issue #1721518, issue #1297193)

    'Pathological' patterns should complete more quickly.

* Flags argument for regex.split, regex.sub and regex.subn (issue #3482)

    ``regex.split``, ``regex.sub`` and ``regex.subn`` support a 'flags' argument.

* Pos and endpos arguments for regex.sub and regex.subn

    ``regex.sub`` and ``regex.subn`` support 'pos' and 'endpos' arguments.

* 'Overlapped' argument for regex.findall and regex.finditer

    ``regex.findall`` and ``regex.finditer`` support an 'overlapped' flag which permits overlapped matches.

* Unicode escapes (issue #3665)

    The Unicode escapes ``\uxxxx`` and ``\Uxxxxxxxx`` are supported.

* Large patterns (issue #1160)

    Patterns can be much larger.

* Zero-width match with regex.finditer (issue #1647489)

    ``regex.finditer`` behaves correctly when it splits at a zero-width match.

* Zero-width split with regex.split (issue #3262)

    ``regex.split`` can split at a zero-width match if the ``NEW`` flag is turned on. When the flag is turned off the current behaviour is unchanged because the BDFL thinks that some existing software might depend on it.

* Splititer

    ``regex.splititer`` has been added. It's a generator equivalent of ``regex.split``.

* Subscripting for groups

    A match object accepts access to the captured groups via subscripting and slicing:

    >>> m = regex.search(r"(?P<before>.*?)(?P<num>\d+)(?P<after>.*)", "pqr123stu")
    >>> print m["before"]
    pqr
    >>> print m["num"]
    123
    >>> print m["after"]
    stu
    >>> print len(m)
    4
    >>> print m[:]
    ('pqr123stu', 'pqr', '123', 'stu')

* Named groups

    Groups can be named with ``(?<name>...)`` as well as the current ``(?P<name>...)``.

* Group references

    Groups can be referenced within a pattern with ``\g<name>``. This also allows there to be more than 99 groups.

* Named characters

    ``\N{name}``

    Named characters are supported.

* Unicode codepoint properties, blocks and scripts

    ``\p{name}`` ; ``\P{name}``

    Unicode properties, blocks and scripts are supported. ``\p{name}`` matches a character which has property 'name' and ``\P{name}`` matches a character which doesn't have property 'name'.

    In order to avoid ambiguity, block names should start with ``In`` and script names should start with ``Is``. If a name lacks such a prefix and it could be a block or a script, script will take priority, for example:

    1. ``InBasicLatin`` or ``BasicLatin``, the 'BasicLatin' **block**.

    2. ``IsLatin`` or ``Latin``, the 'Latin' **script**.

    3. ``InCyrillic``, the 'Cyrillic' **block**.

    4. ``IsCyrillic`` or ``Cyrillic``, the 'Cyrillic' **script**.

* Posix character classes

    ``[[:alpha:]]``

    Posix character classes are supported.

* Search anchor

    ``\G``

    A search anchor has been added. It matches at the position where each search started/continued and can be used for contiguous matches or in negative variable-length lookbehinds to limit how far back the lookbehind goes:

    >>> regex.findall(r"\w{2}", "abcd ef")
    ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
    >>> regex.findall(r"\G\w{2}", "abcd ef")
    ['ab', 'cd']

    1. The search starts at position 0 and matches 2 letters 'ab'.

    2. The search continues at position 2 and matches 2 letters 'cd'.

    3. The search continues at position 4 and fails to match any letters.

    4. The anchor stops the search start position from being advanced, so there are no more results.

* Reverse searching

    Searches can now work backwards:

    >>> regex.findall(r".", "abc")
    ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> regex.findall(r"(?r).", "abc")
    ['c', 'b', 'a']

    Note: the result of a reverse search is not necessarily the reverse of a forward search:

    >>> regex.findall(r"..", "abcde")
    ['ab', 'cd']
    >>> regex.findall(r"(?r)..", "abcde")
    ['de', 'bc']

* Multithreading

    The regex module releases the GIL when matching on instances of the built-in (immutable) string classes, enabling other Python threads to run concurrently.

* Matching a single grapheme

    ``\X``

    The grapheme matcher is supported. It's equivalent to ``\P{M}\p{M}*``.

* Branch reset

    (?|...|...)

    Capture group numbers will be reused across the alternatives.

* Default Unicode word boundary

    The ``WORD`` flag changes the definition of a 'word boundary' to that of a default Unicode word boundary. This applies to ``\b`` and ``\B``.

    Please note: I'm unsure whether I've understood the specification correctly, so if you're using this feature I'd be interested in any feedback.
