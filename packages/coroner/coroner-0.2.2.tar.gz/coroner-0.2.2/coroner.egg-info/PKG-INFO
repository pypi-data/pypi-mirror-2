Description: ``coroner``
        ===========
        
        Wraps python invocations in code to do post-mortem debugging
        and sundry usefulnesses.
        
        ``coroner`` was adapted from a stackoverflow.com `response`_
        by `synthesizerpatel`_.

        Usage
        -----
        
        ``coroner`` is meant to be used as a command line module,
        invoked with code like::
        
            python -m coroner some_sketchy_module.py
        
        When the sketchy script invariably throws an exception,
        ``coroner`` will initiate a ``pdb.pm`` post-mortem debugging session.
        
        You can also use it in the other ways that ``python`` can be used
        on the command line, e.g. with ``-c`` or ``-``.
        
        
        Bugs
        ----
        
        That's all, folks.  I might add more sometime soon.
        
        Oh yeah, it doesn't do recursive module invocation yet.
        
        Also I haven't really tested it, just tried it with ``-c`` a couple of times.
