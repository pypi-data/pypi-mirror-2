        ## What is this?
        
        A django application for posting news. This is a fairly decent *news or
        blogging* application, and easily provides features like comments, markup,
        and RSS and ATOM feeds at no cost. However it makes no assumptions regarding
        your design, and therefore doesn't include any WYSIWYG/WYSIWYM editors or
        anything like that. You can easily add your own by simply applying it to
        <textarea> elements with a 'text-edit' class. This application also ties into
        the django user authentication system to allow multiple users to post, edit,
        and delete news articles on the web site.
