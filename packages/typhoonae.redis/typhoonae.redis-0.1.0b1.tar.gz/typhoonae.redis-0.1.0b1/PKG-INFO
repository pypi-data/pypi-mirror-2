Description: =========================
        TyphoonAE Redis Datastore
        =========================
        
        This package contains an API proxy stub to connect TyphoonAE or the Google App
        Engine SDK to a Redis database.
        
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Redis is an advanced key-value store. In contrast to approaches like memcache,
        its dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, lists, sets, and
        ordered sets. All this data types can be manipulated with atomic operations to
        push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform server side union,
        intersection, difference between sets, and so forth. And Redis supports
        different kinds of sorting abilities.
        
        Since Redis provides master-slave replication with very fast non-blocking first
        synchronization and auto reconnection on net split, it is very interesting to
        be used as Datastore backend for TyphoonAE. This package contains the API proxy
        stub to seamlessly connect TyphoonAE or the Google App Engine SDK to a Redis
        database server.

        Building and Testing
        ====================
        
        Get a local copy of the TyphoonAE Redis repository with this command:
        
        $ hg clone https://redis.typhoonae.googlecode.com/hg/ typhoonae-redis
        
        Change into the typhoonae-redis directory and run the buildout:
        
        $ python bootstrap.py
        $ bin/buildout
        
        To run all unit tests start the Redis server and enter the following command:
        
        $ bin/nosetests
        
        
        Using the TyphoonAE Redis Datstore with the Google App Engine SDK
        =================================================================
        
        This buildout already downloads and patches the Google App Engine SDK for you.
        In order to use the Redis Datastore just start the development appserver with
        an additional option:
        
        $ bin/dev_appserver --use_redis parts/google_appengine/demos/guestbook/
        
        Important: The Redis server must be listening on port 6379.
        
        The Datastore Redis stub also supports the SDK's bulkloader. Thus it should be
        possible to restore downloaded data into your local running application.
        
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        Since the TyphoonAE project uses Mercurial as SCM, you can easily create a
        clone of it on http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/source/clones?repo=redis.
