Yamaha SY Synth File Format List
================================

There are quite a few different types of files for the SY series. The SY85 and 
SY99 use the same "SY-WAVE" (extension `.W??`) sample file format.


SY77/99
-------

Here is a partial listing of SY77 and SY99 file types as of March 1990. All 
files listed can be numbered from 01 to 99 (e.g. `*.T01` - `*.T99`). If you
have several files on the same disk, they must have different numbers or the 
synth will only recognize the first file.

    .T?? - SY99/77 all data
    .J?? - SY99/77 synthesizer all data
    .K?? - SY99/77 sequencer all data
    .W?? - SY99 sample
    .C?? - SY99 card data
    .B?? - SY99 MDR data
    .M?? - SY99/77 KSEQ sequencer data
    .L?? - SY99/77 ESEQ sequencer data
    .X?? - SY99 Standard Midi File (format 0)

Most of the file formats for other SY series synths/modules are different than 
these as they are not compatible with the SY99/77 with the exception of the 
TG77 (rack version of the SY77) and the SY99 sample file format, which is also 
compatible with the SY85.


SY85
----

    .G?? - SY85 all data
    .W?? - SY99/85 sample

The TG500 does not have a disk drive, only two RAM card slots, which can only 
store patch data, so for storage purposes it receives and transmits only MIDI 
sysex bulk dumps.
