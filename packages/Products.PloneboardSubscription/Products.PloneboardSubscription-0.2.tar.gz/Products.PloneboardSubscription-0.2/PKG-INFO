Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Products.PloneboardSubscription enables users to subscribe/unsubscribe to email
        notification to a Ploneboard forum or a particular conversation. A "Subscribe/Unsubscribe"
        link is provided on the forum or conversation and if the user chooses to subscribe, any further
        comments made to the forum or conversation triggers an email.
        
        The product creates a tool "portal_pbnotification" at the Plone site which contains some
        parameters that can be set.
