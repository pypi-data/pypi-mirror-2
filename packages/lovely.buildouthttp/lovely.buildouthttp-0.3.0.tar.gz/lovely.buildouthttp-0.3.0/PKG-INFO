Description: =========================
        HTTP plugins for buildout
        =========================
        
        HTTP Basic-Authenication
        ========================
        
        Whith this extension it is possible to define password protected
        package directories without specifying the password and user in the
        url.
        
        Example: protected location http://www.example.com/dist
        
        
        File buildout.cfg:
        [buildout]
        find-links=http://www.example.com/dist
        extensions=lovely.buildouthttp
        
        Create the password file, this file contains all authentication
        information. Each row consists of realm, uri, username, password.
        
        file ~/.buildout/.httpauth:
        Example com realm, http://www.example.com, username, secret
        
        Note that basic auth also works with any recipe using
        zc.buildout.download (e.g. hexagonit.recipe.download) because this
        extension also overwrites the url opener of zc.buildout.
        
        Github Private Downloads
        ========================
        
        Private downloads on http://github.com/ are protected by a user token
        (see: http://github.com/blog/170-token-authentication). This extension
        allows to use such urls too. It uses the global git configuration for
        ``github.user`` and ``github.token``. For setting up this config see
        http://github.com/blog/180-local-github-config.
