Description: TiddlyWeb plugin for server-side import into a selected bag
        of tiddlers from a TiddlyWiki.
        
        A form hosted at {server_prefix}/import provides and interface for
        uploading a tiddlywiki by URL or file (from local disk). The tiddlers
        in that wiki will be loaded into a temporary bag. An interface is
        then provided to select from those tiddlers a subset to be installed
        into a target bag.
