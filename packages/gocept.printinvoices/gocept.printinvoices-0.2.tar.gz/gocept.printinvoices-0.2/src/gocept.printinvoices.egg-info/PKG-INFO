Description: gocept.printinvoices
        ====================
        
        Analyzes Postscript files containing batches of invoices output by Collmex and
        inserts printer control commands to make the printer use paper from one tray
        for first pages and paper from another tray for subsequent pages.
        
        Works with Collmex output as of March, 2011 and with a Kyocera FS 1128MFP
        printer.
        
        The package comes with two console_script entry points, ``process-ps`` and
        ``process-pdf``.
        
        The first one, ``process-ps``,
        implements a stream filter reading Postscript from stdin and writing
        Postscript to stdout. The entry point needs to be called with two arguments:
        ``tray1`` specifying the number of the tray holding first-page paper, and
        ``tray2`` specifying the tray number for subsequent pages. There isn't
        currently a configuration file or command-line arguments for configuring the
        trays.
        
        The second script, ``process-pdf``, takes four command-line arguments: the
        numbers of the papers trays used for first pages and subsequent pages, resp.,
        the path to a PDF file as output by Collmex and the name of a printer queue
        for the ``lpr`` command to print to.
