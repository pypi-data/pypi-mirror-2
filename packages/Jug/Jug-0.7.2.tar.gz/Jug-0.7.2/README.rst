Jug: A Task-Based Parallelization Framework
-------------------------------------------

Jug allows you to write code that is broken up into
tasks and run different tasks on different processors.

It uses the filesystem to communicate between processes and
works correctly over NFS, so you can coordinate processes on
different machines.

Jug is a pure Python implementation and should work on any platform.

Short Example
.............

Here is a one minute example. Save the following to a file called ``primes.py``::

    from jug import TaskGenerator
    from time import sleep

    @TaskGenerator
    def is_prime(n):
        sleep(1.)
        for j in xrange(2,n-1):
            if (n % j) == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes100 = map(is_prime, xrange(2,101))

Of course, this is only for didactical purposes, normally you would use a
better method. Similarly, the ``sleep`` function is so that it does not run too
fast.

Now type ``jug status primes.py`` to get::

    Task name                  Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    primes.is_prime                  0          99           0           0
    ......................................................................
    Total:                           0          99           0           0


This tells you that you have 99 tasks called ``primes.is_prime`` ready to run.
So run ``jug execute primes.py &``. You can even run multiple instances in the
background (if you have multiple cores, for example). After starting 4
instances and waiting a few seconds, you can check the status again (with ``jug
status primes.py``)::

    Task name                  Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    primes.is_prime                  0          63          32           4
    ......................................................................
    Total:                           0          63          32           4


Now you have 32 tasks finished, 4 running, and 63 still ready. Eventually, they
will all finish and you can inspect the results with ``jug shell primes.py``.
This will give you an ``ipython`` shell. The `primes100` variable is available,
but it is an ugly list of `jug.Task` objects. To get the actual value, you call
the `value` function::

    In [1]: primes100 = value(primes100)

    In [2]: primes100[:10]
    Out[2]: [True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True]
