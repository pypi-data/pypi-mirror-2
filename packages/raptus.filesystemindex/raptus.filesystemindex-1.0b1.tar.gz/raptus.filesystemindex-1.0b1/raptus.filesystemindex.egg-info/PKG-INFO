Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        raptus.filesystemindex provides a content type able to list a specific
        folder on the server and allows browsing through it. Additionally one
        may map the folder to a default mount on the users machine (for intranets)
        which then allows the viewer to open the files contained in the folder and
        its subfolders.
        
        Firefox compatibility
        ---------------------
        
        Firefox by default does not allow to open local links, an add on called
        `LocalLink <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/281/>`_ is 
        required to enable opening local links over the context menu.
