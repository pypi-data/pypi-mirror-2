Introduction
============

raptus.filesystemindex provides a content type able to list a specific
folder on the server and allows browsing through it. Additionally one
may map the folder to a default mount on the users machine (for intranets)
which then allows the viewer to open the files contained in the folder and
its subfolders.

Firefox compatibility
---------------------

Firefox by default does not allow to open local links, an add on called
`LocalLink <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/281/>`_ is 
required to enable opening local links over the context menu.
