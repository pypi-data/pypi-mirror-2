            In order to use the Google APIs, you must import them using the Google API
            loader in conjunction with the API key. The loader allows you to easily import
            one or more APIs, and specify additional settings (such as language, location,
            API version, etc.) applicable to your needs.
            
            In addition to the basic loader functionality, savvy developers can also use
            dynamic loading or auto-loading to enhance the performance of your application.

        stored into plone.app.registry, so you can use the provided control panel to
