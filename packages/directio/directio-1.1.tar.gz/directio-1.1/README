   The _directio_ module is an interface to open(), read(), write() and 
	 close on a direct I/O context (O_DIRECT flag) from the Python programming
	 language.
   
   These system calls are Linux system calls to
	   * open a file with the O_DIRECT flag, and close it.
	   * read or write from the file ignores the buffer cache.
   
	 The O_DIRECT flag introduced in SGI IRIX, where it has alignment
	 restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4. FreeBSD 4.x introduced a
	 flag of the same name, but without alignment restrictions. Support was
	 added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10. Older Linux kernels simply
	 ignore this flag.
	 Note that on a NFS file system, the flag O_DIRECT is ignored.
   
Version

   The current version of the _directio_ module is 1.0.
	 It should work on Linux 2.4.10 and higher. On older Linux kernels it would
	 work as a simple open/read/write ignoring the O_DIRECT flag.
