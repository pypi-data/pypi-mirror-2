Description: A plugin for TiddlyWeb that provides prettier error messages
        than the plain text straight exceptions provided by the
        TiddlyWeb core.
        
        The content is provided by tiddlers containing templated HTML.
        
        The tiddlers are provided via a recipe called errors made up of
        two bags. One contains the default error pages, the other is
        initially empty such that the ADMIN of the instance can do what
        they like.
        
        This is alpha-level software being developed for use with
        TiddlySpace. It requires TiddlyWeb 1.1.x which has not been
        packaged for release.
        
        See tiddlywebplugins.pretterror.exceptor for details.
