Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        quintagroup.seoptimizer was created to enhance SE visibility of Plone sites.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        quintagroup.seoptimizer allows per document editing of:
        
        * HTML Title tag
        
        * META description tag
        
        * META keywords tag
        
        * HTML comment into page header
        
        * META robots tag
        
        * META Disposition tag
        
        * Canonical URl (http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/qSEOptimizer#CanonicalURL)
        
        For Title, description keywords and comment you have statistics
        (total/stop/used words, field length counter).
        
        IMPORTANT
        ---------
        
        **Starting from 3.0 release - quintagroup.seoptimizer package does not need 'overrides.zcml' file. So please remove 'quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides' line from your buildout's ZCML area.**

        Installation
        ============
        
        Buildout
        --------
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ....
        eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/instance restart
        
        
        Traditional Zope 2 Instance
        ---------------------------
        
        To install quintagroup.seoptimizer into the global Python environment (or a workingenv), using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to your instance's */lib/python* directory.
        
        * Create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-configure.zcml`` in your instance's */etc/package-includes* directory. The file should only contain this::
        
        <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="configure.zcml" />
        
        * Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/zopectl restart
        
        
        Install quintagroup.seoptimizer via ZMI portal_setup  -> *Import* tab. Select ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
        
        Uninstallation
        ==============
        
        To uninstall quintagroup.seoptimizer - go to ZMI portal_setup  -> *Import* tab. Select ``quintagroup.seoptimizer uninstall`` profile from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
        
        Package Upgrade / Reinstall
        ===========================
        
        In case you want to upgrate quintagroup.seoptimizer to a newer version in your buildout:
        
        * Remove ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides`` from ``buildout.cfg`` file's ZCML area if it is there (starting from 3.0 release - quintagroup.seoptimizer package does not use overrides.zcml file any longer)
        
        * Upgrade quintagroup.seoptimizer to the newer version using buildout (rerun the buildout to replace old package with a new one in your instance)
        
        * Run the reinstall procedure: visit "Site Setup" -> "Add-ons" control panel in your Plone site, where you have to press quintagroup.seoptimizer button next to Upgrade. (The same can be done with quickinstaller via ZMI: at /portal_quickinstaller/manage_installProductsForm: check the seoptimizer box and press Reinstall button.) This is an essential step as new version of product introduces new persistent settings and ways to migrate settings/content from old to new version.
