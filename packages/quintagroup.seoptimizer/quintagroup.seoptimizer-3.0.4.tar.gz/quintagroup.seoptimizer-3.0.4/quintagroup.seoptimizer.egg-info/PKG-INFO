        Usage
        -----
        
        * Go to Plone Control Panel, enable Plone SEO for desired content types
        
        * Go to a document (Blog entry, news item, event, etc)
        
        * Switch to *SEO Properties* tab
        
        * Select *Override* checkboxes of features you want to override
        
        * Type-in your SEO values
        
        * Save changes
        
        * Do this for all documents that need enhanced SEO properties
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Plone 3.1.1+
        
        quintagroup.seoptimizer 3.0 was tested with Plone 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.
        
        Note
        ----
        
        * For Plone 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 versions - use Plone SEO 1.7.1  release (http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/1.7.1)
        
        * For Plone 3 version and up - use Plone SEO releases starting from 2.0.2 release (http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/2.0.2)
        
        * Starting from quintagroup.seoptimizer > 2.0.2 version global keywords support feature dropped - the following fields were removed from SEO Configlet: additional_keywords, settings_use_keywords_lg, and settings_use_keywords_lg. As a result, removed global keywords are now mixing with local ones from seo_context view.

        ============
        
        Buildout
        --------
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
        [buildout]
        ....
        eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
        $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/instance restart

        * Create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-configure.zcml`` in your instance's */etc/package-includes* directory. The file should only contain this::
        
        <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="configure.zcml" />
        
        * Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::
        
        $ ./bin/zopectl restart
