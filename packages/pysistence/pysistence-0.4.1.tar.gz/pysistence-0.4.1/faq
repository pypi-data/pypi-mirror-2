**Why the name pysistence?**

The project is named pysistence because most of the data structures it
implements are *persistent*.  This doesn't mean persistent in the sense that
they are stored in a database or the file system.  Rather, it means the data
structures may only be modified by copying.  Where possible, these data
structures will re-use existing implementations without copying everything.

**Where can I learn more about persistent data structures?**

Here are some resouces:

 * `Developing for Developers:  Persistent data structures <http://blogs.msdn.com/devdev/archive/2005/11/08/490480.aspx>`_
 * `Persistent data structures (wikipedia) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure>`_

Or if you're *really* brave:

 * `Making Data Structures Persistent <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/another-persistence.pdf>`_
 * `Purely Functional Data Structures <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf>`_
