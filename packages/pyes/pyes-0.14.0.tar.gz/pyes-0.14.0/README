pyes is a connector to use elasticsearch from python.

This version requires elasticsearch 0.12 or above.

Features
========

- Thrift/HTTP protocols
- Bulk insert
- Index management
- Every search query types
- Facet Support
- Geolocalization support
- Highlighting
- Initial River support

Connecting
==========

These function are taken from pycassa.

Import the module:

    >>> import pyes

pyes is able to use standard http or thrift protocol. If your port starts with "92" http protocol is used, otherwise thrift.


For a single connection (which is _not_ thread-safe), pass a list of servers.

For thrift:

    >>> client = pyes.connect() # Defaults to connecting to the server at '127.0.0.1:9500'
    >>> client = pyes.connect(['127.0.0.1:9500'])

For http:

    >>> client = pyes.connect(['127.0.0.1:9200'])


With thrift protocol, framed transport is the default. You may disable it by passing framed_transport=False.

    >>> client = pyes.connect(framed_transport=False)

Thread-local connections opens a connection for every thread that calls an ElasticSearch function. It also automatically balances the number of connections between servers, unless round_robin=False.

    >>> client = pyes.connect_thread_local() # Defaults to connecting to the server at '127.0.0.1:9500'
    >>> client = pyes.connect_thread_local(['127.0.0.1:9500', 'other_server:9500']) # Round robin connections
    >>> client = pyes.connect_thread_local(['127.0.0.1:9500', 'other_server:9500'], round_robin=False) # Connect in list order

With http protocol transport:

    >>> client = pyes.connect_thread_local(['127.0.0.1:9200', 'other_server:9200']) # Round robin connections
    >>> client = pyes.connect_thread_local(['127.0.0.1:9200', 'other_server:9200'], round_robin=False) # Connect in list order

Connections are robust to server failures. Upon a disconnection, it will attempt to connect to each server in the list in turn. If no server is available, it will raise a NoServerAvailable exception.

Timeouts are also supported and should be used in production to prevent a thread from freezing while waiting for the server to return.

    >>> client = pyes.connect(timeout=3.5) # 3.5 second timeout
    (Make some pyes calls and the connection to the server suddenly becomes unresponsive.)

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    pyes.connection.NoServerAvailable

Note that this only handles socket timeouts. 


Usage
=====

Creating a connection:

    >>> from pyes import *
    >>> conn = ES('127.0.0.1:9500')

Deleting an index:

    >>> try:
    >>>     conn.delete_index("test-index")
    >>> except:
    >>>     pass

(an exception is fored if the index is not present)

Create an index:

    >>> conn.create_index("test-index")

Creating a mapping:

    >>> mapping = { u'parsedtext': {'boost': 1.0,
    >>>                  'index': 'analyzed',
    >>>                  'store': 'yes',
    >>>                  'type': u'string',
    >>>                  "term_vector" : "with_positions_offsets"},
    >>>          u'name': {'boost': 1.0,
    >>>                     'index': 'analyzed',
    >>>                     'store': 'yes',
    >>>                     'type': u'string',
    >>>                     "term_vector" : "with_positions_offsets"},
    >>>          u'title': {'boost': 1.0,
    >>>                     'index': 'analyzed',
    >>>                     'store': 'yes',
    >>>                     'type': u'string',
    >>>                     "term_vector" : "with_positions_offsets"},
    >>>          u'pos': {'store': 'yes',
    >>>                     'type': u'integer'},
    >>>          u'uuid': {'boost': 1.0,
    >>>                    'index': 'not_analyzed',
    >>>                    'store': 'yes',
    >>>                    'type': u'string'}}
    >>> conn.put_mapping("test-type", {'properties':mapping}, ["test-index"])

Index some documents:

    >>> conn.index({"name":"Joe Tester", "parsedtext":"Joe Testere nice guy", "uuid":"11111", "position":1}, "test-index", "test-type", 1)
    >>> conn.index({"name":"Bill Baloney", "parsedtext":"Joe Testere nice guy", "uuid":"22222", "position":2}, "test-index", "test-type", 2)

Refresh an index:

    >>> conn.refresh(["test-index"])

Execute a query

    >>> q = TermQuery("name", "joe")
    >>> result = self.conn.search(query = q)

For more examples looks at the tests.
