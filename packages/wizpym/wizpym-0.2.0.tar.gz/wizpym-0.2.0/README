The wizpym module provides a light framework to build wizard-like
applications with GTK.

A wizard, as defined by wizpym, is an application that is built as a
succession of panes, each one asking some input to the user or working
on previous inputs. The whole wizard works on one object, called the
subject, which is shared and updated by each one of the panes.

The pane track can fork upon some inputs or any other environment
data. The wizard also maintains a full history of the track, with the
status of reverted panes. Thus the user can return down to the
beginning, and forwarding preserves the previous status of a pane if
already visited.

A sample useless application is provided and is executed if the module
is called as a script.
