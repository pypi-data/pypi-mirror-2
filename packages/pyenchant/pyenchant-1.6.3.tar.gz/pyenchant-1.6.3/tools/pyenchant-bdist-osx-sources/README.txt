The PyEnchant binary distribution contains prebuilt libraries for
enchant and its dependencies.  This directory contains the source
for those libraries, in compliance with a strict interpretation
of the GPL/LGPL.

The enchant library is a very slightly modified version of the latest
enchant release, the patches can be found in the "patches" directory.

The remaining libraries were built by Tor Lillqvist and were obtained
from his website at:
