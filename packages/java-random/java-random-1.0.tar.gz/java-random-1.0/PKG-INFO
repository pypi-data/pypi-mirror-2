Description: ===========
        Java-Random
        ===========
        
        Java-Random is a simple implementation of Java's standard java.util.Random
        class in Python. Java's random number generation algorithm is exceedingly
        straightforward to reimplement in other languages, and this is simply an
        implementation for Python.
        
        Installation

        FAQ
        ====
        
        Why would you do this?
         I needed this particular generator available in another program, and this was
         the quickest, simplest way to achieve that goal.
        
        What's wrong with Python's random module?
         Nothing. In fact, Python's random module is far superior to this module in a
         number of respects, including predictability, speed, robustness, and
         features. If you're looking for good random number generation in Python, just
         use random instead.
        
        Your code sucks.
         That's not a question. Also, feel free to blame the Java specification for
         that, as they have a very specific way of doing things and I felt that trying
         to spice up my code might lead to some unobvious and unfun bugs.
        
        Where is the official Java specification for this, anyway?
         http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html, until
         Oracle removes it.
        
        ...This is for Minecraft, isn't it?
