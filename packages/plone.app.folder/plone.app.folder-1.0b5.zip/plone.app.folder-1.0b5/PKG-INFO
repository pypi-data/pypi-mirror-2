        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides base classes for folderish `Archetypes`_ /
        `ATContentTypes`_ content types based on `B-trees`_, a.k.a. "large folders"
        in Plone_.  Storing content in such folders provides significant
        `performance benefits`_ over regular folders.

        The package only contains the integration layer for the base class provided
        by `plone.folder`_, however.  Please see there for more detailed information.

        Caveats
        -------
        
        If you are using `plone.app.folder` in your product you may notice that
        PloneTestCase will fail to setup a Plone site for your functional tests.
        This can be resolved by adding this line to your functional test source::
        
        from plone.app.folder.tests import bbb

        * Replace monkey patch for `Catalog._getSortIndex` with a fake index that
