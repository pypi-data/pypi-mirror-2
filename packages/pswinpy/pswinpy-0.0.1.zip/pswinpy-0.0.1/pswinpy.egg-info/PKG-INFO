Description: PSWinCom Python Package
        =======================
        
        A Python interface to the [PSWinCom SMS Gateway](http://pswin.com/english/products/gateway).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The pswinpy package is distributed through PyPI as both egg, Windows and source. THIS IS NOT YET TRUE!!
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        To use this package, you will need sign up for a Gateway account with PSWinCom. Demo account are available.
        
        This piece of code demonstrates how to send a simple SMS message:
        
        from pswinpy import API
        api = API("myUsername", "myPassword")
        api.sendSms(4712345678, "Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government!")
        
        Properties
        ----------
        Receiver and message text are the two mandatory properties when sending a message. You may specify additional properties by using named arguments.
        
        For instance this is how you would specify a sender:
        
        api.sendSms(4712345678, "It's just a flesh wound.", sender="BlackKnight")
        
        Properties currently supported are:
        
        * sender
        * TTL - time to live in minutes
        * tariff - the amount (in local currency as cents/"&oslash;rer") to charge the receiver
        * serviceCode - service code for sending GAS messages. Requires that tariff is set. See [wiki](http://wiki.pswin.com/CPA-Goods-and-Services.ashx) for details.
        * deliveryTime - a datetime object specifying when to send the message
        
        Specifying Host
        ---------------
        The package is set to use a particular PSWinCom SMS Gateway by default. The host can be changed globaly by setting the host class property on HttpSender:
        
        HttpSender.host = "some.other.host.com"
        
        Modes
        -----
        For testing purposes the API provides a couple of modes you can set globally to control how the library works.
        
        Mode.test = True
        
        .. will make you use the API without actually sending any messages.
        
        Mode.debug = True
        
        .. will make the API output debug information to standard out.
