        Overview
        ********
        
        This package implements an easy way to configure a CDN to distribute skin
        elements of your site, thus reducing server accesses and improving response
        time.
        
        sc.base.cdn as developed initially as a proof of concept and it's shipped with
        three different providers:
        
        * Coral CDN
        * AlternateHostname
        * MultipleHostnames
        
        
        Requirements
        ************
        
        **sc.base.cdn** has been tested with:
        
        * Plone 3.3.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        To use this package, on a buildout based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.base.cdn``
        to the list of eggs to install ::
        
        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        sc.base.cdn
        
        2. Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        zcml =
        ...
        sc.base.cdn
        
        
        If another package depends on the sc.base.cdn egg or
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Post-Installation
        *****************
        
        This package installs a control panel on your Plone instance. To access it
        point your browser at http://<address_to_your_plone_site/@@cdn-controlpanel .
        
        The CDN Control Panel allows you to enable/disable the CDN support and also
        choose which CDN provider you plan to use.
        
        Providers
        *********
        
        This package is bundled with three **very basic** CDN providers. Each one of
        them could be used in production but it's possible to deploy new ones.
        
        CoralCDN
        --------
        
        CoralCDN is a decentralized, self-organizing, peer-to-peer web-content
        distribution network. CoralCDN leverages the aggregate bandwidth of volunteers
        running the software to absorb and dissipate most of the traffic for web sites
        using the system. In so doing, CoralCDN replicates content in proportion to the
        content's popularity, regardless of the publisher's resources.[#]_
        
        Our implementation basically appends the .nyud.net sufix to urls generated by
        resource registries (like portal_javascripts, portal_css, portal_kss).
        
        AlternateHostname
        -----------------
        
        This provider allows you to designate an alternate hostname to serve skin
        resources for your portal.
        A very basic example would be to add 127.0.0.1 as an alternate hostname --
        using same port number as your zope instance -- during development, thus enabling
        resources to be downloaded from 127.0.0.1 while content will be served from
        localhost.
        
        MultipleHostnames
        -----------------
        
        Acting in a similar way to AlternateHostname provider, MultipleHostnames allows
        you to type in multiple values for hostname.
        
        When the absolute_url method from a resource registry is called, we use choice
        to pick one of the available hostnames and return it to the browser.
        
        Using MultipleHostnames allows you to serve content from a hostname while
        resources will be called from up to 3 other addresses -- one for each registry.
