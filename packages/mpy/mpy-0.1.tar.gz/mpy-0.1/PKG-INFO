Description: 
        MPY stands for ``MPi for pYthon'', is a single-module wrapper for any MPI
        library.  Just copy the mpy.py then it works (needless to say, after you have
        MPI installed on a cluster).  MPY has no external dependency other than a
        working MPI installation and a standard Python.  The MPI installation has to
        be built with shared object since MPY uses ctypes as interface.
        
        All the functions in the MPI library can be accessed by
        MPI().Name_Without_Leading_MPI(), and you must manually convert the arguments
        from Python objects to ctypes objects.  Shorthand APIs and Pythonic APIs are
        also provided.  Shorthand APIs use Python objects and can return Python
        objects, with the same naming convention as MPI, but all lower-cased.  Pythonic
        APIs are Pythonic.
        
        You can verify the ``installation'' of MPY by running::
        
        $ mpiexec -n 2 python mpy.py
