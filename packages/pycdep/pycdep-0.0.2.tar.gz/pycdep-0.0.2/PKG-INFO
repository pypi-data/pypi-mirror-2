        .. PyCDep is a tool to analyze and visualize dependencies between code and header files in C and C++ programs.
        .. Source code is mined by a python script, and all the information is dumped in a prolog database.
        .. Prolog then allows to perform powerful analysis of our header files. The system comes with a large
        .. number of pre-defined queries, ready for you to run.
        .. Visualization is possible by dumping .dot files for visualization with graphviz.
        .. You can also define constraints between projects (e.g. project src can include from project lib, but not vice versa)
        .. and let the tool list the violations it found.

        0.0.2
        -----
        * New feature
          * sorting include files by importance
        * Order of magnitude speed up
        * Bug fixes:
          * removed undesired remaining choicepoints in several prolog predicates
          * files ending in .sh are considered header files of "h" is defined as header file suffix
          * add missing dependency on python project argparse in setup.py
          * problems with window sloppy file name case on linux systems
          * do not bail out during full_report generation if no hierarchy constraints are defined
          * clean up prolog predicates by removing unused arguments
          * be smarter about where to find the prolog template, allowing to start pycdep from any folder
          * problems with win32 path handling due to refactorings for speed optimization
