.. PyCDep is a tool to analyze and visualize dependencies between code and header files in C and C++ programs.
.. Source code is mined by a python script, and all the information is dumped in a prolog database.
.. Prolog then allows to perform powerful analysis of our header files. The system comes with a large
.. number of pre-defined queries, ready for you to run.
.. Visualization is possible by dumping .dot files for visualization with graphviz.
.. You can also define constraints between projects (e.g. project src can include from project lib, but not vice versa)
.. and let the tool list the violations it found.
