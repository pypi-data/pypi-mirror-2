Description: Imaged event
        ============
        
        An enhanced version of the base Plone event content type.
        
        Image field
        -----------
        
        After intalling this you'll see that the Plone event will have a new **image field** and **caption**
        like the News Item content type.
        
        As News Item do, the event now behave **image resize** functionality.
        
        Event type field
        ----------------
        
        It this kind of event the *Subject* and *Event type* fields has been splitted and are now two
        distinct data.
        
        If you are using an older version of this product, you can run the proper upgrade step to fix all
        old values.
        
        Plone 4
        =======
        
        The product is *stable*, and heavily used in production, on Plone 3.3.
        
        Plone 4 compatibility has been provided but is still *beta* and not so tested. Plone 4 has changed
        some stuff in the Event schema so not al features of image event are there.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Better Plone 4 compatibility
        * Fixing schema difference from Plone 3 and Plone 4
