Description: Eventer is a simple event dispaching library.
        
        It provides a simple API to bind and trigger custom named events. Events do not have to be declared before they are bound. ::
        
        import eventer
        
        def on_edit(page):
        subject = page.path + " is edited"
        sendmail(subject=subject)
        
        eventer.bind("edit", on_edit)
        
        eventer.trigger("edit", page)
        
        The API is inspired by event handling in jQuery_ and backbone.js_.
