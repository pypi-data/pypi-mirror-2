0.9.0
+++++

* make reusing one tab/window and the corresponding browser test
  object for all tests using the same setup in a session the default,
  this is enforced when using py.test 2.0 which collects all tests
  first

* *py.test 2.0 is now supported!* py.test 1.x still works as well

* display during the test runs a list of links on the upper right
  corner of the pages to jump to the outcome sections corresponding to the
  JavaScript test files or python modules

* various internal cleanups and simplifications

* some light refreshing and editing of the docs

* fix the looking up of jstests_setup values to consider the chain of
  conftest.py correctly

* MochiKit usage is really an implementation detail, switch to by
  default in tests importing it with ``__export__=false``, which means
  the name MochiKit alone is defined in the global (window) namespace,
  use in a jstests_setup::

      class jstests_setup:
          MochiKit__export__ = True

  to get the old behavior.

0.8.9
+++++

* optionally delegate to the serverSide how the baseurl from which tests will be served should look like, useful when doing proxying  for functional testing abuse of oejskit
* change packaging to just offer a source tar file, so that makes it easier to package
* requires Python 2.6 or 2.7

0.8.8
+++++

* improved code to check for the presence of browsers which is used to skip
  tests, this means that listing non-present browsers in browser specs
  should not provoke problems
* workaround to bug in FF3.5 triggered by the global var leak detection code,
  no leak detection with FF3.5 :(

0.8.7
+++++

* flexible ``user-defined-name=commandline`` control over browser names
  for ``browser.py server`` with documentation
* document the glue to standard library unittest.py 
* better error reporting when a browser cannot be started
* use json module included in Python >=2.6, simplejson otherwise
* move the py.test plugin into the oejskit package, expose it through a pytest11 setuptools entry point
* fix own-tests-only issues and warnings with py.test 1.1.x 

0.8.6
++++++

* fixes for py.test 1.0 final compatibility
* experimental glue to standard library unittest.py (no docs yet)
