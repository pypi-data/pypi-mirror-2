Description: jskit
        =======
        
        jskit contains infrastructure and in particular a `py.test`_  plugin to
        enable running tests for JavaScript code inside browsers directly
        using py.test as the test driver. Running inside the browsers comes
        with some speed cost, on the other hand it means for example the code
        is tested against the real-world DOM implementations.
        
        .. _`py.test`: http://pytest.org/
        
        The approach also enables to write integration tests such that the
        JavaScript code is tested against server-side Python code mocked as
        necessary. Any server-side framework that can already be exposed
        through WSGI (or for which a subset of WSGI can be written to
        accommodate the jskit own needs) can play along.
        
        jskit has also some support to run JavaScript tests from ``unittest.py`` based
        test suites.
        
        jskit also contains code to help modularizing JavaScript code
        which can be used to describe and track dependencies dynamically
        during development and that can help resolving them statically when
        deploying/packaging.
        
        Known supported browsers are Firefox, Internet Explorer >=7, and
        WebKit browsers.
        
        *jskit now supports both py.test 2.0 and late py.test 1.x.*
        
        jskit requires Python 2.6 or 2.7. It also uses `MochiKit`_ - of
        which it ships a version within itself for convenience - for its own
        working though in does not imposes its usage on tested code.
        
        .. _`MochiKit`: http://mochikit.com/
        
        jskit was initially developed by *Open End* AB and is released under the MIT license.

        Changelog
        -----------
        0.9.0
        +++++
        
        * make reusing one tab/window and the corresponding browser test
          object for all tests using the same setup in a session the default,
          this is enforced when using py.test 2.0 which collects all tests
          first
        
        * *py.test 2.0 is now supported!* py.test 1.x still works as well
        
        * display during the test runs a list of links on the upper right
          corner of the pages to jump to the outcome sections corresponding to the
          JavaScript test files or python modules
        
        * various internal cleanups and simplifications
        
        * some light refreshing and editing of the docs
        
        * fix the looking up of jstests_setup values to consider the chain of
          conftest.py correctly
        
        * MochiKit usage is really an implementation detail, switch to by
          default in tests importing it with ``__export__=false``, which means
          the name MochiKit alone is defined in the global (window) namespace,
          use in a jstests_setup::
        
              class jstests_setup:
                  MochiKit__export__ = True
        
          to get the old behavior.
        
        0.8.9
        +++++
        
        * optionally delegate to the serverSide how the baseurl from which tests will be served should look like, useful when doing proxying  for functional testing abuse of oejskit
        * change packaging to just offer a source tar file, so that makes it easier to package
        * requires Python 2.6 or 2.7
        
        0.8.8
        +++++
        
        * improved code to check for the presence of browsers which is used to skip
          tests, this means that listing non-present browsers in browser specs
          should not provoke problems
        * workaround to bug in FF3.5 triggered by the global var leak detection code,
          no leak detection with FF3.5 :(
        
        0.8.7
        +++++
        
        * flexible ``user-defined-name=commandline`` control over browser names
          for ``browser.py server`` with documentation
        * document the glue to standard library unittest.py 
        * better error reporting when a browser cannot be started
        * use json module included in Python >=2.6, simplejson otherwise
        * move the py.test plugin into the oejskit package, expose it through a pytest11 setuptools entry point
        * fix own-tests-only issues and warnings with py.test 1.1.x 
        
        0.8.6
        ++++++
        
        * fixes for py.test 1.0 final compatibility
        * experimental glue to standard library unittest.py (no docs yet)
