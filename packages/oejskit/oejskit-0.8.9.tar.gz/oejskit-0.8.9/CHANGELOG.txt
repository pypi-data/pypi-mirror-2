0.8.9
+++++

* optionally delegate to the serverSide how the baseurl from which tests will be served should look like, useful when doing proxying  for functional testing abuse of oejskit
* change packaging to just offer a source tar file, so that makes it easier to package
* requires Python 2.6 or 2.7

0.8.8
+++++

* improved code to check for the presence of browsers which is used to skip
  tests, this means that listing non-present browsers in browser specs
  should not provoke problems
* workaround to bug in FF3.5 triggered by the global var leak detection code,
  no leak detection with FF3.5 :(

0.8.7
+++++

* flexible ``user-defined-name=commandline`` control over browser names
  for ``browser.py server`` with documentation
* document the glue to standard library unittest.py 
* better error reporting when a browser cannot be started
* use json module included in Python >=2.6, simplejson otherwise
* move the py.test plugin into the oejskit package, expose it through a pytest11 setuptools entry point
* fix own-tests-only issues and warnings with py.test 1.1.x 

0.8.6
++++++

* fixes for py.test 1.0 final compatibility
* experimental glue to standard library unittest.py (no docs yet)
