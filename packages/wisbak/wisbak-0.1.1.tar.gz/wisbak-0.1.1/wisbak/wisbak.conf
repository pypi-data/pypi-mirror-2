# IMPORTANT PARAMETERS
# you MUST set these up before wisbak will run
# Advanced users: this file will be read with python execfile: you can use
# python code to do whatever you want to come up with these settings, or
# to initialize stuff before wisbak does anything.

# You must setup an encryption for yourself!
# I suggest you use the excellent apg utility to generate it, like so:
# apg -a1 -M LNCS -m 20 -n1
# If you change this, wisbak will not be able to append to your old backup
# media, you'll have to reconfig them with 'wisbak.py -a'
key="CHANGEME"

# These are UUIDs for your backup disks; when you setup a new disk to backup 
# to, wisbak will spit out its UUID at the end -> add it here.
# Advanced users who set up their own encrypted media can add the UUID here
# as well.
# example:
#	disks=("42e58e2f-35f4-4586-ac17-26549b11fdfd", 
#	       "b0097a46-39c5-4389-a21f-96792a42fb36")
disks=()

# Email settings, so wisbak can email you a detailed report after each run
# where to send reports to; set to '' if you don't want to send the report
admin_email=''
# who the email should say its from
from_email='backup@bar.com'
# server and port to use to send the email
# if server requires authentication, set username and password
smtp_server={'host': 'localhost', 'port': 25, 
			 'username': None, 'password': None,
			 'use_tls': False, 'use_ssl': False}

# list the files and dirs to be excluded from backup in this file
exclude_file='%(dir)s/.wisbak_exclude.txt'

# note that the backup user must be able to write to the snap file
snap_file='$HOME/.wisbak_snap-%(hashed_dir)s.txt'

# ssh as this user to the remote hosts; the user must be able to ssh
# without a password to each host listed in backup_hosts
connect_as='backup'

# put runtime data in this directory on the backup server
runtime_data='/var/lib/wisbak'

# log messages to global logfile
# this doesn't impact the emailed report and console messages
logfile = '/var/log/wisbak.log'

# list of hosts and directories to back up
# note that wisbak will NOT cross filesystem boundaries. This means that if
# you backup /home on host foo, and bob has mounted a usb key into 
# /home/bob/mnt/my_usb_key, the contents of the key will NOT be backed up.
# if you want to back it up, setup a separate backup target for 
# /home/bob/mnt/my_usb_key
# An example list is given here
#	backup_hosts=(('localhost', ('/', '/usr/local', '/home', 
#                                '/home/esj/mnt/SANDRA/MyDocuments')), 
#	              ('strange', ('/', '/home')), 
#                 ('wwd.ca', ('/',)))
