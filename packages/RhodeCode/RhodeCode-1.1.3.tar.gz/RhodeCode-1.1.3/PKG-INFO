Description: 
        =================================================
        Welcome to RhodeCode (RhodiumCode) documentation!
        =================================================
        
        ``RhodeCode`` (formerly hg-app) is Pylons framework based Mercurial repository
        browser/management with build in push/pull server and full text search.
        It works on http/https, has build in permission/authentication(+ldap) features
        It's similar to github or bitbucket, but it's suppose to run as standalone
        hosted application, it's open source and focuses more on restricted access to
        repositories. It's powered by vcs_ library that me and Lukasz Balcerzak created
        to handle many various version control systems.
        
        RhodeCode uses `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_

        The default access is anonymous but You can login to administrative account
        using those credentials

        Source code
        -----------
        
        The most up to date sources can be obtained from my own RhodeCode instance
        https://rhodecode.org
        
        Rarely updated source code and issue tracker is available at bitbcuket
        http://bitbucket.org/marcinkuzminski/rhodecode
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Please visit http://packages.python.org/RhodeCode/installation.html
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Has it's own middleware to handle mercurial_ protocol request.
        Each request can be logged and authenticated. Runs on threads unlikely to
        hgweb. You can make multiple pulls/pushes simultaneous. Supports http/https
        and ldap
        - Full permissions (private/read/write/admin) and authentication per project.
        One account for web interface and mercurial_ push/pull/clone operations.
        - Mako templates let's you customize look and feel of application.
        - Beautiful diffs, annotations and source codes all colored by pygments.
        - Mercurial_ branch graph and yui-flot powered graphs with zooming and statistics
        - Admin interface with user/permission management. Admin activity journal, logs
        pulls, pushes, forks, registrations and other actions made by all users.
        - Server side forks, it's possible to fork a project and hack it free without
        breaking the main repository.
        - Full text search powered by Whoosh on source codes, and file names.
        Build in indexing daemons, with optional incremental index build
        (no external search servers required all in one application)
        - Setup project descriptions and info inside built in db for easy, non
        file-system operations
        - Inteligent cache with invalidation after push or project change, provides high
        performance and always up to date data.
        - Rss / atom feeds, gravatar support, download sources as zip/tar/gz
        - Async tasks for speed and performance using celery_ (works without them too)
        - Backup scripts can do backup of whole app and send it over scp to desired
        location
        - Based on pylons / sqlalchemy / sqlite / whoosh / vcs

        ----------------
        
        - project grouping
        - User groups/teams

        - full git_ support, with push/pull server (currently in beta tests)
        - redmine integration
        - public accessible activity feeds
        - commit based build in wiki system
