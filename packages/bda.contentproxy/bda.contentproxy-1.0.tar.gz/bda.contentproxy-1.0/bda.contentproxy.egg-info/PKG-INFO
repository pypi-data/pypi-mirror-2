        Overview
        ========
        
        Module providing some flavour of content proxy for Plone. It works for all
        kinds of Archetypes based types.
        
        Consider that the Archetypes UID must be present in the portal_catalog
        (default in plone 3) and the view for the Type must come along with
        a ``main`` macro in it's view, i.e.::
        
        <metal:main fill-slot="main">
        <tal:main-macro metal:define-macro="main">
        
        <!-- type view goes here -->
        
        </tal:main-macro>
        </metal:main>
        
        This macro is called on the proxied content and is inserted into the ``main``
        slot of the ``main_template`` in the current context.
        
        Two kinds of proxy behaviour are provided:
        
        - A placeless proxy
        
        This is a simple BrowserView named ``proxy``, with its own
        traverser resolving the trailing part of the URL as the Archetype UID, i.e.::
        
        http://your.domain.net/some/path/@@proxy/0c6e067822a520eabcfdd1e67d209d96
        
        - The other way is a simple Archetype with a UID reference field
        The first kind of proxy may takes place when rendering search results,
        the other one might be used to insert *remote* content to a specified place
        in the folder hirarchy.
        
        
        KSS
        ===
        
        Archetypes provides inline editing stuff. Since the proxied content is indeed
        rendered as is, the KSS rules for archetypes apply, but on the wrong context,
        so we set a condition inside the kssregistry on at.kss resource to determine
        wether it should be loaded or not.
        
        If you use the proxy not via the placeless proxy or the proxy type, but out
        of your own application, you might have to add your own conditional rule to
        avoid at.kss to be loaded. This can be done by the IContentProxiedRule
        interface.
        
        To provide your custom rule, implement this interface and register your object
        as multiadapter for context and request, i.e.::
        
        <adapter
        for="foo.bar.interfaces.IBaz
        zope.publisher.interfaces.http.IHTTPRequest"
        factory="foo.bar.baz.Baz"
        />
        
        A Base Rule object as well as a default rule object exist in
        bda.contentproxy.proxy. The default rule is registered for ``*``. if you want to
        provide your own general rule, you have to define your rule implementation in
        an overrides.zcml, but its strongly recommended to avoid this due to several
        applications registering their own general rules, that might end in confusing
        side effects. better bind to the context interface explicit.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. Make the egg available in your instance,
        
        2. Make sure to have ``bda.resultduplexer`` available
        
        3. Import the bda.contentproxy extension profile in your plone instance.
        
        This Product is tested with Plone 3.0

        [jensens] 2010-08-31
        --------------------
        
        - version handling in setup.py
        
        ---------
        1.0 beta6
        ---------
        
        [rnix] 2010-03-10
        -----------------
        
        - remove resultduplexer dependency. resultduplexer depends on contentproxy now.
        
        - try to lookup browser view by template name before calling main macro.
        
        [maurits] 2009-12-09
        --------------------
        
        - version increase

        1.0 beta5
        ---------
        
        [maurits] 2009-12-09
        --------------------
        
        - Find the referenced object via the uid_catalog instead of the
        portal_catalog so a clear and rebuild of the portal_catalog does not
        throw a ContentLookupError when the proxy is indexed before its
        referenced proxied content.

        -----------------
        
        - Added Interface to define at.kss loading rule
        
        - Use a browserview for the expression used in kssregistry to determine wether
        to load at.kss or not. This ensures the ability to customize the condition
        logic.
        
        - Made this module installable via Quickinstaller.
        
        [rnix] 2008-02-28

        -----------------
        
        - added css file to overwrite the :hover event on .inlineEditable classed
        elements
        
        - added kssregistry and added expression to at.kss not to be loaded when proxy
        type or placeless proxy view is displayed to disable inline editing. in
        future this might be done by kss or js directly with some kind of event
        unbinding instead of dirty resource registry conditions.
