Description: Easy storage of tabular data
        ============================
        
        
        collective.table is a replacement for the "store equipment lists, book loans,
        etc. in Excel files and upload to Plone". It's a list of items where members
        can add/edit columns and rows and of course data. By default, collective.table
        stores it's data in the ZODB, however storage is pluggable and it's easy to
        write storage adapters to have data stored in SQL, LDAP, etc.
        
        collective.table is based on `DataTables <http://datatables.net>`_ and
        `jEditable <http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable>`_ jQuery plugins.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install collective.table you simply add "collective.table" to the list of
        eggs in your buildout, run buildout and restart the Plone server. In Plone's
        portal_quickinstaller you select "collective.table" and install it.
        
        Now you can add a Table content-type and start adding your tabular data.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Upon adding a new table you have to specify which columns you would like. You
        do that by entering column names, one per line, into `columns` field. When you
        click save your table will be created, containing one initial row. At the
        moment, all columns are of type `string`.
        
        Edit
        ----
        Double-click on a cell of your choosing and enter something. Hitting `Enter`
        will save this value.
        
        Add a new row
        -------------
        Click the `Create a new row` button and a new row will be appended, which you
        can  edit to enter your data.
        
        Deleting a row
        --------------
        Start by selecting a row by clicking on it. Then click the `Delete this row`
        button and this row will be deleted. You can select and delete multiple rows.
        
        Roadmap
        =======
        
        Current status
        --------------
        
        At this point, collective.table offers only basic functionalities and is somewhat
        usable. It's in alpha stage so storage API *will* change and there will be
        *no migration path*. Do not use for storing important data just yet!
        
        Milestone `Sauna Sprint`
        ------------------------
        
        Both Nejc Zupan (GSoC student) and Martijn Pieters (mentor) will be attending
        the Plone Sauna Sprint 2011. During that week we will focus on the following:
        
        * improve ZODB storage (sorting, filtering, scalability and such)
        * improve UI
        * add more tests (test coverage is already above 85%, btw)
        * unit-tests for Javascript
        
        Milestone `End of GSoC`
        -----------------------
        
        * battle-hardening what we produce during the Sauna Sprint
        * selenium tests, ran regularly with help of jenkins.plone.org
        * improve user and developer documentation
        * export data to csv, etc
        * screencast usage demo
        
        Milestone `future`
        ------------------
        
        * column types (numeric, date, boolean, vocabularies, etc.)
        * add SQLAlchemy storage, based on SQLite by default
        * import from csv
        * insertion of rows in the middle, together with concurrent editing
