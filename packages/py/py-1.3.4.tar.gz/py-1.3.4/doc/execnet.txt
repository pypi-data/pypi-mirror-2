py.execnet: *elastic* distributed programming
==============================================================================

Since pylib 1.1 "py.execnet" ceased to exist and is now available
as a separately developed `execnet standalone package`_.

If you have previosly used "py.execnet.*" and the 1.0 API just
rename all occurences of the string "``py.execnet.``" with the
string "``execnet.``" as execnet-1.0 is API compatible.
