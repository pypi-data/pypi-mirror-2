sp    -- specifies the pointer to the variable into which the size of

If successful, the return value is the pointer to the region of the
value of the column of the corresponding record.  'NULL' is returned
if no record corresponds or there is no column.

Because an additional zero code is appended at the end of the region
of the return value, the return value can be treated as a character
string.  Because the region of the return value is allocated with the
'malloc' call, it should be released with the 'free' call when it is
no longer in use.
