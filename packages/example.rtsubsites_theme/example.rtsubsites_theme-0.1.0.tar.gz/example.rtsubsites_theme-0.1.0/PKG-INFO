        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is only an example Plone theme, to be used for testing in a simple way all the
        `redturtle.subsites`__ features.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/redturtle.subsites
        
        For a complete list of the features, and for know how to configure properly Apache in front
        of Plone, refer to the documentation.
        
        This is a silly `Sunburst`__ extensions with:
        
        * a different logo image
        * an additional image in the logo viewlet
        * a custom CSS (that make all more gray)
        * a custom JavaScript (that display "Welcome To The demo")
        * a customized main_template where the footer has been removed

        Example details
        ===============
        
        Let say that you have a Plone site accessible through http://mycompany.com/ , where you didn't
        applied any Plone theme (so probably Sunburst base theme).
        
        This will be your back-end URL.

        Accessing the Subsite
        ---------------------
        
        If properly configured, when you access the **front-end URL**, you will see the new theme with all it's
        customizations.

        You can also visit a subsite sub-sections:

        If you don't provide the optional RequestHeader
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        As said in the documentation, the use of the `Apache RequestHeader`__ can be optional for some themes.
        Here how you will see the subsite if not provided properly.
        
        __ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_headers.html#requestheader
        
        .. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/example.rtsubsites_theme-0.1.0-03.png

        As you can see, all CMF skins customization (site logo and main_template) are lost.
        
        If your theme don't provide a custom viewlet logo
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        These theme provide a custom logo viewlet that properly use the redturtle.subsites basic ones, as
        described in the documentation.
        
        You need a new logo viewlet only if you need something different from Plone standard as in this example (where
        we have two images in the logo).
        
        Disabling this viewlet will show the subsite as follow:

        A .conf Apache configuration file
        ---------------------------------
        
        Here a part of the Apache configuration file for use this theme with a subpath (http://mycompany.com/subsite)::
        
            ServerName mycompany.com
            ServerAlias www.mycompany.com
            ServerAdmin ...
            
            ...
            
            RewriteEngine On
            
            SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/subsite(.*)" SUBSITE
            RequestHeader append plone_skin "Example Theme for redturtle.subsites" env=SUBSITE
            
            RewriteRule ^/subsite(.*) \
            "http://127.0.0.1:8080/VirtualHostBase/http/%{SERVER_NAME}:80/Plone/++skin++Example Theme for redturtle.subsites/VirtualHostRoot/subsite/$1" [L,P]
            ProxyPassReverse /subsite http://127.0.0.1:8080/
            
            RewriteRule ^/(.*) \
            "http://127.0.0.1:8080/VirtualHostBase/http/%{SERVER_NAME}:80/Plone/VirtualHostRoot/$1" [L,P]
