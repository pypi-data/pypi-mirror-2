Introduction
============

:ref:`weblayer` is a `Python`_ package, built on `WebOb`_, that provides a set
of components that can be used to handle requests within a `WSGI`_ application.

It is not a framework.  In contrast, :ref:`weblayer` tries to prescribe as
little as possible, allowing you to swap out components and work with your
weapons of choice.

It's fast and fully tested.  The `source code`_ is `public domain`_.
