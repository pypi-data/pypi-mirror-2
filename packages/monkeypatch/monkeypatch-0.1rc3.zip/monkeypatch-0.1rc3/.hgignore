# Ignores the specified file/directory regexp/glob patterns
# from being tracked in a mercurial repository.
#
# An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository root directory,
# or any prefix path of that path, is matched.
# Files are only ignored when being added or updated.
# Untrack already tracked files with `hg rm -Af filename`.
# Force adding or updating ignored file with `hg add -f filename`.
#
# Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
# You can use 'syntax: regexp' to match following patterns as python/perl regexps (default).
# You can use 'syntax: glob' to match following patterns as shell globs.
# You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to match a directory explicitly.
