Description: Overview
        ---------
        
        **Serval** is a high-level Scheme interpreter written in Python.
        It implements a subset of R5RS. The code closely follows
        Scheme meta-circular evaluator implementation from Ch.4 of the SICP book.
        
        
        The goal of the project
        ------------------------
        
        1. Self-education (I've been always fascinated by language
        design and implementation, it was about time I started learning about
        interpreters and compilers by actually writing something).
        
        2. To serve as a potential example for other people
        interested in interpreter implementation, particularly
        Scheme interpreter.
        
        3. Not a goal per se, but I wanted the **Serval** to be able
        to run all examples from *"The Little Schemer"* book (that was
        my test target). The project has a test module *test_the_little_schemer.py*
        which runs simple meta-circular evaluator from Ch.10 of the book.
