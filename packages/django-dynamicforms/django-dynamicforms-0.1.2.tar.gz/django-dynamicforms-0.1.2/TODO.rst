- COULD use Distribute instead of setuptools
- COULD allow a default value for e.g. text fields
- COULD change as_dict for invalid dynamicformdata
- COULD issue a warning/error message if a form is changed that makes posted data invalid (maybe use 'save as' in admin)
- COULD use 'dynamicform' in the list_filter of DynamicFieldAdmin, DynamicFormDataAdmin instead of 'dynamicform__name'
- COULD optionally use messaging framework for notifying success of posted dynamicform
- SHOULD check whether using tags in e-mails is safe
