While processing some tasks that span the PST/PDT changeover the ordering of events is broken.\n\nOptions are:\n\n1. Leave alone and try to process the datetime objects externally, somewhat easy but not a good solution as it requires duplication in each project that requires accurate date handling\n2. Start producing non-naive datetime objects, breaks any caller who is not prepared for it.\n3. Introduce a setting to toggle naive object availability, defaulting to naive objects to maintain backwards compatibility\n\n[python-dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil) makes handling option 1 quite easy, and also simplifies the handling of option 3 at the cost of another external dependency.  Option 2 is just pure evil, or pure stupidity depending on point of view.\n\nOption 3 results in a parsing using something like the following entirely untested code:\n\n    datetime_ = parser.parse(github_date)\n    if NAIVE:\n        datetime_.replace(tzinfo=None)\n    return datetime_\n\nAnd similarly producing GitHub compatible date strings would require handling of naive formats with equally untested code such as:\n\n    if NAIVE:\n        datetime_ = datetime_.replace(tz.gettz(\"America/Los_Angeles\"))\n    return datetime_.strftime(\"%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %z\")","title":"Datetime timezone handling.","diff_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/pull/39.diff","updated_at":"2011-06-07T13:56:50Z","created_at":"2011-04-30T12:37:40Z","user":{"name":"James Rowe","gravatar_id":"e40de1eb6e8a74cb96b3f07f3994f155","location":"Cambridge, UK","blog":"http://jnrowe.github.com/","type":"User","login":"JNRowe","email":"jnrowe@gmail.com"},"base":{"label":"ask:master","user":{"name":"Ask Solem Hoel","company":"RabbitMQ, VMware, Inc.","gravatar_id":"7e8b501f7f579c66ddac7e65cb7962b4","location":"London, UK","type":"User","login":"ask","email":"ask@celeryproject.org"},"ref":"master","repository":{"watchers":143,"has_downloads":true,"homepage":"http://packages.python.org/github2","pushed_at":"2011/06/06 16:15:04 -0700","created_at":"2009/04/18 08:31:12 -0700","fork":false,"has_wiki":true,"open_issues":5,"url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2","forks":50,"size":112,"private":false,"language":"Python","name":"python-github2","owner":"ask","has_issues":true,"description":"github client in python, with issues support."},"sha":"6a79f43f174acd3953ced69263c06d311a6bda56"},"mergeable":false,"patch_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/pull/39.patch","issue_created_at":"2011-04-18T15:25:47Z","labels":[],"head":{"label":"JNRowe:timezone_support","user":{"name":"James Rowe","gravatar_id":"e40de1eb6e8a74cb96b3f07f3994f155","location":"Cambridge, UK","blog":"http://jnrowe.github.com/","type":"User","login":"JNRowe","email":"jnrowe@gmail.com"},"ref":"timezone_support","repository":{"watchers":3,"has_downloads":true,"homepage":"","pushed_at":"2011/06/06 16:14:48 -0700","created_at":"2010/10/31 01:03:09 -0700","fork":true,"has_wiki":true,"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/JNRowe/python-github2","forks":0,"size":156,"private":false,"language":"Python","name":"python-github2","owner":"JNRowe","has_issues":false,"description":"github client in python, with issues support."},"sha":"a31cfb70343d3ac9d6330e6328008c0bc690a5a1"},"state":"open"},{"html_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/pull/24","issue_updated_at":"2011-01-05T00:26:07Z","gravatar_id":"5b3558b0fd5ca9c08d9061a6e51b555a","position":24.0,"number":24,"votes":0,"issue_user":{"name":"Alexander Artemenko","company":"Yandex","gravatar_id":"5b3558b0fd5ca9c08d9061a6e51b555a","location":"Moscow","blog":"http://dev.svetlyak.ru","type":"User","login":"svetlyak40wt","email":"github@svetlyak.ru"},"comments":11,"body":"Hi, I added an optional 'page' argument to receive not only last 35 commits, but all others too.
