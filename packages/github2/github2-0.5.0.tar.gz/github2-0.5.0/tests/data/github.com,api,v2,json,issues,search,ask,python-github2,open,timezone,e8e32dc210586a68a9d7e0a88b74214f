While processing some tasks that span the PST/PDT changeover the ordering of events is broken.\n\nOptions are:\n\n1. Leave alone and try to process the datetime objects externally, somewhat easy but not a good solution as it requires duplication in each project that requires accurate date handling\n2. Start producing non-naive datetime objects, breaks any caller who is not prepared for it.\n3. Introduce a setting to toggle naive object availability, defaulting to naive objects to maintain backwards compatibility\n\n[python-dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil) makes handling option 1 quite easy, and also simplifies the handling of option 3 at the cost of another external dependency.  Option 2 is just pure evil, or pure stupidity depending on point of view.\n\nOption 3 results in a parsing using something like the following entirely untested code:\n\n    datetime_ = parser.parse(github_date)\n    if NAIVE:\n        datetime_.replace(tzinfo=None)\n    return datetime_\n\nAnd similarly producing GitHub compatible date strings would require handling of naive formats with equally untested code such as:\n\n    if NAIVE:\n        datetime_ = datetime_.replace(tz.gettz(\"America/Los_Angeles\"))\n    return datetime_.strftime(\"%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %z\")","title":"Datetime timezone handling.","updated_at":"2011/05/29 08:37:08 -0700","diff_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/pull/39.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/pull/39.patch","pull_request_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/pull/39","html_url":"https://github.com/ask/python-github2/issues/39","user":"JNRowe","labels":[],"state":"open"}]}
