Description: DjangoPyPI
        ==========
        
        DjangoPyPI is a Django application that provides a re-implementation of the
        `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Path
        ____
        
        The first step is to get ``djangopypi`` into your Python path.
        
        Buildout
        ++++++++
        
        Simply add ``djangopypi`` to your list of ``eggs`` and run buildout again it
        should downloaded and installed properly.
        
        EasyInstall/Setuptools
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        If you have setuptools installed, you can use ``easy_install djangopypi``
        
        Manual
        ++++++
        
        Download and unpack the source then run::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        Django Settings
        _______________
        
        Add ``djangopypi`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and run ``syncdb`` again
        to get the database tables [#]_.
        
        Then add an include in your url config for ``djangopypi.urls``::
        
        urlpatterns = patterns("",
        ...
        url(r'', include("djangopypi.urls"))
        )
        
        This will make the repository interface be accessible at ``/pypi/``.
        
        
        
        Uploading to your PyPI
        ----------------------
        
        Assuming you are running your Django site locally for now, add the following to
        your ``~/.pypirc`` file::
        
        [distutils]
        index-servers =
        pypi
        local
        
        [pypi]
        username:user
        password:secret
        
        [local]
        username:user
        password:secret
        repository:http://localhost:8000/pypi
        
        Uploading a package: Python >=2.6
        _________________________________
        
        To push the package to the local pypi::
        
        $ python setup.py register -r local sdist upload -r local
        
        
        Uploading a package: Python <2.6
        ________________________________
        
        If you don't have Python 2.6 please run the command below to install the
        backport of the extension for multiple repositories::
        
        $ easy_install -U collective.dist
        
        Instead of using register and dist command, you can use ``mregister`` and
        ``mupload`` which are a backport of python 2.6 register and upload commands
        that supports multiple servers.
        
        To push the package to the local pypi::
        
        $ python setup.py mregister -r local sdist mupload -r local
        
        .. [#] ``djangopypi`` is South enabled, if you are using South then you will need
        to run the South ``migrate`` command to get the tables.

        * 'list_classifiers' action handler
        * Issue #3: decorators imports incompatible with Django 1.0, 1.1
        * RSS support for release index, packages
        * Distribution uploads (files for releases)

        0.3 (2010-06-09)
        ----------------
        
        * Added DOAP views of packages and releases
        * Splitting djangopypi off of chishop
        * Switched most views to using django generic views
        
        Backwards incompatible changes
        ______________________________
        
        * Refactored package/project model to support multiple owners/maintainers
        * Refactored release to match the metadata only that exists on pypi.python.org
        * Created a Distribution model for distribution files on a release
        
        0.2.0 (2009-03-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Registering projects and uploading releases now requires authentication.
        * Every project now has an owner, so only the user registering the project can
        add releases.
        * md5sum is now properly listed in the release link.
        * Project names can now have dots ('.') in them.
        * Fixed a bug where filenames was mangled if the distribution file already existed.
        * Releases now list both project name and version, instead of just version in the admin interface.
        * Added a sample buildout.cfg. Thanks to Rune Halvorsen (runeh@opera.com).
        
        Backwards incompatible changes
        ______________________________
        
        * Projects now has an associated owner, so old projects must be exported and
        imported to a new database.
