nagext module provides interface to Nagios external commands.
NagExt object uses Nagios command file to send external commands to Nagios.

common methods to run commands) and Nagios developers documentation for external
commands (http://old.nagios.org/developerinfo/externalcommands/) with the help of
nag_external_commands.py and append_generated_methods.sh
