Description: Introduction
        ============
        py3o is an elegant and scalable solution to design
        reports using OpenOffice.
        py3o.template is the templating component that takes care of
        merging your datasets with a corresponding templated OpenOffice document.
        
        It is plateform independant and does not require OpenOffice itself to generate an ODF file.
        If you want to generate a PDF or any other support output format you will then need to have
        a server with OpenOffice and to install the py3o.renderserver on it.
