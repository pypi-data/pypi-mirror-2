        Installing
        --------
        
        Step 0 - Create a facebook app
        In case you don't yet have a facebook app. You need an app to use the open graph api and make the login process work.
        You can create a facebook app at this url:
        http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php
        
        Step 1 - Settings:
        Define the settings mentioned in django_facebook/settings.py in your settings.py file
        
        Step 2 - Url config:
        add
        (r'^facebook/', include('django_facebook.urls')),
        to your global url file
        
        Step 3 - Template Context Processor
        add this line to your context processors
        'django_facebook.context_processors.facebook',
        
        Step 3 - Ensure the FB JS api is available on all pages you want to login
        [Facebook JS API](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/)
        
        Step 4 - Update your models
        
        Add to your user profile model
        about_me = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        facebook_id = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
        facebook_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
        facebook_profile_url = framework_fields.URLTextField(blank=True, null=True)
        website_url = framework_fields.URLTextField(blank=True, null=True)
        blog_url = framework_fields.URLTextField(blank=True, null=True)
        image = models.ImageField(blank=True, null=True)
        date_of_birth = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
        
        Step 5 - Template
        See examples/connect.html
