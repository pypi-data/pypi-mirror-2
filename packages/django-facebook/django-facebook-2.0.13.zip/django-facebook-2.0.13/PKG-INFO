        New in Version 2.0 Alpha
        ------------------------
        * canvas page support for facebook applications
        * mobile facebook registration support (tested with titanium FB flow)
        * less requirements (jinja, view decorator, django notify and cjson requirements removed)
        * fql support
        
        About Django Facebook
        ---------------------
        Django Facebook allows you to connect to the Facebook Open Graph API.
        Integrated with Django it becomes easy to setup a login/register via Facebook flow for your users.
        
        **Features**
        
        * Access the Facebook API, from:
        * Your website (Using javascript OAuth)
        * Facebook canvas pages (For building facebook applications)
        * Mobile (Or any other flow giving you a valid access token)
        * Django User Registration (Convert Facebook user data into a user model
        * Use Facebook data to register a user with your Django app. Facebook connect using the open graph API.
        * Facebook FQL access
        
        Works best with
        ---------------
        * Django registration
        
        TODO (again help is appreciated!)
        ---------------------------------
        * testing (especially a dummy FB api)
        * separate user data conversion and FB api improvements
        * fully replace the facebook GraphAPI which they no longer support
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Download the source code or use pip install django_facebook.
        
        
        **Create a Facebook App**
        
        In case you don't yet have a facebook app. You need an app to use the open graph api and make the login process work.
        You can create a facebook app at this url: http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php
        
        **Settings**
        
        Define the following settings in your settings.py file:
        
        ::
        
        FACEBOOK_API_KEY
        FACEBOOK_APP_ID
        FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET
        
        **Url config, context processor, auth backend**
        
        ::
        
        add django facebook to your installed apps
        'django_facebook',
        add this line to your url config
        (r'^facebook/', include('django_facebook.urls')),
        add this line to your context processors
        'django_facebook.context_processors.facebook',
        add this to your AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
        'django_facebook.auth_backends.FacebookBackend',
        
        **Update your models**
        
        Add the following fields to your profile model:
        
        ::
        
        about_me = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        facebook_id = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
        facebook_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
        facebook_profile_url = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        website_url = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        blog_url = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        image = models.ImageField(blank=True, null=True, upload_to='profile_images')
        date_of_birth = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
        raw_data = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        
        An abstract model is specified for convenience django_facebook/models.py FacebookProfileModel
        
        **Check the example**
        
        Right now you should have a working registration/connect/login in flow available at /facebook/connect/
        Test if everything is working and ensure you didn't miss a step somewhere.
        If it isn't working please open an issue.
        
        **Customize and integrate into your site**
        
        This is the hardest step of the install.
        For an example you can look at connect.html in the templates directory.
        
        First load the javascript (it loads the facebook library asynchronously).
        I recommend that you insert this code at the bottom of your page.
        
        ::
        
        <script src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}js/original/facebook.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script>
        facebookAppId = '{{ FACEBOOK_APP_ID }}';
        function facebookJSLoaded(){
        FB.init({appId: facebookAppId, status: false, cookie: true, xfbml: true});
        }
        window.fbAsyncInit = facebookJSLoaded;
        F = new facebookClass(facebookAppId);
        F.load();
        </script>
        
        Subsequently implement a form which calls Facebook via javascript.
        Note that you can control which page to go to after connect using the next input field.
        
        ::
        
        <form action="{% url facebook_connect %}?facebook_login=1" method="post">
        <a href="javascript:void(0);" style="font-size: 20px;" onclick="F.connect(this.parentNode);">Register, login or connect with facebook</a>
        <input type="hidden" value="{{ request.path }}" name="next" />
        </form>
