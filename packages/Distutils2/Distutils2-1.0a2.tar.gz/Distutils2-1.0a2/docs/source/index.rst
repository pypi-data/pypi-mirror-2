.. Distutils2 doc site master file
   This doc serves as project homepage and documentation preview
   (on distutils2.notmyidea.org) until distutils2 is merged back into

Welcome to Distutils2!
======================

a library used to package, distribute, build and install Python projects.

Documentation
-------------

These documents are the in-development version of Distutils2's documentation,
started from the existing Distutils documentation and updated by the
Distutils2 group (GSoC students, mentors, volunteers).

Please remember that this is a work in progress. The documentation is not
complete, not spell-checked, and uses different styles.

The documentation is split in three sections, as in the standard Python docs:

:doc:`install/index`
  A guide for for end-users wanting to install a Python application or
  library.

:doc:`distutils/index`
  A guide for Python developers wanting to package and distribute their
  project.

:doc:`library/distutils2`
  A reference for developers wanting to use standalone building blocks like
  :mod:`~distutils2.version` or :mod:`~distutils2.metadata`, or extend
  Distutils2 itself. Since :PEP:`376` is partly implemented in the
  :mod:`pkgutil` module, its updated documentation is also included:
  :doc:`library/pkgutil`.
