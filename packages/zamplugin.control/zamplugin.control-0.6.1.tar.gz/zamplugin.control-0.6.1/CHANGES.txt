0.6.1 (2011-02-04)
------------------

- Moved zcml package include of ``zope.applicationcontrol`` from `app.zcml`
  to `configure.zcml` so you can include `configure.zcml` (as usual) when
  using this plug-in.


0.6.0 (2011-02-03)
------------------

- Updated test setup, tests and demo application to run with ZTK 1.0, thus
  requiring ``zam.api`` >= 0.7.

- Depending on ``zope.applicationcontrol`` instead of
  ``zope.app.applicationcontrol``.

0.5.0 (2008-04-14)
------------------

- Initial release.
