0.7 (2010-09-15)
----------------

- Fixed another case where non-RFC 2047 compliant headers could cause an
  exception to be raised.  (LP #637484)

0.6 (2010-09-13)
----------------

- Added Queue.requeue_quarantined_messages() convenience method to API.

- Allow for multiple hosts in 'to_hostname' filter. (LP #614528)

- Added graceful degradation for non-RFC 2047 compliant headers, in order to
  avoid crashing when spambots send us malformed messages. (LP #637484)

0.5 (2010-08-03)
----------------

- Added 'X-Postoffice: Bounced' header to outgoing bounce and quarantine
  messages. The presence of this header is checked when importing messages and
  any messages which contain it are discarded. This is to prevent possible
  ricochets of bounce messages back into the system. (LP #612587)

- Incoming messages with a 'From' header which matches exactly its 'To' header
  are now discarded as probable spam. (LP #612588)

0.4 (2010-07-30)
----------------

- Fixed bug in processing body of bounce messages when non-ascii unicode
  characters are present.

0.3 (2010-07-20)
----------------

- Fixed divide by zero error when calculating instantaneous message frequency.

- Fixed bug in repoze.postoffice.queue.open_queue where a ZEO connection would
  be left open if there was a KeyError on the queue name.

0.2 (2010-06-29)
----------------

- Fixed bug in parsing headers with no values.

- Added ability to use arbitrary message headers as discriminator values in
  out of office loop detection.

- When messages exceed maximum message size, are throttled or are found to be
  an auto-response, they are no longer discarded.  Instead these messages get
  an 'X-Postoffice-Rejected' header added where the value gives the reason for
  rejection.  These messages are then consumable by clients in the normal way.
  It is up to the client to detect the 'X-Postoffice-Rejected' header and take
  appropriate action.  This change was made to allow the client to determine
  what, if any, sort of bounce message should be generated if any of these
  conditions are true.

0.1 (2010-06-03)
----------------

- Initial Release.
