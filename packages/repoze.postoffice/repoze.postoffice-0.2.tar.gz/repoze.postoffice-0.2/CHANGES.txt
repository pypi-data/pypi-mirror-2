0.2 (2010-06-29)
----------------

- Fixed bug in parsing headers with no values.

- Added ability to use arbitrary message headers as discriminator values in
  out of office loop detection.

- When messages exceed maximum message size, are throttled or are found to be
  an auto-response, they are no longer discarded.  Instead these messages get
  an 'X-Postoffice-Rejected' header added where the value gives the reason for
  rejection.  These messages are then consumable by clients in the normal way.
  It is up to the client to detect the 'X-Postoffice-Rejected' header and take
  appropriate action.  This change was made to allow the client to determine
  what, if any, sort of bounce message should be generated if any of these
  conditions are true.
