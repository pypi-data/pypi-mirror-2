Description: This app allows you to convert back and fourth between Django model
        objects and fixed width record format.
        
        These fixed width record format objects are referred to as Copybook
        objects because their original purpose was to allow communication between
        a Django application and a Cobol application.
        
        The copybook objects allow serialization of Django objects into a fixed
        width format that Cobol copybooks can understand.
