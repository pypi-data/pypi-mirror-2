Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package applies a blue color theme to the eea.facetednavigation interface.
        
        Three CSS files are used:
        
        * view.css - always loaded, contains CSS overrides for the facetednavigation
          styles displayed on view;
        
        * edit.css - loaded for the configuration page;
        
        * js.css - always loaded, contains JavaScript and plugins overrides.
        
        Replacement images are also provided (used for loading animations and
        placeholder indicators on the configuration page)
        
        The CSS overrides work by simply providing a more exact selector for
        the elements. This is accomplished by placing `div` in front of the
        default facetednavigation selector, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            div .tags-cloud li {
              color: #CDE0EF;
            }
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``eea.faceted.blue`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eea.faceted.blue
        
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                eea.faceted.blue
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
