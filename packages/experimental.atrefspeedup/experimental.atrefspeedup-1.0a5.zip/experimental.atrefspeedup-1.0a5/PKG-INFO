Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        *Note: This code has been merged into Products.Archetypes and will be part of
        any Plone 4.1 and later release.*
        
        At the heart of the Archetypes reference engine is the reference_catalog. This
        is a set of catalog indexes used to perform the actual query lookups.
        
        The choice of using a ZCatalog has lead to some data structures which aren't
        suited for handling references.
        
        This project tries to work around some of the short comings of the internal
        implementation of the reference engine without changing the public API or
        making any other changes to the stored data.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0a5 - 2011-08-02
        ------------------
        
        - Don't use `isdisjoint`, as it's not available on Python < 2.6.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a4 - 2010-11-22
        ------------------
        
        - Deal gracefully with missing uid catalog entries for references.
          [hannosch, stefan]
        
        1.0a3 - 2010-11-05
        ------------------
        
        - Speed up `getReferences` and `getBackReferences` of `Referenceable` objects.
          We no longer load the reference objects themselves but work directly with the
          information on the brains.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Speed up `getTargetObject` and `getSourceObject` on reference objects.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a2 - 2010-11-04
        ------------------
        
        - Support passing in a list of relationships into the `getReferences` and
          `getBackReferences` methods.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0a1 - 2010-10-18
        ------------------
        
        - Initial implementation.
