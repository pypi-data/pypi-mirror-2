        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages YUI_ for `hurry.resource`_. It is aware of YUI's
        dependency structure and different modes (normal, minified and debug)
        and resource rollups.
        
        .. _`hurry.resource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.resource
        
        .. _YUI: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import various bits of YUI from ``hurry.yui`` and ``.need``
        them where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          from hurry import yui 
        
          .. in your page or widget rendering code, somewhere ..
        
          yui.datatable.need()
        
        All the module names as listed here_ are available in the
        ``hurry.yui`` package. In addition rolled up modules are also
        available (such as ``reset_fonts_grids``), but rollup inclusion will
        be done automatically so these need not to be referred to
        explicitly. See the `hurry.resource`_ documentation for more
        information.
        
        .. _here: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/#modulenames
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and
        ``hurry.resource``, and making sure that the original resources
        (shipped in the ``yui-build`` directory in ``hurry.yui``) are
        published to some URL.
        
        The package has already been integrated for Grok_ and Zope 3. If you
        depend on the `hurry.zopeyui`_ package in your ``setup.py``, the above
        example should work out of the box. Starting with version 2.6.0.4 you
        do not need `hurry.zopeyui`_ anymore. Instead it is sufficient to
        depend on the `hurry.zoperesource`_ package in your ``setup.py``.
        
        .. _`hurry.zopeyui`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zopeyui
        
        .. _`hurry.zoperesource`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.zoperesource
        
        .. _Grok: http://grok.zope.org
        
        Preparing hurry.yui before release
        ==================================
        
        This section is only relevant to release managers of ``hurry.yui``.
        
        The javascript code that this package relies on is not checked into
        subversion to sidestep the copyright policy of svn.zope.org. Instead,
        just before release to pypi, an entry point is triggered that
        downloads the appropriate javascript code. To trigger this automated
        behavior you should do the release using ``bin/fullrelease``, which
        uses zest.releaser configured with the appropriate entry points.
        
        To update to a newer version of YUI, adjust the constants in
        ``hurry/yui/prepare.py``.
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        2.7.0.1 (2010-07-29)
        ====================
        
        * Compatibility with hurry.resource 0.10 and up.
        
        * Automate YUI download during release with zest.releaser.
        
        2.7.0 (2009-09-07) (YUI version 2.7.0)
        ======================================
        
        * Updated to YUI version 2.7.0.
        
        2.6.0.4 (2009-04-28) (YUI version 2.6.0)
        ========================================
        
        * Add ZCML configuration from `hurry.zopeyui`. With Zope you can now
          use `hurry.yui` without additional `hurry.zopeyui`. Please make
          sure, however, that `hurry.zoperesource` is available at runtime.
        
        2.6.0.3 (2008-12-03) (YUI version 2.6.0)
        ========================================
        
        * Add the sam skin to hurry.yui. This is the consolidated minified SAM
          skin - the split up .css files would require more work to implement.
        
        2.6.0.2 (2008-10-15) (YUI version 2.6.0)
        ========================================
        
        * Update to work with hurry.resource 0.3.
        
        * Extend tests to exercise minification of rolled up resources.
        
        2.6.0.1 (2008-10-13) (YUI version 2.6.0)
        ========================================
        
        * Much improved documentation.
        
        2.6.0 (2008-10-11) (YUI version 2.6.0)
        ======================================
        
        * Initial public release.
