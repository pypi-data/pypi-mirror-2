2.7.0.1 (2010-07-29)
====================

2.7.0 (2009-09-07) (YUI version 2.7.0)
======================================

2.6.0.4 (2009-04-28) (YUI version 2.6.0)
========================================

* Add ZCML configuration from `hurry.zopeyui`. With Zope you can now
  use `hurry.yui` without additional `hurry.zopeyui`. Please make
  sure, however, that `hurry.zoperesource` is available at runtime.

2.6.0.3 (2008-12-03) (YUI version 2.6.0)
