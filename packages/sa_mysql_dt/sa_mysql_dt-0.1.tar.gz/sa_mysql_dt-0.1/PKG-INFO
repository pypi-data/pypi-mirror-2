Description: sa_mysql_dt
        ***********
        
        MySQL, unlike for instance, PostgreSQL, doesn't support datetime
        columns with a sub-second granularity. This means that it is not
        possible to distinguish between two datetimes that were generated in
        the same second.
        
        This can however be very useful. This package defines a new field type
        for SQLAlchemy that should be a drop-in replacement for the standard
        SQLAlchemy DateTime. It stores its information in a Numeric column to
        enable sub-second granularity. 
        
        It's probably also not properly timezone aware.
        
        To use it in a SQLAlchemy table definition as a column type, import it
        instead of SQLAlchemy's version::
        
          >>> from sa_mysql_dt import DateTime
