Description: =============================================================
        zodbupdate - Update existing databases to match your software
        =============================================================
        
        This package provides a tool that automatically identifies and updates
        references from persistent objects to classes that are in the process of being
        moved from one module to another and/or being renamed.
        
        If a class is being moved or renamed, you need to update all references from
        your database to the new name before finally deleting the old code.
        
        This tool looks through all current objects of your database,
        identifies moved/renamed classes and `touches` objects accordingly. It
        creates transactions that contains the update of your database (one
        transaction every 100000 records).
        
        Having run this tool, you are then free to delete the old code.

        Usage
        =====
        
        Installing the egg of this tool provides a console script `zodbupdate` which
        you can call giving either a FileStorage filename or a configuration file
        defining a storage::
        
            $ zodbupdate -f Data.fs
            $ zodbupdate -c zodb.conf
        
        Detailed usage information is available:
        
            $ zodbupdate -h
        
        Custom software/eggs
        --------------------
        
        It is important to install this egg in an interpreter/environment where your
        software is installed as well. If you're using a regular Python installation
        or virtualenv, just installing the package using easy_install should be fine.
        
        If you are using buildout, installing can be done using the egg recipe with
        this configuration::
        
            [buildout]
            parts += zodbupdate
        
            [zodbupdate]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = zodbupdate
                <list additional eggs here>
        
        If you do not install `zodbupdate` together with the necessary software it
        will report missing classes and not touch your database.
        
        Non-FileStorage configurations
        ------------------------------
        
        You can configure any storage known to your ZODB installation by providing a
        ZConfig configuration file (similar to zope.conf). For example you can connect
        to a ZEO server by providing a config file `zeo.conf`::
        
            <zeoclient>
                server 127.0.0.1:8100
                storage 1
            </zeoclient>
        
        And then running `zodbupdate` using:
        
            $ zodbupdate -c zeo.conf
        
        
        Pre-defined rename rules
        ------------------------
        
        Rename rules can be defined using entry points::
        
            setup(...
                  entry_points = """
                  [zodbupdate]
                  renames = mypackage.mymodule:rename_dict
                  """)
        
        Rename rules are dictionaries that map old class names to new class names::
        
            renames = {'mypackage.mymodule ClassName':
                       'otherpackage.othermodule OtherClass'}
        
        As soon as you have rules defined, you can already remove the old
        import location mentioned in them.
        
        
        Packing
        -------
        
        The option ``--pack`` will pack the storage on success. (You tell your
        users to use that option. If they never pack their storage, it is a good
        occasion).
        
        
        Problems and solutions
        ----------------------
        
        Your Data.fs has POSKey errors
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you call `zodbupdate` with ``-f`` and the path to your Data.fs,
        records triggering those errors will be ignored.
        
        
        Your Data.fs is old, have been created with Zope 2 and you get strange errors
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Some special support for an old record format got removed from Python
        2.6. Running `zodbupdate` with the Python pickler (``-p Python``) will
        load those records and fix them.
        
        This will fix your Data.fs.
        
        You have an another error
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We recommand to run zodbupdate with ``-v -d -p Python`` to get the
        maximum of information.
        
        If you are working on big storages, you can use the option ``-o`` to
        re-run `zodbupdate` at a failing record you previously encountered
        afterward.
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.4 (2010-07-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Add an option to debug broken records.
        
        - Add an option to skip records.
        
        - Add an option to use Python unPickler instead of C one. This let you
          debug records. As well Python unPickler let you update old ExtensionClass
          records who had a special hack in the past.
        
        - Broken interfaces are well supported now (if you did alsoProvides with them).
        
        
        0.3 (2010-02-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Unplickle and re-pickle the code to rename references to moved classes.
          This make the script works on database created with older versions of
          ZODB.
        
        - If you are working directly with a FileStorage, POSKeyError are reported
          but non-fatal.
        
        - Remove superfluous code that tried to prevent commits when no changes
          happened: ZODB does this all by itself already.
        
        0.2 (2009-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Add option to store the rename rules into a file.
        
        - Don't commit transactions that have no changes.
        
        - Load rename rules from entry points ``zodbupdate``.
        
        - Compatibility with Python 2.4
        
        - Rename from ``zodbupgrade`` to ``zodbupdate``.
        
        - Add 'verbose' option.
        
        - Improve logging.
        
        - Suppress duplicate log messages (e.g. if the same class is missing in
          multiple objects).
        
        - Improve the updating process: rewrite pickle opcodes instead of blindly
          touching a class. This also allows updating pickles that can't be unpickled
          due to missing classes.
        
        0.1 (2009-06-08)
        ----------------
        
        - First release.
