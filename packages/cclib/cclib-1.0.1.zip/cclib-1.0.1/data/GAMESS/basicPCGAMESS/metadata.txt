Original input file created using GaussView with C2h symmetry and saved as Cartesian coordinates.
After GeoOpt of this, the final coordinates were used as the input for a single point energy calculations (unrestricted, no sym) and an IR calculation. For the Raman calculation, the $GRAD and $HESS sections were cut from the PUNCH file of the IR calc and pasted into the Raman calc input file.
