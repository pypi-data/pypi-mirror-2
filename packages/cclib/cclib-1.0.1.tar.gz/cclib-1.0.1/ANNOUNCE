cclib 1.0.1 is now available for download from http://cclib.sf.net.

cclib is an open source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages. It currently parses output files from ADF, Firefly, GAMESS (US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar, Molpro and ORCA.

Among other data, cclib extracts:

    * coordinates and energies
    * information about geometry optimization
    * atomic orbital information
    * molecular orbital information
    * information on vibrational modes
    * the results of a TD-DFT calculation 

(For a complete list see http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cclib/index.php?title=Parsed_Data).

cclib also provides some calculation methods for interpreting the electronic properties of molecules using analyses such as:

    * Mulliken and Lowdin population analyses
    * Overlap population analysis
    * Calculation of Mayer's bond orders. 

(For a complete list see http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cclib/index.php?title=Calculation_Methods).
