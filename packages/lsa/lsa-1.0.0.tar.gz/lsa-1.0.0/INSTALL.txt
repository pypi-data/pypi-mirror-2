        $ lsa-compuate.py -h
        $ lsa-query.py -h

Win32 (This Part Is OUTDATED, Currently Not Supported):

    0. open a command line by run "cmd" command, it will give you a DOS prompt "..\>"
       >

    2. eye check numpy version is >= 1.0, it is at the last line:
        $ pydoc numpy.version
    if not, download and install it from: http://www.scipy.org

    3. check scipy version is >= 0.6, it is at the last line:
        $ pydoc scipy.version

       you can now check again by:

    7 test the executables:
